Nothing.

M ³ ³ young man Young man, the nicely cope up the EOE
of these weeds yesterday.

46
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,400
Is $ 5 will be all right?

47
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,800
All right.

48
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:30,600
Thank you.

49
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,900
No way, yet no weeding ¿³ EOE
yesterday no reviews of weeds.

50
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,100
I know that.

51
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,000
- What's going on?
- The day of money.

52
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,200
Day of money?

53
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,500
I do not know why,
but recently it happens very often.

54
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,500
Deewy, people do not have the
Days Money.

55
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,200
I have.

56
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,400
These are the days of the ¿cookies
and day cap on his head half.

57
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,700
For those do not like too much ...

58
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:52,700
But before you know it,
Again comes the day of money.

59
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,400
What are you doing?

60
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,400
I put it g the pole fence,
for the third time this month.

61
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,900
We had with Earl lot of troubles k
c erases them.

62
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,600
What? Why mielibyœcie
delete our fence?

63
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:09,400
We have 300 cows that we napoiæ.

64
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,000
- We then przechodziæ to water.
- The fence is all we need.

65
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,200
Last escaped us were two horses
s and the whole of the busiest week for us to find them.

66
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:18,000
Our ranch in ¿uses
This watering hole for over 50 years.

67
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,200
We will not change the the group of
townsfolk playing the ponies smokers themselves.

68
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:27,500
It also does not mean we agrotourism,
Also I do not work in the same way you ¿ko, like you.

69
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:34,400
Hey cowboy,
œmieszna your purse is ringing.

70
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,700
What is it?

71
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:44,700
The co lavender soaps should be
right next to the shampoo.

72
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:47,100
He asks the EOE in servicing the hotel?

73
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:50,000
In the end I start rozumieæ trigonometry.

74
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:50,900
It is useless ¿useful.

75
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:55,100
Come on, trigonometry is needed.

76
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,400
You're right, it is useless ¿useful.

77
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,300
- I'm seeing you in school.
- Yes?

78
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,800
Honestly said the c ..
large for the am thinking about you.

79
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,800
These are ¿s heard the I!

80
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,500
Serious is not it?

81
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,400
I know you're very smart,
So I have a question ...

82
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,700
Do you have a planned
Each moment of your life?

83
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,100
- I do not think ¿ebym ...
- Planning! I know you did.

84
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,700
Are you sure you Know-always,
what will happen in a moment.

85
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:21,300
Do not you?

86
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:25,200
No. Not very fond of Know-
which will in a moment.

87
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,600
Even when it's terrible.

88
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,800
In a properly even likes it
when it's scary.

89
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,500
As for example, at the moment.
I do not know what's going to happen for a while.

90
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,300
- Do you know?
- So ...

91
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,500
- Jakieœ progress?
- What?

92
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,200
Math.
Wages you for $ 6 per hour.

93
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,700
Oh yes.
She very quickly for the apuje.

94
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,700
There can flow for Grip the,
when I've attempted it explained by the manufac.

95
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,400
Nothing attempted EOE t explained by,
EOE only the screaming at me.

96
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:55,500
Fall out of the schools were average, so for each time,
when something makes you feel also were no screams.

97
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:58,000
I'm sure that if you wanted to,
Such use would you nauczyæ trigonometry.

98
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,800
When?
If I was to Vietnam?

99
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:05,500
Emaciated, related the zany in a cage
tigers immersed in the Mekong?

100
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,500
I suppose that the no.

101
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,800
Remember wearing something m³ dralo.

102
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,600
I and many of my dead buddies

103
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,500
gone through the the the the a certain in death, you ¿ebyœ
and your little friends have FREEDOM,

104
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,200
and could uczyæ up trigonometry.

105
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,500
Thank you ... sir.

106
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:31,600
That was a terrible.

107
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,600
Come on, for each time
t his plays are the crib.

108
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:36,800
In some foreign Zesz week attempted in the Insert,
¿Eby dostaæ free set of McDonald's.

109
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,200
These are the I think that we should
return to mathematics.

110
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,300
Or you can the crap
avoid the topic and the owaæ kiss me.

111
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,800
Poca the owaæ you?
Apparently, you're crazy.

112
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,500
Your dad is jakieœ
10 meters hence the d

113
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,600
Do you want to lead to a situation
when at the catching me.

114
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:52,300
And they got kicked in the back of the piece
I do not think I look at it ...

115
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,500
Reese part, how you doing?

116

I Think of em, why not pomalowaæ
kitchen cabinets?

119
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,800
I will make the pancakes.

120
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,200
Pancakes?

121
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,200
Come on, sit down.

122
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,500
We have strawberries,
bananas, peaches.

123
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:12,900
Syrup's own work,

00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,300
I told the mother,
IDE also to the library tomorrow.

309
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,700
But in truth we
tomorrow to the library.

310
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,900
I was thinking of that the we
to meet church services.

311
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,300
No, meeting church services
in the next week.

312
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,900
It is only able to cover ¿ebyœmy
spotkaæ on a lake.

313
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,300
I was thinking of that the lake
is undercover for the bowling?

314
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:21,000
No, I should be
the bowling at the moment.

315
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:21,900
This is madness.

316
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I know I can I will be even
more crazy.

317
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,200
Oh my God, my dad!

318
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:33,100
/ - Did you come to say that the're going bowling!
/ - Will change the am sentence.

319
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,000
/ - Stop me œledziæ. Do not you trust me?
/ - Quiet.

320
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,700
/ - Do not shush me.

321
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,500
/ Learn to be quiet,
/ When will someone stabs of you

322
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:44,800
/ Bamboo splinters under the fingernails
/ Byœ of your betray the comp.

323
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,800
- It is worth it, definitely.

324
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,800
For me the continuity Bosk ...

325
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,900
Flooding of the car with concrete
was to shocking as brilliant.

326
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,400
With Billy Prescot as the sacrificial goat of em
we can zrobiæ everything.

327
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,800
I prepared a list of enemies.

328
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,600
Deewey ...
Deewey, I'm talking to you.

329
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,900
Is that enough?

330
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,400
Oh, yes.

331
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:46,000
I know what you think,
but you do not realize,

332
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,000
I'm also
Reese true.

333
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,300
Just the appearance of the dam,
like me ... he did.

334
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,700
But if the harm us,
I mean it ...

335
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,800
Just drive.

336
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Now that you've finished with the carpet
we can ociepliæ attic.

337
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:15,000
I'm telling you baby,
the value of the house as much as triple.

338
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,200
We can earlier
change over pensions.

339
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,000
- Lois, as planned Did you come?
- Nothing.

340
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,700
Lois zgodziliœmy up.

341
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:30,600
OK, it takes two to tango,
and I'm not going tañczyæ.

342
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,800
I just do not dance!

343
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:37,400
And do you think that the it will switch,?

344
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,900
The message I have for you, kobietko.

345
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:45,600
I do a lot of things male.
I started the lubiæ of my new force,

346
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:49,200
and I will not discount ¿AAE up
to yours, animal level.

347
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:52,400
Leave the belt for the deposit located.

348
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,000
I'm sick and tired
your eluding.

349
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,900
You're never there,
where we will also speak.

350
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,900
There you can take with me a fool.

351
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Dad, you're paranoid!
Nothing much is happening.

352
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,300
Besides, what is sitting
in your g half.

353
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:11,700
If you know sure that the angle of You're lying,
ignition acisz for a real hell of em.

354
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,900
Are you all right?

355
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I lose the feeling in the hands,
but the pain in the shoulder does not allow the myœleæ.

356
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:26,700
Poor thing ...

357
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:30,300
Listen to Nicki,
I'm not sure that's gonna work.

358
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,300
What do you mean?

359
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,300
We do all of these things:

360
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:35,200
escapes,
develop complex plans ...

361
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,900
This œwietna fun ...

362
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:39,800
I never feel I czegoœ of such
¿in your life, but ...

363
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,700
- Is this it?
- What would you tell?

364
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:44,800
Do not do this,
every other normal couple.

365
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,400
No I do not know about you, other than that,
Fail for ck exposed himself to danger.

366
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,200
And I will do the same.

367
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:54,400
I just do not know
it will be enough.

368
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,800
I think that precisely in the EOE offended me.

369
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,500
- Do not.
- At precisely that the so.

370
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,800
Can you not know anything about me,

371
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,600
but I at least I try to
dowiedzieæ as much as possible about you.

372
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:06,600
Do not like you because
I also ¹ bottom emotions.

373
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,900
I like you because you're
funny, attentive,

374
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,300
and do not leave me
same problems.

375
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,100
Even when you complain,
you're funny.

376
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,200
I never have zastanawiaæ what I say,
because it just comes straight out.

377
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:18,500
And it is that feeling of me,
I feel safe.

378
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,600
Wait a minute.

379
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,100
I like you,
because they're funny and honest.

380
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,600
I do not feel cheated if I was to,
When you are to me I of a

381
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:27,100
You're awesome
in the company of my friends.

382
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:30,700
're Just amazing.

383
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,800
OK, so it is not serious.

384
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,100
It's not just about emotions
or anything else.

385
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,200
It is not serious

386
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,800
I'm sorry for you also shout of em.

387

zrobiæ work today.

391
