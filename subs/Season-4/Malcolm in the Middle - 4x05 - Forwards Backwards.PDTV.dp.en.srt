They're your friends, right?

159

166
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,600
And guess what?
I'm better at it.

00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,400
- This is terrible.
- Heinous than that?

186
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,200
Dewey, I'll tell you a secret.

00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:39,600
Not serious, humiliation is the only thing
which speaks to the Pacana.

194
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:42,800
- All right.

Os judging you ... as grown-ego!

201
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:34,800
And yes, I'm looking of a serious literature drawn,

202
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:42,500
- There was the gentleman already here someday?
- No, I ...

203
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:47,000
Well, Listen to FIG.
I just want to Buy a present for his son, you know?

204
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,800
That's not a crime.

205
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,800
Because my only crime
is not so large as to know how yours.

206
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,300
I think we all have parents, right?

207

This one is called "Dead Man's Shoes".
It costs 50 bucks.

211
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:15,400
He talks about alienation.
I think that will appeal to your son.

212

Thank you.

This transaction does not concern you, Feldspar.

Can that we should check in "Overstreet"?
Wait, we do not.

He holds the'd go in the bathroom,
but not for reading.

222

Except that the deposit was to would find it easier,
because we would be castrated.

Everything boils down to this,

And at this point it must skoñczyæ.

279
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:59,300
Revenge is not worth it?
Now do you think so?

280
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:03,200
We are happy?
There is no reason to mutual rivalry.
