25
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:51,500
Honey, I know that the poorly it looks as,
but it is the beginning of great expansion.

26
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:55,800
I have a sketch. See how
I'm running on for the hand?

27
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,800
It will be something much of any for you
and the child, the seat by the window.

28
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,200
Promise me you will not be also in the a

29
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,000
Hal, I'm so glad that the return of am.

30
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,600
My sister is the most hideous,

know the c the people are, as the know!

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,100
Each d the time of my visit and to spend the

33
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,000
pointing out to me what to do poorly the am
in life. That was awful.

34
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,700
Do not have to speak. Walking with her the
the five worst years of my life ¿.

35
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,800
EOE He knew that the this is, right?

36
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,800
And my parents?
Susan was to them, and for the most important.

37
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,100
Susan to the ¹ m and p are the dr.
It's a Susan had the talent.

38
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,000
But I do all the am poorly.

39
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:36,000
- Hal, thinking of am therefore on Rees.
- As if you had the and too little about the worries.

40
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,800
No, Hal. We do not
it sufficient that trust.

41
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,000
If we give him more responsibility,
he would take up the challenge.

42
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,400
I'm not talking about giving him the keys
home, or something like that.

43
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,000
I think that jakaœ incentives would do him good.

44
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,800
Approx.

45
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,100
Honey, come here!

46
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,700
The chicks were hatched up!

47
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,300
Good.

48
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:06,100
- Dewey? Mom is in the house.
- What?

49
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,200
Oh, right.

50
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,400
Repair walls will kosztowaæ $ 800.

51
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,700
I think I can flow return to work at the pharmacy.

52
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,300
Really?

53
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,400
It seems to me that
I can also become eight hours a day.

54
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,300
And when they fall, the liquid is
amniotic provides cushioning.

55
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,400
Something wymyœlimy.

56
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,400
The garage is full of unused not already been used junk.

57
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,100
Can we issue them on the lawn
and we'll see if we can be sprzedaæ?

58
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:33,100
- You think the sell-off garage ¿s this?
- This idea was œwietny, Reese.

59
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,500
- Do not carefully ved that the idea of ??a œwietny, Hal?
- That I will tell you ...

60
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,600
And you know what?
You'll be the boss.

61
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,800
You can posegregowaæ lumber,
Establish the price, select the date.

62
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,600
- Why? Nothing I do the.
- Reese, this is not a punishment.

63
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:50,000
It turns out you our confidence, because I know
Œwietnie also can handle.

64
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,300
We believe in you!
Truth Hal?

65
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,200
For me the continuity's sake, he's my son.
I love it.

66
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,000
Answer the question, Hal.

67
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,800
- Who wants some juice?
- Me!

68
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,700
/ You can not sprzedaæ
/ All my stuff!

69
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:09,000
Things in the garage with a ¹
precious memories of childhood.

70
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,600
This pile of old magazines
broken yo-yo

71
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,000
Rubik's cube and painted
in one color.

72
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,800
- You tried Did you come to the set j!
- I will not be with you angle the OCIA.

73
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,700
You have 10 seconds to give a good
reason, or the garbage dump.

74
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:25,900
That's why you're a horrible mother ¹ ¹,
because everything is the rivalry for you!

75
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,500
- Not true!

76
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,600
- Roz the connector first.
- No, I spread the connector ... Damn!

77
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,700
You can not just rozmawiaæ
of the family, Francis.

78
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,200
There is nothing more important than the present ...

79
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:42,000
Take a look! This is a letter from
our son, Rutger!

80
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:47,100
- We have to immediately retract.
- Why do you hide a letter from his son?

81
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,800
- Otto, no!
- What are you doing?

82
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,600
Nothing, because nothing is fixed about

83
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:53,900
Nothing is constant o

84
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,900
Besides me, the said the CYM that the nothing is fixed about

85
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,900
It's a constant, but only that.

86
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,300
Things begin to operate normally again ... Now!

87
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,700
Look, a post office future

Thank you, darling.

90
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,100
Not important what happens to the child.

91
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,600
Reese, if at first you insert you to heavy
and the pud and then give a light ...

It's pirate radio station transmitter,
as the results of the studies em!

96
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:36,200
It is of the power, but I say the truth to people
within 3 blocks from campus.

97
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:40,200
As long as the FCC (American National Broadcasting Council)
and the silence of me for it.

98
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,600
And for lack of a license.

99
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,800
- You see, it operates a ..
- I wanted to just be polite.

I was not thinking of,
Also punish me for it.

101

/ Hal, I will water the AAE for the second time!

134
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:32,000
There are so many things
that the government hides from us.

135
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:35,600
And that's why I do not want the Kid
Charlemagne at the microphone!

136

I'll be watching the cartoons are possible.

¯ there is no task
more than 20 minutes.

151
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,700

Not important at any robiæ you also,

164

Approx. No one can expect that the hostess
Home of przedmieœæ will understand.

167
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,100
Dewey, what are you doing?

168
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,700
Five of tennis ball is not ¿le of EAE with beautiful hands,
but with ceramic bananas.

169
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,800
This g of stupidity. Why sort
everything according colors?

170
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,400
Because so he said I was!

175
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,600
- Oh, my God also? Is it Nortare?
- It Nortare 680B.

176
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
This is the first personal computer.

177
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:51,400
- Interest in such things, right?
- There has been a lot of them.

178
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,700
- I'll give you five bucks for it.
- Even you! I check the network.

179
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:58,200
It is œwietnym condition.
It is worth at least $ 1,300.

180
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:01,500
It stands! No turning back, pretending
Also nothing You said, without appeal in the calculation.

181
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,500
You understand that the gain
money it will take me a few days?

182
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,500
Exactly what I want.

183
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,800
I want ebyœ ¿³ buy it
On Saturday, the sell-¿y

184
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:12,000
In front of everyone.
The cash.

185
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:15,400
¿Will be frightened wife, and let me tell you,
Reese also wanted to go disposed immediately.

186
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,000
And then tell all
Also they should listen to me only.

187
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:22,400
Now you sound like black
character in the film of James Bond.

188
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,800
Me!
Nothing is with me poorly!

189
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,400
I feel good.
And it is good. Good!

190
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,600
And on Saturday, we all are aware the.

191
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,600
Ok, but such plans revenge
May often the opposite effect.

192
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
So between us, as
thinking about something to someone zrobiæ course of the former,

193
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,800
do not do it on an empty ¿³ of the stomach.

194
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:45,000
/ Someone watching you through Satellite
/ And hold your finger on the beam spuœcie death.

195
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,500
/ And somewhere, someone watching him.

196
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,300
/ But who's watching them ...?

197
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,000
Oh no!

198
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,900
Do you know why you stopped the em?

199
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,700
Certainly not for keeping
pirate radio station.

200
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,600
Even if I had the right
Equipment in college,

201
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,500
do not hold me to it for the day.

202
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,400
Why so many questions!
Do you have a warrant?!

203
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,700
Not noticed that the stop sign you previously km.

204
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,400
What?
There is no stop sign.

205
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,600
It is next to the driveway to the golf club.
I recently put it.

206
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:38,300
The stop sign is a declaration of war!

207
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:41,200
It is for the background uœciochów
Play the smokers themselves there in golf.

208
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:44,200
When we, the ordinary people
œpieszymy to other work,

209
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,600
or to a church,
or for dinner with the family.

210
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,500
I'm sorry, also I do not see the
Bobby's first steps,

211
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,900
but I had to stop himself,
only because

212
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,900
Also you do not aristocrats
patrzeæ the skill on both sides.

213
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,400
Gretchen, what are you doing?

214
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:02,600
I watch the things Rutger
from the time of his childhood.

215
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,800
I do not remember, also that of the fat.

216
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,400
- Shlupi!
- Who is Shlupi?

217
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,300
Rutger Otto loved Shlupiego.

218
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:20,200
Otto assumes the Shlupiego,
and Rutger up and œmia œmia of the.

219
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,400
He was almost his m³ little brother.

220
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:27,200
Shlupi He could tell all the
things that Otto was not able to.

221
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,900
For example, "The Ides break loose"
or "b-governments polite"

222
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,800
"Take that finger, that's disgusting!"

223
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,700
It would were beautiful times.

224
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:41,800
And now, ... he is not.

225
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,200
Gretchen, I can not patrzeæ you suffer.
You porozmawiaæ with Otto.

226
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,400
It will not work, he never
pleaded not of an error.

227
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,100
You got the money, right?

228
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,900
Yes, the cost of me are three figures
of a small bowl of Captain Lou and placard!

229
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,700
I'll get on the computer.
You REMARK scenario.

230
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:21,100
Reese is œwietny idea was that the
probably trying to help this old lady.

231
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,300
But what the hell.

232
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,700
- I can help somehow something?
- How much is a vacuum cleaner?

233
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,300
This is set.
You can go to Buy only from the lamps.

234
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,000
- But you do not need a lamp.
- So you do not need a vacuum cleaner!

235
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:38,200
He'll come back here. A lamp
we take even a blender.

236
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,800
I can see that the large over this way of thinking about the EOE.

237
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,500
Where again been solved your father?

238
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:49,300
And then the army will move the stop sign to fight,

239
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:54,200
and will be their support of the company
reinforcing the golf club.

240
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,700
But it's not over yet.

241
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,200
Ok, that's the Hear.

242
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:03,300
How many characters before the stop sign?
Eight!

243
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,000
That's almost as many judges
S sits in the Supreme Court a slower day.

244
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,100
Wait, America.

00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,200
Buys jet
for cash from the sell-¿y

302
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,400
It's not your the money.
For not rebuild the wall in the bedroom.

303
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,300
But Did you come to say that the I command.
And that means that they got the money.

304
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,400
No, I do not mean!

305
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,100
So why, I've had the dowodziæ?

306
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,200
Reese, it had the help of
become a better part of the human being.

307
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,600
Lift the sense of one's own values.

308
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:33,600
What you apparently need
because you're so stupid g ³, ¿Eby wywaliæ $ 1,300,

309
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,000
that the family desperately needs!

310
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,500
Co-operate!
I've never met the guy of em!

311
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,300
I hate the Constitution?
I hate freedom of speech!

312
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,000
- I'm a snitch! I do not know!
- What the hell!

313
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,100
Stop!

We have a warrant! Escape

315
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,000
Otto, Wychody, I know you are also here.

316
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,500
This is ridiculous, you're sitting here for three days.

317
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,900
I know you do not want to speak about it.

318
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,700
But you can not do these continuously ukrywaæ.

I do not know what przestawaæ because
Nothing is constant o Hence the OdejdŸ!

323
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:30,500
If there is something that I'm an expert,
that are nonsensical family disputes.

324
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:34,600
And if Rutger is similar to me,
it will have the zrobiæ first move.

325
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,300
You will need to reconcile themselves
with your feelings.

326
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,000

329
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,000

Rutger has not arrived when the.

332
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:10,200
Then comes the s list.
That was a very painful.

333
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,400

340
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,800

be confused as to Rees?

Hal, tell it again,
I want to hear a.

342

Wow, Francis.
From where they are up for the Feel invited?

351
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:11,700
I do not know.

352
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:13,900
I think I had the breakthrough.

353
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:17,000
