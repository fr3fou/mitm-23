54
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:32,000
So ... How do you like America?

My brothers read off that

Never thinking of I,
Also I miss her for the.

Yet I do not miss,

00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:11,000
You wrong as it sounds, but at least
You end up with a month of the or two.

By the way, says the am you also my

Why are you still talking,
Such g of silly comments?

77
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:55,800
According to Trish, a normal
reaction to a girl

Nobody said anything of

82
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,400
This can seriously time n the conversation.

83
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:13,800
Ok, what you want to speak?
How much Trish hates me?

84
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,800
No payment of the comb out of this angle of the canvas.

Ignition acisz for it when you come back your mother!

Already well, honey.
Go back to sleep.

100
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,000
Approx.

101
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,200
Why she can ¿le nude EAE
on the kitchen table, and I do not?

102
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,500
Dewey, if every cop you also
zrobiæ something, you do it.

103

What are you doing? Long ago
the sermons I AEOI you break loose!

104
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:36,000
In a properly Dad, You said:
"IdŸcie break loose."

105
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,200
And not:
"IdŸcie break loose now."

106
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,900
If you leave us so the gap
it is not our fault.

107

The last time there

He was the EOE entire night away from home?

115
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,600
Believe me, I've planned the wróciæ this late stage.

116
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,900
I suppose also that the EOE
imprisoned somewhere, huh?

00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:26,800
Move the I is already in Reese
and Francis, it never lasts for the long.

154
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:31,500
Reese sat on the roof until
not lost the fight with a bunch of the cats.

155
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,800
So you do not mind,
Malcolm also spend the night

156
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,200
on the CYM alcohol stink mattress
To some dark alley?

157
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,400
- Craig ...
- Oh God, he already can not Insert!

158
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:42,000
- Malcolm knows about himself zadbaæ.
- Right, right, is a genius.

159
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:46,000
But it is attractive to governmental,
secret military programs.

160
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,500
How much time is needed ¿Eby
kidnapped him to the government scientists

161
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:51,000
And I try to surgically
reunite him with jakimœ animal?

162
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,300
Stop playing!

163
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,300
The end of the piano!

164
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,600
The end of the piano!

165
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,300
Just stop playing!

166
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,000
I do not understand.

167
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,400
Let me know how you czegoœ know.

168
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:01,100
He is not already almost whole day,
where it can be?

169
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,600
Keep it down! These are the sitting do not have to
all will hear a s.

170
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,200
Why are you happy?

171
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,400
Because of something I myself uœwiadomi.
We have a free pass.

172
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,900
- What do you mean?
- Can not you see what should be my dad?

173
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,100
No one will punish the nearest time.

174
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,300
- We are untouchable.
- What do you do?

175
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:24,000
I'm not sure.
This gets a chance once in life.

176
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,600
Must be perfect and great.

177
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:30,500
I want, ¿Eby is shown by all the
principles that guide us in life.

178
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,000
Well, look at that.

179
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,200
- Okay, I do not know what happened the o
- I know that.

180
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,400
Too much of EOE pretend horse riding.

181
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,200
We are good maœæ, Francis.

182
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,200
Lubricates than the groin
and will be as good as new.

183
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,700
It's good stuff, Francis.
I feel a tingling sensation after it.

184
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,200
/ Please call

185
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,900
/ I've seen the EOE Milton?
/ High reward!

186
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,500
- I'm sorry.
- What?

187
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,800
Your posters are distracting people from
my posters, and that were my first.

188
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,700
So what?
It's not your tree.

189
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,400
I am sure that the your dog Milton

190
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,400
s the very sweet and very go
love, but I'm looking for her son.

191
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:57,100
True of a man,
that is missing are the two days ago.

192
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:01,300
Not carefully ck that the exploration of human
are more important than exploration dog?

193
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:04,400
I do not know your kid,
but my parents said,

194
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,400
Also your family is
worth less than my dog.

195
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,900
- What's your first name?
- Patrick.

196
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,100
Patrick, let me tell you something about your dog.

197
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,700
Fled.
Jakaœ it took in another family of a

198
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:23,000
Now the family spoiled him so
much as you will not œni the Father

199
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:27,100
So, your dog already loves
them more than you,

200
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,600
and even how to recover

201
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:31,800
it will be on you with the s,
until they run away again.

202
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:34,100
So, can you take off your posters, OK?

203
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:38,100
Pulling you pull on your posters.
Your kid probably now æpa.

204
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,700
Hey, I'll get the am a little food.

205
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,000
I do not believe that the mieszkaæ I must attic.

206
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,900
¯ c feeds are to remain the oœciami
of czyjegoœ dinner!

207
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,200
Pos you listen to me a minute?

208
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,800
Dad he said, also takes me
and Trish 's Camp.

209
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,400
Do not spend a weekend in one
tent with the women ¹ t!

210
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,000
He provoked it all.

211
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,100
³ He could stop me at the door,
if it wanted to.

212
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:19,800
Malcolm, it seems to me that
I also now you should listen to the statue.

213
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Do you understand?

214
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,900
If I send you listen,
it can come up with the idea jakiœ.

215
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,400
And then gossiped about,
that can help men chose me.

216
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,000
Then can I do the same for you.

217
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,400
We can finally serious n Perform the conversation.

218
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:34,900
No. Behaves as an important mildew,
who wants zaimponowaæ?

219
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,400
- It's over.

220
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,500
D can not take it for much longer.

221
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:43,400
You're the most selfish
and bezmyœln the people are, as the meeting of Am.

222
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:46,000
From now on, I'm not

hoping that please Return to the house, I love you.

238
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:39,400
Dad dug me out of the house,
and Nikki broke up with me of a

239
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,700
I do not know if I'm already here.

Not surprisingly,
Dad also dug me out of the house.
