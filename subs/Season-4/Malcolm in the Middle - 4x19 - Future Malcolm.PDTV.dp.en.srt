00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:08,600
How many are missing the record?

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,400
Two more cans.

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,100
Really there is no record
Jalapeno peppers in food.

But already suffered sufficiently at the.
For a while I tell him.

Seriously, I'll tell him.

We will go to rural area on Saturday,

You have pojechaæ jakieœ 40 km,
¿Eby to have a good view.

15
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,800
It starts at 2 in the morning.

16
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,600
- You can repeat?
- Meteor shower.

17
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,900
He says the that it will be best for 100 years.

18
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:28,000
It sounds scientific.
No, thanks.

19
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:29,700
Come on, Reese,
meteor shower.

20
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:33,300
Fire balls are flying through the air,
fumes smash the ground, just before you are!

21
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,900
- It's not like the appearance of the can.
- We can on jakimœ przejechaæ.

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,800
No, it's going 100 km above the earth!

23
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,700
But it is beautiful and interesting hands.

24
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,500
If Malcolm has of doing this on
jakieœ task for schools were, then we'll go.

25
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,500
This is not to school y

26
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,400
To forget it. You will not be woken up
at 2 am, ¿Eby Daae viewing the stars.

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,200
Bran? Why do you eat? Says Did you come to,
Also tastes like cat food.

28
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,900
I eat it because I must tyæ the crap!

29
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,700
Turns into the huge, a thick cow.

30
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,200
- Not at all.
- Even the doctor so he said.

31
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,400
It œmieszne, now eat for two.
What your doctor does not know?

32
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,800
Hal, he's right.

33
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,700
I'm great!
I do not understand how it's going.

34
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,600
It is believed that am, you're a beautiful
regardless of everything.

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,500
Thank you, darling, you're such a s the sweet.

36
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,100
Do not understand what I'm trying the robiæ anything.

37
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,500
And when you understand the,
This is the œmiej me.

38
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,500
But why should we expect
Also the other bed than the rest of the world?

39
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:33,600
Let's face it.

40
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:37,400
Each on this planet is ridiculous,
tracting scratching the back of the bed, half-grams of pencil.

41
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,700
Back off ... from us.

42
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:44,400
How can the EOE at all pomyœleæ,
Also Niemzowitsch defense Operate on me?

43
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,300
He tried EOE two games ago
and weights of butchered em.

44
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,900
He tried EOE 4 games ago
and weights of butchered em.

45
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Serious does not, as you are
way home in the evenings?

46
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,600
Wait, where are you going? What?

47
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,100
Good!
Who wants zagraæ?

48
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,600
Eddie, come, hitting
same stone in your head.

49
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,700
We will even.

50
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:06,700
No?

51
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:10,600
Chaboo, you can jeœæ
one by hand, the second play.

52
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,700
I do not believe in it.
We are cowards!

53
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,800
Œmieszny Hey kid,
Want to gather in chess?

54
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:19,600
No, thanks.

55
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,200
No. Come on, it's not that hard, look.

56
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,500
This looks as
as the adniutki, little boy.

57
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,900
I know what a jumper.

58
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,700
I know these ¿as skontrowaæ
dribbling Niemzowitsch

59
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,800
without leaving
free way to Bishop.

60
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,800
Your left flank was to a
full of holes as a Swiss cheese.

61
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,800
Hey, I was young champ.

62
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,400
Read it again
chess reference guide.

63
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,700
As soon as the CPI byœ me a runner
¿goodbye after the byœ with aging ¹ and two pawns.

64
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,600
Ok, I understand.
Are you afraid of me!

65
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,800
Yes, I am afraid that the guest of jakiœ
in the park beat me at chess.

66
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,800
Apparently so!

67
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,800
Now, you're wrong the fear of litoœci!

68
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Fear forces us to fight or flee.

69
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:02,200
A litoœæ allows me to flip
and odejœæ, with ¿alem your nieszczêœcia!

70
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,000
/ - I'll kick your rear piece!
- Okay, this fairly.

71
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,800
I was expecting the up ... this.

72
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,800
Nice to, have children ...

73
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,600
Dewey!
What are you doing?

74
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,800
- I paint the wall.
- What's with you?

75
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,800
- Why do the EOE?
- I'm told the child about

76
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:38,000
Child ... the child?

77
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:41,600
Select the color of the ¿.
I've preferred to more bronze brown.

78
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:50,000
Listen to my son, I know that the Worried
birth of a child, but you do not.

79
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,200
Yes, you will not be already najm the younger.

80
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:58,600
It is true that the child we'll be
poœwiêcaæ whole attention regarding the case for some time.

81
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,200
You will need to pomagaæ Find out more at home.

82
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,600
This will probably be
had to dzieliæ bedroom.

83
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,300
My dad is trying to tell, that there is no
¿ebyœ because so perpetuates the!

84
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,100
Now clean up this mess the Taj!

85
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,800
I kid you not talking to you!

86
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,000
He said about that the'd say.

87
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:19,400
Draw.

88
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:23,800
Draw?

89
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,100
Draw!

90
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,700
Draw.

91
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,400
- One more time.
- No!

92
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,100
Gracie ... four ... hours!

93
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,900
Okay, okay.
Bo ¿e

94
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,100
Who designed the these
damn, the cement benches.

95
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:47,900
Probably jakiœ g of stupid clerk
who never finished the architecture.

96
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:51,200
It reflects their frustration
on the back of the hands of the public.

97
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,200
What's wrong with this guy?

98
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:56,500
He's so upset the months. First
heat is on, then too cold.

99
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:00,300
Then go the the eba œmiesznie walking.
Do not close the the even per second!

100
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,400
He could be the spróbowaæ narzekaæ the crap!
You know what the worst part is ...

101
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,600
- 4, 9, 7, 3, 6, 7 ..
- Stop this robiæ.

102
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,600
Sorry.
I'll be back after a few hours.

103
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,600
Wait, where are you going?

104
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,000
He says the am you, poses
the classes of painting.

105
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,600
- Poses? Nudity
- Yes, we talked about it.

106
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,200
No. Always remember
s discussions with the word "nude".

107
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,300
You can not disassemble yourself against Otto.

108
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,400
Not waving tassels
on the catwalk, Francis.

109
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,300
Poses for painters, the work.
P of wages are $ 250.

110
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,200
Piama, I want to Know-,
if I have a good paint.

111
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,800
What color are your nipples?

112
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:41,900
It's very tasteful, which is not
does not matter, because you know what?

113
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,400
This is my body about, so do not
you can speak to me what it robiæ!

114
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,800
If you're not on it sufficient that
were ripe, it's your problem.

115
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,700
$ 250?

116
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:57,700
All that I knew of
On Beauty, was to angle the amstwem.

117
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,000
Morning Dewey wanted to AEOI
the schools were in the briefs,

118
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,300
because the child does not like his clothes.

119
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,300
The kid pushed me to the wall.

120
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,400
And you are still gaining weight, like crazy.
More than a half a kilo a day.

121
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,400
There is not much fatter, it does not make sense.

122
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,500
I know, honey, it's surprising trades,

123
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:20,200
but you skoñczyæ
of t are obsessed about the weight.

124
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,600
- Would you like some juice.
- I do not want the juice, Hal.

125
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,300
I know what's going on!

126
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,600
- Yes?
- Of course, I'm the idiot!

127
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,100
- Sorry, it's ...
- It's because I work there also.

128
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,700
- What?
- It is obvious, Hal.

129
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,700
Æwiczê not enough
as in previous continuous ¿s.

130
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,500
In previous children,
whole day to the bare am on my feet.

131
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:42,300
It makes perfect sense.
Celery?

132
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:49,500
Why this should be so messed up.
The celery taste like bacon!

133
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,000
Baby, Listen to.

134
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:55,200
Do not freak out for a few pounds.

135
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,600
For me, the look you give œwietnie.

136
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:12,200
Not important
how large a and of round and it becomes.

137
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,300
- Hello?
- Part, Mom.

138
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,800
Tell your child
Also have a g the pole bucket of sand,

139
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,700
but buses already ceased to
jeŸdziæ and I can not return to the house.

140
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,300
Dewey?
Where are you?

141
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,200
I do not know exactly.
Somewhere wheel on the pier.

142
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,200
- You're a wheel on the pier?
- Where?

143
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:37,000
Dewey, do not move from there d!
As soon as you come.

144
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,500
Okay, but a pair of przywieŸcie
socks. Drop in the ¹ ³ em in the fish guts.

145
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,600
What is wrong with this child?
Really starts to martwiæ.

146
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:50,600
Calm down, we'll go, we'll buy a pair of
p the donuts and przemyœlimy is on the way.

147
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,500
Again tie?

148
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,600
Casey Kasem, why not wyœwiadczysz
all aperture and services œciszysz this shit!

149
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:05,500
It is not loudly.

150
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,600
He does not speak of I, also is loudly.
I he said that the shit!

151

Right now.
Who are you in the family?

You're a second cousin?
And can the aunt without fifth-staves?

You expect that the game I'll be the
