Not sufficient.

Besides, it's a good opportunity,
to become familiar to the other m dre children.

Listen to Dewey.
We porozmawiaæ.

60
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:28,200
You do bigger, and there are many
cool things about being a large white boy of Caucasian teenage boy.

61
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,300
A big boy the boys do not get in the

You can not speak czegoœ such
just because you're a nervous.

67
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:52,700
I'm sorry, but nothing
can not help the way I feel.

68
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,600
Good night, Dad.

86
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,600
- Too often argue.
- You're right.

87
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:50,200
Why though again we can not be silent
Daae and the time for the mutual continuity me?

88
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,200
Just ...

This whole pretty funny.

159
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:36,100
You're a moron!
Simply, I never want to see you.

160
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,800
As much as the prom.

Come with me.

You see these freaks

It's good.

185

The judges an easily noticeably the Morse code,
So I drew up the basic code of your fingers.

Guys, you will not believe.

191
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,300
Herkabe wants byœmy cheating.

192
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,700
What? This is not allowed!

193
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,400
In precisely. It should not be the
This zapisywaæ.

194
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,900
This is proof in writing.

195
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,400
- Moving into it?
- Malcolm, you do not know what you mean.

196
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,100
It is important for business.
More important, than you think.

197
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,900
More important than you?

198
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,800
So already you know.

199
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,800
You're with us ..
or against ... We?

200
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,800
If it spoil
I'll be had to the Repair the.

201
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,400
Sorry.

202

- Do you work here?
- My dad is the manager.

203
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:55,000
As a bunch of geeks
You make a lot of troubles k.

204
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,200
I do not believe that the is used the EOE
przeciws filter the sunlight.

205
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,200
It's a covered swimming pool.

206
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,600
But we przejœæ
through the garden, there to dotrzeæ.

207
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,900
How can you be in the vicinity of the

and ¿might want adnemu at Insert the?

209
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,600
Believe me,
I did not fit.

210
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,800
Besides, some of them
are my friends of me.

211
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,100
There were two.
No, are still being are.

212
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,700
Just me
it does not rejoice.

213
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,800
What does the byœ if one of your friends the
wanted to do the byœ what robiæ not?

214
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:20,000
- Do not do this of me.
- Yes, but you see, it does not work a

215
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,100
Because in this case
They will do the it anyway.

216
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,800
And it makes me part of a
all of this, regardless of what you will do.

217
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,800
So I do not have outputs.

218
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,600
There are probably jakiœ
too complicated for me to reason, but ...

00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:34,200
you can not just wyjechaæ?

220
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,200

- But ... How are ...
- S ³ Look, Reese.

231
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,600
Some are well-read in the book ¿appropriate,
other deceitful and cunning.

232
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:11,200
I'm afraid you do not also must be Shaken

Do you want to cheat, right?

269
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,900
Since competition is one big deception,
We propose byœmy conned everyone else.

270
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,800
Why do I have to do?

Because you look like the most will give the posi-tion hose

297
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:58,400
