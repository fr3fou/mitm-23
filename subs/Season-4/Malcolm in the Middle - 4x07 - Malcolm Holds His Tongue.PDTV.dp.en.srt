6
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,600
I have this ... fairly.

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:21,800
For me important!

00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,700
, It was possible to get on my second day ¿
provisions, I must utrzymaæ format.

He could of byœ although the spróbowaæ
I lock?

10
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,000
It is continuously too the easy.
Can you exit the ladder?

11
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,600
PREVIOUS please,
You will find us transportation.

12
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,100
Tickets cost were
me $ 40 a piece!

13
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,800
To 2 x 40?

14
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:44,400
Share this by two
and out $ 40 per ticket!

15
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,100
It's not my fault,
Also I can not lead.

16
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,400
But you lose the license EOE!

17
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,300
Because my public defender, did not try the
even defend me, as if one were insane are.

18
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:56,600
It is better to invent something, because if not we'll be
dojechaæ could go, it will not go!

19
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,400
Never arrange to
with someone m³ drzejszym from you.

20
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:04,200
Okay, break's over.
We're going back to work.

21
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,200
Going on the circuit.
Practice your dribbling.

22
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,000
And this time not siedŸ idle
try the goat of the five owaæ tablespoon all around the a

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,200
My ... b of the d

24
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,300
Sorry.

25
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,600
I know that a little crazy,
but for the first time in life

26
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:21,000
I'll be doing of something, what
depends on normal people.

27
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:23,200
Being in the second ¿flows, the best
happens to me of the in life.

28
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,700
And I do not want to zawaliæ.

29
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,300
I'm just saying that if the we
wygraæ and how are money, we want to.

30
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,400
Looks as this, that we should
large with more postawiæ on the offensive.

31
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,900
I do not think I'm the only
the audience, who are today,

32
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,400
Also is something completely
wrong with your tactics are the game.

33
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,200
If you think about the second,

34
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,400
uœwiadomisz themselves also need to
enter some changes.

35
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,700
What the hell is with me do not you?

36
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,100
Why can not I shut the!

37
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:49,000
We are ... the same.

38
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:56,400
We're talking ... before ... pomyœlimy.

39
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,400
/ Malcolm!

40
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,100
How many times do I have to repeat, ¿ebyœ
putting up the wet towel after use!

41
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,200
/ Is it so difficult?

42
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,500
If so, can you just
throw out your towel.

43
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,100
Next time, after a shower prevents
the podwóku until dry.

44
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,900
/ Gee, Mom, or garden front of the house
/ There was to be more humiliating the months?

45
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,600
- I'm sorry.
- I do not want listen to ....

46
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,200
- You said what?
- I'm sorry.

47
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,800
Yes. So ...

48
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,200
I can see that the boys are learning the boys.

49
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,500
So can it not the best
time for such a conversation.

50
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,000
You want something to drink, or whatever?

51
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,300
Definitely like
you a birthday present?

52
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,600
Dad, boots are perfect,
exactly like I wanted to.

53
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,400
Listen to S that were really expensive,
Very well care for them, okay?

54
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,800
I'll be. Do not worry.
Once again, big thanks Dad!

55
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,300
- What the hell are you doing?
- Piama, an old cowboy trick.

56
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,900
Immersed in water shoes
and does not even take off their per minute,

57
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,600
time until the entire kowitego dry.

58
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,400
Even if it will take a few days.
As you finish, matching the like gloves.

59
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,300
Appearance can drastically
but believe me, I know what I'm doing.

60
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,800
These are the shoes for $ 300,
which is precisely destroy the EOE.

61
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,800
Nothing will destroy the em
so should robiæ!

62
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,600
You've got to zaufaæ on this issue!

63
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,300
Why do you always talk
to me, as the idiot.

64
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,100
And all of the hand of the rabbit
¿Lived long and szczêœliwie.

65
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,400
A mora of this tale is that, son

66
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,900
Also knows the yellow plant are the amanymi rascals
which will not give the his of gold.

67
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,000
Sure.

68
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,400
Dad?

69
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:59,600
It's like watching the course of the gods
returning the smokers of the Games.

70
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,200
- Part! Hello! Sorry.
- Part.

71
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,800
- What's it called?
- Walk sports.

72
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,400
I've never seen the czegoœ I like that.

73
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,600
The style, the grace.

74
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,900
It's not just about the good appearance.

75
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,300
This is the best low-æwiczenie
intensity that wymyœlono.

76
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,000
Contrary to what you are saying
All gogusie of Tai-Chi.

77
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,800
Yes, but how is it done?

78
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,200
The International Federation of
chodziarstwa determine the a,

79
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,400
Also one foot always
must stykaæ out of the ground the.

80
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,800
A leg remain across the back of the
must be straight at the knee.

81
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,200
- Something like that?
- Hey, I think for the catch of EOE.

82
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,600
Look at this,
I think there is a natural talent.

83
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,400
Look at me!

84
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,200
I can walk perfectly!

85
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,700
I am the venom of the lunch
the elderly and to me, Carl,

86
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,600
completely on me and the furious,
Cody j because of the cast.

87
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:53,400
I mean, I know them the am with each other,
but if it makes me the responsibilit?

88
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,000
/ Why are you asking me?
/ I do not even know these people.

89
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,700
I know, I know. Know how to
postawiæ in her situation.

90
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,500
But she just
Wrzeszcz me of a

91
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,900
Now I feel this poorly,
because it is the semi-aka a

92
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,200
And the crap I can not myœleæ,
or do something completely ³ ³ am not poorly?

93
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,000
/ Completely I do not care.

94
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,700
/ My parents can
/ Wróciæ at any time,

95
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,000
/ We can start the æ could to owaæ,
/ So we have time?

96
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,800
Malcolm, thank you very much.

/ I must just Hold the language for

101
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,100
Dad, please. The concert is on Saturday
evening, you need transportation?

102
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,200
Reese, no!

103
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,600
Your mom goes to work,
and my car is in the shop.

104
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:42,000
You znaleŸæ yourself someone else.
Are my hips are equal?

105
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,400
Look at the back of my books when I go.

106
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:48,000
Dad, I swear, I also do not like me
You confirm, that leaves the house forever!

107
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,100
Or never be output.

108
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,100
Whatever is worse.
It's your choice, buddy.

109
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,500
- I think that you will smakowaæ.
- Yes, yes, I understand.

110
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,900
In the deposit ê it in your mouth, your nails
from the tap my foot between his teeth,

111
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,400
Spit everything, and you
will be had of it on tape.

112
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,500
- It's already to the Father
- I'm sorry for that.

113
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,900
But both very
dojrzeliœmy since then.

114
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,600
I have a proposal, which the
you can considered as a c are interesting.

115
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,600
You are still a warm e

116
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,800
Now, I know that the one
coolest guy like you

117
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,400
not returned the
g half of such cases.

118
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,100
This note's easy to use.
Anyway the and so you're probably busy.

119
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,400
- What are you talking about?
- In the background is the Saturday concert.

120
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,300
Together with Alison zastanawialiœmy
or not wanted to byœ AEOI.

121
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,200
¿Do you want the ebym gone
with you to the concert?

122
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,600
Yes, more or less.

123
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,800
But the coolest ever
is get there and back.

124
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,800
¿But yet I must not speak to you about it.

125
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,500
Let's look at who I'm talking.

126
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,000
Single, in the medium age
cy have lived with a cat.

127
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,100
You Know-all
Planning dating.

128
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,800
Clear that I know a lot but ...

129
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:53,200
Probably did not even get excited
up to mind the true date.

130
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,900
This is not something about which
b begged byœ weeks.

131
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,800
Of course, also not
Who would have took over the.

132
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:01,700
But if people are pytaæ bed,
it does not forbid me opowiadaæ?

133
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,300
No problem.
Will œwietnie.

134
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,100
And I'll Such use opowiadaæ people, right?

135
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,100
Howdy all.

136
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,600
I must tell you, Hal.

137
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:16,100
I've never seen the am, ¿Eby someone
for the catch of the sport as soon as you.

138
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,500
How much of a mine - 3 days?

139
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,000
/ And you're already on my level.

140
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,300
¿It is not yet a rivalry.
After ¿wyœcig not, right?

141
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,900
It's only a matter of time
as you will be surrounded.

142
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,700
We send The message to the command,

143
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,400
but every ¿The message will
Radio will be captured.

144
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:39,000
Do you think that the do not know that?
Pos ³ ³ em and when we are the secret weapon.

145
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,800
The Lord calls you, sir?

146
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:50,900
Corporal, I do not think I need to speak,
Also the fate of the entire free world depends on you.

147
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,100
I deliver the message
to headquarters before morning.

148
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,200
My God, is 100 km from here the d

Some of the shorts,

So everything is all right,

Billy spits Varagaskin
3 feet away from me.

253
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:00,600
I accept it!
Why do not you can?

254
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,500
Dewey may have been right.

Can not zes of God and of me on the ground,
¿Eby pobiæ the guest's, but look at him.

256

Perfect posture,
perfect rotation of the hips.

257
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,000
Wait a minute ...

258
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,600
Two feet without contact
from the ground at the same time!

259
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,500
Dewey!
Do you see it?

260
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:25,600
This air.

You're a smug!

263
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,700
As Janet also got the a
T-shirt for my last wyœcig.

264
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,100
It is believed that am that it will be fairly
Daae you girl my socks.

265
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,100
Oh, my God also?

266
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,400
I'm sorry that the interrupt Wheeler

Also, avoid using can fail napatrzeæ
on the back of my body a

270
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,300
It will not take long.

271
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,600
And one has a note of.

272
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:57,500
This time, ¿Eby was to
otherwise, try to AEOI.

273
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,200
What are you talking about?

274
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,200
Thinking of EOE, also finds no
your of a small, dirty secret?

275
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:07,400
This clever jump executed
every fourth step masks the ascent.

276
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,200
You can not fool the recording.

277
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,300
Tape sees everything,
And I see everything on it.

278
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,800
None of you walker.
You're just ordinary white runner.

279
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,400
It is completely of no ...

280
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,200
Do not worry.
Catch up with him.

281
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,400
1, 2, 3, is!
1, 2, 3, is! 1, 2, 3, is!

282
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,400
And when I had the 14 years,
I got the first are the velor shirt.

283
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,800
That day everything changes the Father

284
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,300
Suddenly he opened the club atronomów.

285
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,800
People began to sit down
on my side of the bus.

286
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,900
But I'm a Libra, so
myœleæ she likes best about people.

287
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,600
Listen to Craig says in precisely the em
Alison as the focus on driving.

288
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,300
No, that's precisely the EOE says that the I
I do love of me and made it possible for you ...

289
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,400
Do you like long-long walks on the beach Communal?

290
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,700
I've always liked to.

291
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,400
Besides, I am
grandmaster in the game ships.

292
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,500
I have a cap if you'd want to view a.

293
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,200
So Ali, you jakieœ siblings?

294
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,600
What are you doing?

295
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,000
Do not talk with me,
only could to APPROACH?

296
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,600
I am part of the owiekiem and deserves
For a bit of conversation and companionship

297
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,000
before a whole sawing.

298
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,800
I do not mind the about me when 2 times
stop the sure that the change Eby shirt.

299
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,700
But I do not think,
Also should krzyczeæ me.

300
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,400
