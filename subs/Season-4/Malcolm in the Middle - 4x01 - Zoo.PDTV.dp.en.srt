00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:27,100
It's not even funny.

The last time I'm talking to you:
Get up at the moment.

Honey, it's just a phase.

18
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,200
Each teenager goes through this.

19
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,600
Me and my father also.

20
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,100

Reese does not come out of the dryer.

22
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:46,200
It's a difficult, painful,
and it seems that that will never end.

23

Now get out of of bed!

You know, son. I do not like

Let me tell you something.
Can you buy the wax figure of a crocodile?

67
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,300
We can view the tiger?

00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:50,700
No.

75
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,600
And since it was committed ¿half of EOE

78
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,700
First, let's see all the animals,

79
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,200
and then decide,
we will see it again.

You're here wróciæ the fifth of the!

Still the ¿¿'re alive in a child
world of dreams.

89
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,800
You do not realize,
You're a slightly CYM the dust quite

90
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:25,100
lost in some foreign insensitive wszechœwiecie
NYM full of random tragedy.

91
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:28,000
What is a lemur?

92
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,400
There is Matt. Part, Matt!

93
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,800

Fine the zoo that you have here.

97
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,900
I must admit,
Also exciting for us the day months.

98
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,200
I do not often have the opportunity to
spêdziæ time with your family.

99
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,200
You know how it is - work, work, work!

00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,100
But he says the c truth,
This g of mostly wine boss.

But I have a feeling
Also will soon be on the chopping block.

103
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:58,600
At least that's
Jimbo operates in the marketing.

104
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,500
Good to Know-Yes, Matt.

105

He knew pm, also will address the
somehow something like that.

106

I always had the EOE so cute animals.

-Looking as I am.

115
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,600
¿And what is this little one?

116
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,400
Want some?

117
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,300
Too slow.

118
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,900
Be careful what you do.

119
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,800
That was your big b ³ ¹ d ¿ko wheel!

120

Do you want to solo?
No problem.

00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:53,600

He began ¹ ³.

123

Goats do not hook the people.

124

Get out.

125
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,900
Guess what I'll do.

126
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,200
Leave.

127
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,200
If we'll be pchaæ car
until we find a mechanic

128
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,800
we'll be able to pay the ACIA

No, no! Buy lottery tickets.

00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:21,100
This is exactly the moment
Fortunately up when s smile.

134
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:24,200
Baby, do not we spend our
last five dollars on lotteries.

135
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,500
It's madness.

136
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,000
Now I'll go and buy food.

137
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,400
As they eat the Doroo.

138
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,900
It is no wonder that the Blue Book
values ??are less than a photo on the e three thousands of hands.

139
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000

and buried in a hidden basement?

177
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,700
No.

178
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,900

Okay, buy the lottery tickets am.

This can not I

00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,800
By making you feel more despicable.

00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,600
How else ever
Such use would be szczêœliwy?

189
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,500

Where are they?
They're not here.

196
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,600
What a racket!

Closed are the only thing I dream of EOE.

199
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:28,900
You are also at the bottom.

200
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,300
And may never be the deposit any tigers,

201

This often has to operate normally
in the rain forest.

210

He wanted to become familiar byœ the next
Friend of the rainforest?

217
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,600
I do not know.
Animals can sprowadziæ rain.

218
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,000
So we have to poœpieszyæ.

219

245
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,500
Do not move, do not move ...

246
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,100
You say that the 20 minutes.

247

Let us be of a lady
tell to someone, we are also here?

255
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,200
For me the continuity's sake!

256
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,400
I do not think that these kids
should there be.

257
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,700
Emancipate us out error!

258
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,500
Well, well ...

Æwiczyliœmy the event of such a situation
and are suitable for this procedure.

What is the limit

262
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:00,300
No, the article in the press must brzmieæ

We saw already koalas?

Well, let's see how it looks as.

268

How is it?

269
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,600
Much better.

270

Ceased with the æ leaking.

Can the rest?

275
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:30,200
Hal ...

276
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,400
Do not know what to tell.

277
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,400
I feel terrible
because of what happened the o

278
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,500
Really?

279
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,300
Of course, also like that.

280
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,100
Come on.

281
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:40,800
These are the I think that we both know that the wearing of EOE trauma,
I selected the Lois and me instead of you.

282
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:43,400
Lois selected the a ..
Wait, so in precisely do you think?

283
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,900
I only hope that he said that I
with a sense of, I do not feel one's own face

284
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,400
Hal, it's not completely the wrong.

285
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,100
There was to were I with you.

286
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,800
This whole situation is that of a while for me
unbearable, so I withdrew em.

287
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,400
What?

288
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,600
I mean, Lois is œwietna,

289
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:59,400
but I wanted to it over the switched cznoœæ,
to which she does not agree of a

290
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,900
I did not know of, or in the weekend
will be with me, you are, and Dennis ...

291
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Dennis? What Dennis?

292
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,200
None.

293
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:13,300
I must AEOI.

294
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:21,200
20 minutes ago I was worried about the up
Which of us eat a tiger.

295
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:24,400
Now I can not relaxing to use.

296
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,100
All right, kids. Tigers were not reacted
to cast our steaks.

297
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:38,500
The thing is that the prefer to you,
because we are ¿feeds as their natural prey.

298
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,700
As soon as you say "but," right?

299
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:43,000
So ... No.

300
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,900
But we have everything under control.

301
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,500
Wanna shoot tigers arrows
with the center calming agent.

302
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,000
How much will it take before they start the activity of AAE?

303
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,200
Less than two minutes.

304
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:55,100
Sufficient as long,
to were you can Insert at us?

305
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,100
Wait a minute.

306
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,100
Okay, these people are idiots.

307
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,500
Malcolm, everything will be fine.

308
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,800
Yes, Dewey.
These are ¿I hope so, but ...

309
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:05,400
No I'm talking about hope.
I know that nothing we will not.

310
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,500
You can not the Know-.

311
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,300
In precisely that the I can.

312
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,400
You can not.

313
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,700
In precisely that the so.

314
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,400
Really. I know that all
will be fine.

315
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,000
Hang on for another few minutes.

316
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,500
The Ponoæ had a similar
situation in the District of Columbia.

317

And this will be your office.

344

You have a long-pens in one drawer,
and paper in the other.

345

Initially, it stores a ³ em

Okay, Listen to, because he probably
for 30 seconds you know it yourself.

357
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,800
I'm not really a cowboy.

358

Not even my name is Zeke only Murray
and sure as hell do not know what I'm doing here.

359

You have no idea?

360
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,500
In life there I worked on a ranch.

361
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,100
Really?

362
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:19,400
Yes. Never would I in the vicinity of such
which has not thrown æwierædolarówki.

363
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,800
It's great.

Listen to S will hit the EOE here ¿s ³ ê of gold.

365
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,600

Appear to whole quite nice.

Mili is to defective Specify the.

368
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,100
You do not even lift a finger ¹ æ
and they and the bed so you are semi-latin.

369
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:31,900
¯ Are you kidding me?

370
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,200
I'm telling you that the only thing we have to robiæ
This pilnowaæ each other,

371
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,500
and we can wydoiæ people
the last cent.

372
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,400
What do you think?

373
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:42,900
I think that you're fired.

374
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,400
Now, if you forgive,

375
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:49,200
I will go to convince themselves,
whether it's for me or for the horse.

376
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,400
With the break Did you come to a promise!

377
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,000
What promise?

378
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,500
¿Do not we had any.

379
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,600
That was a mutual understanding!

380
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,800
At least on my part!

381
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,200
You're exaggerating with the reaction.

382
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,000
It's the am with a couple of guys,
We met when he.

383
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,200
How does the find the difference?

384
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,400
A few?
How many of them was to, Lois?

385
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,400
Do not you understand?
It does not matter.

386
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,900
You win the EOE.
It's already past continuity, the end.

387
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:11,000
Your promise ring
it is not the memory of the tk are a family.

388
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,100
What?

389
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,000
Ok I of the break you.
³ I bought it.

390
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:18,000
- So go buy the EOE.
- For someone else.

391
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,400
Someone else?

392
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,100
Sorry.

393
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,100
I hold the secret to
for so many years.

394
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,600
It did not dawa of the peace.

395
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:28,400
³ I always knew that the supposed
tell you, but I did not know the how.

396
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,900
Who was to?

397
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Farrah Fawcett.

398
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,000
I had the Fifteen years.

399
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,600
He knew I was, also a lot of guys
with her love of the,

400
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:42,000
but I was thinking of that if the hands her the ring
¿if not distinguished from the rest of those idiots.

401
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:46,400
I'm sorry that the earlier
you do not he said I was.

402
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:50,500
Can you just let us recognize,
That we are even.

403
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,100
Hey, Randy, this is Bill.

404
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,200
These two little ones are still being is
trapped on the catwalk tigers?

405
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,500
Let's all calm down the.

406
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:01,800
Coincidentally, I answer the information
of obwoŸnego.

407
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,200
Reese and Malcolm?

408
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,200
Malcolm and Dewey.

409
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,800
Reese has not survived to 30 seconds.

410
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,900
I think Stanley back starting with the oœciæ.

411
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,400
EOE give them the names?

412
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,700
This Stanley.

414
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,400

I love you.

416
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,900
Do not say that!

417
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:21,400
This is true.

418
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,400
We love you too.

419
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,700
You say that I carefully ck,
Also killed.

420
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,800
It's part of your
hatred for life.

421
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,500
You are wrong. I love the force.

422
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,100
Now that the uœwiadomi of em.

423
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,800
It is not perfect,
but it also contains the love.

424
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:34,500
I love mum and dad,
Francis and even Reese.

425
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:35,400
I love you all.

426
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,300
Stop it. We'll be fine.

427
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,600
Why do not you stop, Dewey?

428
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,100
Why do not you stop pretend,
Also everything is great

429
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:41,600
and do not say that the love me?

430
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,100
Do not die!

431
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,300
In precisely that the so!
're Going to die!

432
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,600
This is the ultimate proof
Also all the time I had the right!

433
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,300
I do not need any g ¿the child play the fool
Give the fold of lying to me the false hope.

434
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:56,200
You do not need any mazgajowatego brother ¿
perishable lying the whole use these brand being in a zoo.

435
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,600
Oh, my God also?

436
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,100
Just're in with the white spirits.

437
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:00,600
We'll go with that.

438
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,400
Wrong.

439
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,100
Admit it, Dewey.

440
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:06,200
Superman did not arrive here
and will not save us.

441
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:13,400
Straight in the face, kozo.
And who now œmieje?

442
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:25,000
Since the trip to the zoo,
³ I now get a lesson from the life.

443
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,000
It's amazing that the something as simple
almost like being eaten by tigers

444
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,200
puts everything in a new light.

445
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:33,500
It's just great that the
szczêœliwym be again.

446
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:37,400
Of course, you always have to
This uczyæ the hard way?

447
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,100
No one else so no.

448
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:43,300
Why is the universe believes that that the needs almost
zabiæ me to it until he reached me of the?

449
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,800
My life sucks.

450
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:45,800
Go To of bed.

451
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,100
No, Francis.
Everything good in the deposit of about s

452
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,200
Zgodziliœmy will not pozywaæ them

453
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,700
and they agreed to
Reese wsadzaæ not in jail.

454
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,800
Simply already know.
Tell me about your new job.

455
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:56,400
It is of a great
So many already taught em up.

456
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,800
By the way, when we were at the zoo

457
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,600
will not happen to you on the widzieæ
jakiegoœ birth animal?

458
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,800
No. A what?

459
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:05,200
Just out of curiosity.
AD invalid.

460
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:08,900
Already almost done, baby.

461
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:12,000
Push the last time.
