Please.
It's completely overcooked.

13
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,300
I think I already did not have long EOE
in the mouth of a good meal the bed.

No, Hal.
Find out what he wants.

20
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:45,000
How are you will hear?

21
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,200
This week on the occasion of
Birthday Dad's family reunion.

22
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:50,800
I'm sorry, Claire, but soon I had the
the operation rate, so do not zjawimy.

23
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:54,000
No, Hal. Too long us to the Father
We should jechaæ.

24
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,000
But you know what?
My foot feels much better already.

25
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,100
So am cancels this treatment,
and we'll see on Saturday.

26
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,700
Wait a minute. Invite us for the two days
before the ceremony? Forget it, Hal.

27
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,300
We are not welcome there.

28
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,200
But with the feet
you never know.

29
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,600
And therefore we should precisely jechaæ there.

30
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:10,200
What am I talking about?
Already I had the foot of the operated.

See you on Saturday.

00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,000
What is the grandfather?

33
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,500
It's cool, but the rest of the family dad
treats my mother like garbage; bunch of matt s.

34
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:24,300
Rich mato were, and his grandfather is
the richest of them all.

35
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,400
I love children. Say what you say
and we'll be lined up for an entire force.

36
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,300

The van was not the draft

00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,500
Great. Zero boredom.

It's a fascinating hands busy.

Use of the tool we use to
called burdizzo.

52
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,900
It looks as a couple
huge claws,

53
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:07,700
and the bull must be immobilized,
so as not to kick the the ...

Nonsense. Look at the sweat stains
Lois on clothing.

78
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,100
It seems that part of the family,
I never watch the ladies.

Meanwhile babia that it

Well, yes.

00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,400
I do not know. History?

109
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,600
And so history?

110
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,000
What do you think of the Civil War?

111

It is fairly interesting ca.

112

116
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:10,800
I swear that the cricket tournament on Tuesday

122
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,100
It's all right, Hal.

123
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:34,600
At the moment, give him his shorts!

124
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,600
You're the only grandson,

Super.

127
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,100
Do not pay any attention to it.

128
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,700
Do not waste your time on a pile of guns.

Noticed that the EOE something?

133
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,900
Yes. The numbers at the top that were not added.

134
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,100
What?

135
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,500
In this column.

136
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:08,300
The numbers are rising in until 1286,
but the sum of the bottom is 1179.

137
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,100
I had the hope that
Also notice about how looks as $ ',

- Have you seen the EOE somewhere cookies?
- We porozmawiaæ.

154
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,400
It's about Lois.

155

Ever since d here we are,
Each family is on each occasion ...

Honey?

313
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,800
Honey ...

314
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,200
Bo ¿e ..

315
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,500
Is Lois also help with are the atce?

316
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:39,100
About Bo ¿e More
sadness for this woman.

317
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,200
What are you going?

318
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,700
We do not know.
We do not know.

319
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,700
Hal ... What are you doing?

320
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,800
I defend my dignity.

321
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,300
This led to me hello, Dad.

322
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:05,800
My wife semi-crying at the top because of this,
j are treated as the family,

323
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,500
And it must skoñczyæ.

324
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:12,000
Someone here is depressed.

325
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,600
Never put a frontal
real problems, right?

326
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,400
Just you think,
That if the poœmiejesz up, go away the same.

327
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,100
Do not you see?

328
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,800
For the entire e my life,
EOE does not pay the attention to me

329
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,500
whenever I pass the
through a difficult period.

330
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,900
This already exceeds
przyzwoitoœci boundaries.

331
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,800
It never helped to EOE,
and when I throw the girl,

332
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,500
when zdech of my dog,

333
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,900
when my best friend
the conduct in

334
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,700
when the supply of the I wciry in school,

335
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:39,000
the flow of em aka the entire summer
do not even know why the c!

336
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:39,900
Come on, Hal!

337
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,100
And it helped to EOE me when the family
notoriously torments of the wife and me,

338
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:48,400
so, also I had to avoid them
her and you!

339
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:55,400
For Fifteen years, I had no father,
because nothing will engage ¿half of EoE!

340
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:04,400
Okay, I will throw it out of the home.

341
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,600
I hope that to you, he reached the Father

342
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:10,600
I love you, Dad.

343
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,100
I'll get you a towel.

344
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:20,700
One of those old, please.

345
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,800
Everybody ready?

346
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:26,900
He was born I was READY.

347
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,100
Cake!
Trolley!

348
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:27,200
We had to fast from there d Remove patient
for your safety.

349
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,400
That was the unbelievable.

350
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:32,200
Przejechaliœmy three crossings,
Aunt Claire puœci him and in the end of the handle.

351
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,100
We all rozczarowaliœcie me.

352
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:40,000
I do not care what they did to these people,
Such behavior is not fitting.

353
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:40,800
Right, Hal?

354
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,500
In precisely. I warn you.

355
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:47,400
If ever you access a wheelchair
on the set with table and into the pool ...

356
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:51,300
The sprinkle of punishment.
The terrible punishment.

357
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:54,500
I guess I ¿egnaliœmy up with the szeœciocyfrow
sum of money from the trust fund.

358
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,600
I said the grandfather,
Also attaches for me hello to the truck.

359
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,400
What!

360
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,200
Are still being like you.

361
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,000
NieŸle. We return to the game.

362
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,600
In precisely.

363
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:09,300
Do not blow you too much?

364
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,300
No.

00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
