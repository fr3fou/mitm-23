Thanks, the trick with the credit cards are
takes hours.

00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,100
Why do you need zabieraæ

10
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,800

I want to Eby ¿³ of comfort.

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,600
So what am I supposed to in the Chaa,
when will you be?

12
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:01,800
Your doctor will prescribe the mother, ¿Eby and hold the up
my sister for some time.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,900
Dad back starting przyzwyczajaæ.
Now at least semi-AkAA walk perfectly well to the garage u

14
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,600
No washers.
Take a look at the trace.

15
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,200
In precisely why I have to
wyprowadziæ of this house.

16
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:18,400
For each time when destroying furniture
do not use the c washers, what causes it?

17
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,500
Killing a child.

18
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,700
You kill a child.

19
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:27,400
For each time as running the house,
whenever they are destroying furniture,

20
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,700
for each time when
roll fights with each other,

21
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,400
killing a child.

22
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,700
Lois, the doctor he said.
Powinnaœ also not up denerwowaæ.

23
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:38,400
What is a simple proof
Also for every time when they behave poorly,

24
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,900
as if we were to pull out the gnêli feet in
and drove it in a little child's heart.

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
You can the crap is to repeat?

26
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,600
I hope that you have
healthy enough conscience,

27
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,200
Also commute guilt,
that we should feel,

28
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:50,800
in better behavior,
when I will not.

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,600
Sorry.

30
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,100
Oh, I do not know how long

31
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,800
Just a few days and leave.

32
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,500
We can have what we want,
when it starts to podjeŸdzie cofaæ.

33
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,600
In fact
do not hurt the child, right?

34
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,100
Week before you were born

35

to her car when howling ¿d ¿and of the work.

36
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,200
I just want to retain the face.

37
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:13,500
Do not admit sure that the will of the
We are wykurzyæ her home.

38
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,700
Now we'll TODAY government.

00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,200
No?

42
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:30,500
How can you not lubiæ cheese?
It's made of czegoœ that comes from you.

43
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,100
Part, Otto.

44
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,000
I did not see the EOE can
squeak toys are more Helga?

45
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,600
It's the one that looks as
as it were fire hydrant.

46
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,400
No, but I facilitated the
przypalacz new marking.

47
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,000
Want wystraszyæ
poor thing to death?

48
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:47,300
Otto, I know how much you love Helga,
but we have of doing this.

49
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,400
All cows must
zostaæ marked and dewormed.

50
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,300
I promise that the I would be very careful ny.

51
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,300
But she's not talk about it.

52
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,200
You know, it is not
so be brave, for the appearance as possible.

53
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,800
Once I spoke in her
one of the terrible the History of the fire,

54
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:05,500
and had to break loose between me and the
and Gretchen for a week.

55
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,000
I like the the
movements in the elbows, which will add the EOE.

56
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,400
Where it podpatrzy of EoE?

57
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,200
You got me there.
I'm just a wave.

58
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,800
Okay, okay, we can already
return to work?

59
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,300
After ¿was to sensational.

60
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,000
Is that enough of a sensational,
¿Eby is likely to occur on the scene,

61
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,400
Daae show and dinner
for the founders club "Elks"?

62
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,400
You said what?

63
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,900
I can not of themselves doczekaæ,
to tell you.

64
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,200
We've screwed the game!

65
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,300
It is no longer possible.

66
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,400
Not taking anyone
new years.

67
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,400
£ easier dostaæ new heart,
zagraæ than this club.

68
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,500
I know, but this morning at a gas station
I met Eddie the Eigen,

69
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:00,600
³ walked up to me, ¿Eby up przywitaæ
and poœlizgn are on the oil patch.

70
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,400
There may exist.

71
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,000
¯ kidding.

72
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,700
I'm talking to you, as if God wanted to,
Eby ¿³ test drove the van on his hands.

73
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:11,000
Eddie is used of my cell phone,
¿Eby AAE cancels his performance.

74
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,900
Two minutes later,
I will do the "choose again"

75
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:16,400
and I screwed us on the show.

76
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,400
/ I can not uwierzyæ,
/ Also do not trust me, Dad.

77
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,800
/ You do not see Malcolm.

78
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,100
/ Even though it does not like,
/ I am not talked to him over the month.

79
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,400
Nickie is able to hack the right angle.

80
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,700
And that's good, right?

81
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:37,000
But with him a jerk, I can not uwierzyæ,
Also forces us to meetings in the dressing room.

82
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,600
As soon as my mom leaves,
spotykaæ we could get in my house.

83
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,800
Thanks to God,
Here there is no peace.

84
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:49,400
- To the EOE with t the girls are!

Her name is Nicki
and you do not see with her are.

89
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,400
For each time,
when I'm about the collapses,

90
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,100
so as if you kick the tiny grave.

91
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:08,100
Not about the refracting you.

92
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,200
Part mom, part dad.

93
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:14,000
You know, Mom, charming appearance today give.

94
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,400
People do not appreciate the how delightfully
you can look the Daae in the correct light of.

95
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,800
I always tell the kids at school,
You're a mother are the most wonderful.

96
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,600
- Add the water supply for coffee.
- It Henson, the soluble do.

97
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,800
/ Day of the wiêŸniami?

98
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:30,000
We have no choice. In this situation
will not leave you alone with Reese.

99
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,800
- This is just plain awful.
- And that's it.

100
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,300
Take him to jail,
some criminals yell at him,

101
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,200
and come home spokornia the y

102
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,900
Hey, in the package is the rock gear.

103
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,500
Well, the angle of opocie, Helga.
Almost skoñczyliœmy.

104
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:49,300
- How are you doing?
- End already deworming.

105
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,200
God, what a stench.

106
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,800
- Okay, let's get this already with g halfway.
- Wait a minute, is not it EoE marking the first?

107
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:58,600
No, and why?

108
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,200
This may be the prime reason g.

109
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,000
Dinner for the founders.

110
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,400
For equal to 3 hours
We will sing on the stage.

111
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,900
The dessert section.
Better can not be the Father

112
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,400
Clear that not.
It's a great moment.

113
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,600
Dewey, I have to skupiæ,

So I want ebyœ ¿³ sat here
and watch the da of the peace.

115
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,700
Why I must be here,
Why can not I jechaæ on a snowboard with Reese?

116
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,000
Reese jeŸdzi
snowboarding.

117
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,800
It's just a lie,
which wymyœli the daddy of the mother.

118
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:24,900
Reese is in prison.

119
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:28,400
- For how long?
- A few hours.

120
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:35,600
If not, and you found the declines all contraband,
You can store probably already to become familiar some prisoners.

121
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,400
This is Samuel

122
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,600
He said what I sitting here,
but it is against the law,

123
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,500
speak of those persons not properly ¿nionym.

124
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Wait a minute.

125
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:57,600
There was to zapinaæ needs so tight.

126
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:07,500
No good.
We must be explained by a couple of things.

127
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:12,800
It should be life for me.
We are mine are the property of their.

128
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:17,500
We should Know-,
I also do not care about your stuff.

129
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,900
Stand up.

130
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
He said I get up!

131
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,900
Rotate up!

132
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,700

Sit down!

136
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,800
See how does it work?

137
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,800
Because in prison have
wymyœlaæ themselves entertained.

138
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,300
And when the toss here
BANDA szczylów like you ...

00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,500
- Do you think that the this is funny?
- I was thinking of that the had of the be.

144
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,900
So we have a new Wimpy Kid?

Well even if it is overloaded
it's not about who is where.

157
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:52,800
The question is, what is

00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:41,100
It is whole quite differently when they experience
this on one's own skin.

173
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,600
Mom, come on.

174
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,100
I'll do anything you ask,

Helga, my beloved.

211
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:53,000
This whole fucking ripped that tough,
leads precisely to that!

212
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,400
It ...

213
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,400
Are you are listening to what I'm saying?

214
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,200

What I would have had the
obawiaæ of you?

218
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:12,400
Because taking any continuously at such antics
likely to have finished at this point.

219
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,100
And when that happens ...

220
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,400
You know Sammy ...

221
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:21,600
Such use by someone you przemyciæ

00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:37,400
Stretching the gniesz his hand on the 70 miles
behind bars, until my house?

226
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,300
And then the absence of sperm
nab a member of the uterus starts off with the uszczaæ,

227
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,000
which results in a month meal.

228
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,800
The woman is very sensitive longer possible
emotionally at this time,

229
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,900
but God help you weapons
przypominaæ her about it,

230
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:51,000
because then you will be
had the two problems ...

231
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,400
I hope you do not
will stress too much.

232
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:00,100
Kitty and I will buy the new anti-perspirant,
and I do not trust him.

233
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,500
There would not even have noticed that the,
I also sweat,

234
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,300
if I'm still banned
on the back of the all the time.

235
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,200
I am so
At any song, you know?

236
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,400
Honestly said the c, not carefully am,
¿Eby it was to fair.

237
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,000
¿After all przystaliœmy
on the layout of the ad, Hal.

238
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,200
From where they now these claims?

239
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:16,200
From the back of the, this is the d sk

240
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:20,600
You were such a wonderful g ³ os
you never sang as a leader?

241
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:21,800
I do not know.

242
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,300
They told me that a little
Screech on high tones.

243
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,800
That you're a leader?

244
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:31,100
There is no leader, we take
All decisions as a group.

245
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,500
¿I do not remember any voting
of these sweaters.

246
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,600
¿After all zgodziliœmy up
these sweaters.

247
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,300
You are like those sweaters, right?

248
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,100
Of course.

249
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,200
What does he have tell?

250
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:44,400
"As a brother, I'll be first in the group,
to draw attention to the ugly sweaters "?

251
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,900
Dewey, what are you think of these sweaters?

252
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,400
Like the to me that are œmieszne.

253
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,800
See? We will now
appearance gave absurd.

254
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,800
But it does not matter
I like the appearance of the dam,

255
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,800
and so no one will
Such use my notes to use.

256
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,300
For me the continuity Bosk ...

257
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:59,400
Can if we were more
worried g of hair and less sweaters.

258
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,400
Now there is something wrong with my œpiewaniem?

259
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,200
Placed at least tell
Your first name without changing the pitch.

260
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,000
I am carefully that the Malik sings beautifully.

261
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,400
Of course, after all ¿and so
¿niasz not distinguish tones.

262
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,400
But at least when I'm dancing,

263
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,400
I do not look like I will stick the the
its rear roller tinting.

264
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,400
Enough, You can store today
perform show without me.

265
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,400
So also without me.

266
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,400
Me also.

267
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,400
And me, the ¿.

268
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,400
I do not know why the busiest for me
so long, ¿Eby view the eye,

269
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,400
and see what kind of
in truth you are.

270
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,800
And believe me, it is more sensitive longer possible,
than it seems czyznom husband ¿.

271
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,400
Apparently very little, and many can be e

272
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,400
You will never find
and it's all my fault.

273
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:46,900
Otto No, it's my fault.
I must tell you this.

274
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:51,400
Mia the accident occurred
the labeling of a tragic accident.

275
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,200
I killed the Helga and I will feed you than the the
and I'm very sorry.

276
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:59,600
- What?
- There's dead, is dead.

277
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,500
S I think that that does not suffer of a

278
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:06,800
I'm sorry, I should have you
tell right away, but I can not be the.

279
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,200
I want something knew ebyœ ¿³.

280
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,600
You're the only boss in my life ¿,
which I really like the I,

281
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:15,400

287
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,500
There deserves such a boss like you.

288

Let's go home.

289
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:42,400
Francis is one sentence
which is used the EOE and you do not understand.

290
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,400
What he had in mind the EOE
says the c "feed of you than I are."

291
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:05,200
In the night, when am lost his virginity, taught himself am

00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,700

Also go out on FREEDOM.

298
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:33,500
And so I never find it.

Asshole.

300
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,400
And people are jumping
from one person to another when
