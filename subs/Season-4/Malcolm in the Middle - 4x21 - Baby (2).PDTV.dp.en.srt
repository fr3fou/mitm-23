We are out of luck. Trafiliœmy the bodyguard,

He says the I, also will not be
Potrzebowo of the two dresses.

55
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:14,900
Do not look at me. When
I fly by plane, I take one suitcase.

56
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,100
I'm ready to ride to the hospital.

57
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:24,400
- What? Do not go to the hospital.

No one is going to the hospital!
Already too late!

61
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:38,200
Somebody call an ambulance.

Can you go with me?

00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:40,000
We are not full of interesting magazines in the waiting room.

79
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,700
Highlights like?
Or Goofus and Gallant?

80
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
We do not want g of upich magazines.

81
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,200
I'm sure you also have the very good
care, just like your dad.

82
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,300
You have nothing to do,

83
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,000
/ Except relax and wait
/ Until someone when you arrive.

84
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,400
But something must zrobiæ.
It's our fault.

00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,500
You're a very nervous young man m³ of Young man.

86
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:06,000
I have no idea what you are zrobiæ,
why do not I have been the pediatrician.

87
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,800
Let's go to the waiting room,

88
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,100

where You can store up pokrêciæ.

90
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,700

One, two, three!

93
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,600
It's like moving a piano.

94
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,000
Relax, Mom. Ambulance will
for a while, they know the what to do.

95

Do not worry, Lois.
I write of the in google the word "child".

96
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,000
It is 28 million hits.

97
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,800
Surely there is something after ¿ytecznego.

98
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,800
Craig, you are part of it, we do not need
this. Trey is a doctor.

99
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Oh no, Lois.
I am the dentist.

100
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,200
But to the EOE in medical school, right?

101
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,500
Yes, but I specifically selected the
dentistry, because the ...

00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:03,100
the area below, for
the look, it's starting to chichotaæ.

103
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,400
Yes I have.
From high school.

104
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:10,800

- In the I doubt, ¿me to be the only one.

105
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:12,900

- Part is Malcolm?
- Do not ...

107
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,700
We need his notes to
the task of biological chemistry.

108
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,600
It's not a good time.

109
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Do not say hello to the old grandmother ¹?

110
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,200
I'm Malcolm!
Przechodziliœmy already been through it.

- What are you talking about?!
- Nothing. Do you think that the running away?

115
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,600
Do you think that the being at
one's own mother, who gives birth,

116
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,900
is so uncomfortable,
Wymyœli also the excuse I, ¿Eby exit!

117
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,000
There's even a grain of truth!

118
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,000
Okay, baby clothes,
baby names.

119

00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,400
Hence the Beat, Lloyd!

123
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,300
Rodziæ begin!
For a while I give birth to a child!

124
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,400
This is a very important task.

125
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:13,000
We are the worst Child Lock
in the world. Mama mia ³ a're right!

126
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,000
Really we are by small,
of the young trolls,

127
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,400
which is not anything interesting, apart from the Sun.

128
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,200
I destroy everything of which we have contact.

129
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,300
Poszczêœci to us, as there
We will end in jail or in the grave.

130
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,600
Here's what we'll do.

131
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,600
The event begin to himself for 10 minutes.

132
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,200
They learn how to opiekowaæ up babies.

133
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,400
- We're on it!
- What do you mean?

134
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,000
Learn how pomagaæ.

135
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,200
Come once we learn
how to be good!

136
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:38,900
That's it!

137

Oh, God also!
I was thinking of, also my fingers are exploding!

141
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,200
Well breathes of EOE.

142
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,200
/ Hey!
/ ³ I have found something!

143
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:06,600
In a fraction of a percent of children
are born with tails.

144
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,500
I wonder if they find it easier okazywaæ radoœæ?

145
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,700
Where the hell is the ambulance?

146
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:15,500
The bed at any time.
Steve rang 10 minutes ago.

147
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,800
This is true. In precisely this
I will do the 10 minutes ago.

148
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,200
- Where We bought t the wallpaper?
/ - I really like.

149
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,800
I feel awful.

150
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,900
So we want to walk perfectly well on the job.

151
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,000
Oh, my God also?
We should themselves feel awful.

152
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,600
- You're a terrible Child Lock!
