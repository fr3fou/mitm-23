00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:26,000
The doctor said, I must also carry the
special shoes for another two years.

It's the best, most
advanced private schools and in the world!

19
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:40,000
Do you know how many millions of the issue,

Wait, what am I saying?
You can not jechaæ.

25

Note all.

32

We're back from the doctor,
everything is all right, but ...

33
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,400
the child is a little
We thought higher than the value.

34
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,200
So instead of giving birth for
Two weeks, as planowaliœmy,

45
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,800
