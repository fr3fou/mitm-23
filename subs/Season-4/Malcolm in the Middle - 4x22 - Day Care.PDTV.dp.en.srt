00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,600
I understand also that something else
than what you are accustomed to the EOE.

153
00:09:54,900 --> 00:10:00,200
I opened the em for it
experience and make you feel the spiritual variety.

154
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:06,200
- How looks as Hal?
- Super. I can see that the already insert a window.

155
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,500
We are all at your own risk toolpath.

156
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:18,700
Do not like to walk perfectly well in the bag for garbage,
but I have already clean shirts.

157
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,100
For the sake litoœæ, discontinue semi-AkAA.

158
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,600
Part of Donna. Do not say,
Jamie also again the poorly behaved.

159
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:30,200
- It has a terribly large for energy.
- Yes, it's true.

160
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,600
- Thank you for everything.
- No problem.

161
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,200
And the same answer Seth
and in May the podrzuciæ it to you?

162
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,400
- Seth? What Seth?
- Take care of Seth Richards.

163
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,500
Information is
in the schedule of two weeks.

164
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,200
See?
Saturday - Lois is Seth.

165
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,200
You do not understand.

166
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,900
I only leave their
child outside the Co-op.

167
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,600
Do not care for others - it works.

168
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:52,200
All up exchange.
This is cooperation.

169
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,900
³ am thinking that the one
of the churches of this, where ... you know ...

170
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:59,400
the people feel good when
the selfless do something for other people.

171
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,500
Tomorrow I must pracowaæ! I'm sorry,
but you wymyœliæ something else!

172
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,800
- Seth, hence the need to exit!
- This is my fortress!

173
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,400
I'll be there in a minute ...

174
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,000
/ UFOs are noticeably over a local ranch.

175
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,800
/ Foreman says: "The Flies of the above
/ Earth and the changing of the color green. "

176
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,200
I must admit that I was skeptical of,

177
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:27,600
but poszczêœci of the we
the visits are genuine UFOs.

178
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,300
Yes, yes, yes, but look at me.

179
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:34,700
Are still being shaking, after
I see of this ship at your own eyes.

180
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:38,000
I tell you,
spoke to me telepathically.

181
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,600
/ He was the subsequent observation!

182
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,400
Move the alien on the ranch Songbird!

183
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,600
May the real part of l the downika!

184
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:50,800
What! Not true! K ³ ¹ s!
Otto, we can not pozwoliæ people ...

185
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
For your own safety
Do not wave to them!

186
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,200
The thinking that the hands are our bodies are semi-income securities.

187
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,000
/ You can store ¹ æ start something that you
/ Do not want to skoñczyæ!

188
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,400
- What?!
- I love you!

189
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,200
Discontinue so speak!

190
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,600
Ever since the error to the czyliœmy to a church,
behaves very strangely!

191
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,600
Because I am now another Reese.

192
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:22,300
I sat on the lessons of the Bible
dead, when suddenly I wake the.

193
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,500
I want to now committed ¿owaæ
in something beyond the Sun.

194
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:28,400
In something of great ego.
Come over here.

195
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,400
You can not just me
uderzyæ as it used to?

196
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,700
I'm too szczêœliwy.

197
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,100
It is beautiful!
Wymalowaliœcie and everything!

198
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,200
Welcome home, Hal.

199
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,200
I feel so Trim the oczony!
This time it pour!

200
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,200
You're the best!
May you all God b bless!

201
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,000
Unless you delete my own in the drink.

202
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:43,200
Sorry.
This kid killing me of ...

203
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:44,900
Where is he?!

204
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,500
Lois, for the sake litoœæ,
the kids are watching or not!

205
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,400
Where it has found the EOE?

206
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,500
Under your car.
Splits up the candy bar with the squirrel!

207
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,000
Not the venom and, unless it is sick.

208
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,200
Lois, I try to be
the most helpful,

209
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,800
but I can not goniæ
the entire operation store!

210
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,600
Why not close it
in the car, like the other mothers of the email.

211
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:09,900
Ms. Monson wants to ¿Eby
release of a lady of my brother!

212
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:10,700
What?

213
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,300
Ever since d Reese comes to your lessons,
became the me I really were!

214
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,600
Trust me, it's awful.

215
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,000
I do not like a church!

216
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,800
Ever since there przyszliœmy d,
it is continuously thinking about things.

217
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:25,900
What kind of God makes
Suggest children also are outside the schools!

218
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:31,100
This is not the torture.
I'm sure you also have their reasons.

219
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,000
As Roy says the pastor that God
is large for larger and m are smarter than us.

220
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,600
A trial domyœlenia about the thoughts,

221
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,500
it's like the old ant and
rozgryŸæ up my thoughts.

222
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,000
Yes, exactly.

223
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:46,000
But we can zaufaæ his m³ droœci
and wierzyæ, also cares about us.

224
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,800
Like me with the anthill in the backyard.

225
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,900
The entire bottom of the email I watch the ants

226
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,800
try the c domyœliæ in
which are good and which of the e

227
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,100
But all-looking like ants,

228
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,400
So here we all uderzaæ.

229
00:14:58,700 --> 00:14:59,200
There is ...

230
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:03,600
I struck them in the ¿I garden,
I poured the gasoline are, running over ¿d ¿³ em and the mower.

231
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,800
Bed ¹ c honest, it seems to me that
Also reflected on me with the cost of the.

232
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,500
These ants can were up
modliæ me a whole day,

233
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,800
and still I have not heard of the service.

234
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,300
- I can not were the zrobiæ.
- But, no ...

235
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,900
So it is with us.

236
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:20,500
¿This we can not do anything about zrobiæ,
So why przejmowaæ?

237
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,500
Better get a feel for the em.

238
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,500
That's good, but ...

239
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:30,400
The only thing we can zrobiæ it be
most ¿yczliwymi and decent.

240
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,800
I staraæ up Do not stop,
if God is with great ¹ ³ ¹ charged.

241
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,100
Part!

242
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,600
Make me ¿cost of $ 50!

243
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,900
- I'm the cute?
- No, you're not the pretty!

244
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,100
Mia the am because of you lot
k the hassle and I'm fairly, are you've heard?

245
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,000

- Part, Mom! Part, Dad!

246
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,800
- Is it ...

247
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:58,000
Yes, I am. I know that it can oddly
Daae appearance, but are his dribbling say:

- Dot pleasure?
- For God's sake!

251
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:08,900
Seth! OdejdŸ from the
women, now!

252
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,800
I painted a picture of the pretty.

253
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,300
/ My ¿can the reeds

254
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,400
/ Ranch Songbird - left
/ Ranch Grotto - right

255
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,400
- What the hell are you doing here?
- What does it look like the impossible?

256
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,800
What kind of alien.
Œwiecisz not even in darkness!

257
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,300
- Hence the Beat!
- You hence the falling!

258
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,200
- You hence the falling!
- You hence the falling!

259
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,200
You get out ...

260
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,600
Hal had the terrible am
As of the child.

261
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,700
I'm sorry that the ³ I can not help you.

262
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:02,200
Barely back of em
the whole day trips parish council.

263
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:06,200
Did you come I knew that the there are 6 types
May Hay and all the patrons?

264
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:10,500
Hal Listen to me. Beyond
resist was to work with the child.

265
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,800
But you are still thinking of am, I have also
choice and I have to robiæ for Jamie.

266
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:18,300
His parents came to the a terrible
situation, and then ... the am to see.

267
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:24,100
- Hey, it's the pretty picture.
- This is the Genesis ¿s can in the bulrushes.

268
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:28,600
I began to am myœleæ about this story.
When a mother and had to exit the your little one

269
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:31,400
and entrust them of a river,
Foster Eby ¿³ be someone else.

270
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,300
I want to be as the mother of the!

271
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:36,600
Hal ...

272
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,800
I do not like the child.

273
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,000
You say not serious?

274
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,800
I know it's awful,
does not deserve to be a mother are,

275
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:48,200
should be full at the ideal
the continuity of maternal love, but she's not!

276
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,100
There is simply no!

277
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:53,300
- I do not believe that the are talking about!
- I know, it's awful.

278
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:58,200
- Really do not remember, do you?
- What you do not remember?

279
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,100
Honey, Did you come to hate
all of our children.

280
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,800

With Reese six months, but
It biting the nipples, so I do not blame him.

283
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,900
Did you come zostawiæ wanted Francis to
rural market, ¿Eby Foster were his cows.

284
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,200
Oh, my God also?

285
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:23,200
You're tired. Everything seems to
Trim up the words including the sun, but trust me.

286
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,300
In a few weeks

287

you will love this child as
no sooner does not love the child.

Hey, do not I hear.

Come on!
As early as the time!

00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,200
All I understood the
the first day in the Church.

296
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:19,300
When everything is ready,
This will be the best day of my life ¿!

297
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,200
What are you doing?

298
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:26,200
I'll be the anniversary above the clouds and experience
joy, which are only having to know the birds.

299
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,000
Fry is static on the cables
