You know, we had large overdraft s and more
child will make things even more difficult.

152
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:04,600
So in light of what in the burden on us
falls not carefully ck that some

153
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,200

221
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,200
And your mother is pregnant ¹ ¿y

222

00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,500
No Wages for a break.

230
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:43,600
Mom of sermons and did not speak.
From some reason and tried to protect the grandmother.

231
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,600
What is the grandmother,
Also mom is pregnant strives?

232
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,100

going on? You have too little about the issues or what?

235
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I do not believe in what I can see!

What are you talking about?

241
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,800
They said something about the stagnation of the semi-atnoœciami.
It must be jakiœ loophole.

242
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,700
So regardless of what your mother would do,
We will have semi-Latin from one's own pocket.

243
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,100
Oh, my God also?

244
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:27,400
I have a good message!
As we were all nervous lately.

245
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,100
I was thinking about the what can I do, ¿Eby all
uszczêœliwiæ. And then I wymyœli of it.

246
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:36,900
It's the most obvious thing in the world.
I bought the pool for all of us!

247
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:41,000
And the best part is that the do not have to
for the semi-Latin for the first 6 months.

248
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:47,000
This is an inflatable crocodile. With r the pods.
In precisely setting the pool on the outside.

249
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
And not only I give thanks.
It would also block any service Dewey.

Mom is pregnant ¹ ¿y

253
00:17:55,900 --> 00:18:00,200
What! It is not possible! You know how dangerous
is to have a child and the pool and at the same time?

254

and now that I will not even had the.

258
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:28,000
Kumacie not the point.
You're looking at the short term.

259
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,000
It all sucks.
I had the jakieœ plans. Can I pójœæ to the College!

Ida, do not have insurance. Zalegaliœmy
of semi-atnoœciami and remove us from the program.

266
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:09,700
If you do not interrupt this process are tional
it'll ruin us. Do you understand?

I'm sure that the date of the Council. Agencies

274
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,100
Where are you going?

275
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:55,800
Unsubscribe. They do not have the insurance. Do you think that the
I'll take 40% of the dziadowskiego home?

276
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,500
30%.
And exactly this way of thinking.

I had to parkowaæ my Porsche podjeŸdzie.

278

3 months strives those women stoke the hormones.
