This way of comparing
objects to the constant amount of water.

This forces you to angle the bath.

You can not zmusiæ me for anything!

93
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,800
Alison and had the right,
You're a explosive.

94
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,500
What are you talking about?

95
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,200
He says of a, you're a ...

98
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,800
No, no, you have to.
Give it to me.

99
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:25,600
It is not a properly about it
and what he said, but how.

100
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,800
This zasch of a, we need more fluid.

101
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,200
Ok, ... go on.

102
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,900
Ok, Reese is the easy,
but it is good.

103
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:37,100
Otto.

104
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,300
- Francis.
- There is a problem with this film.

105
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,400
S ³ yszeliœmy that the some of the actors
did not appear, but do not worry.

106
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,800
Dave employ of Gretchen.

107
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:48,300
- What? No!
- It is quite low and the role of ¿.

108
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:53,700
Just come in and say, "I think
potrzebowaæ we'll be more towels. "

109
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,100
I'm leaving.

110
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:59,200
- You have no idea what kind of movie?
- This is supposedly independent cinema AD.

111
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,200
If the "Sundance Film Festival"
does not mean anything.

112
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:07,000
This would mean the that the niskobud ¿budgets videos
can not rywalizowaæ of superprodukcjami.

113
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,800
- But ...
- Not important what kind of movie.

114
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:16,000
This makes it also feels
so well, you know.

115
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:19,300
As is the girl had dreams of am.

116
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,400
But they said that the no
to the am sufficiently at the pretty.

117
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,200
I also was not of sufficient am as smart.

118
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,500
Your mother and that of the cows are jealous.

119
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,800
Thank you Francis,
I am very grateful to you.

120
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:34,200
Dad had no time, search for a
new babysitter, so I have been and Jessica.

121
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,300
What does not bother me.
And so we do not spend much time here.

122
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,900
- Dewey, what are you eating?
- Sticks of carrots.

123
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,200
Jessica says,
Also we need more from ¿ywiaæ.

124
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:47,700
I do not know what a company
it does, but I hate them.

125
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,600
- Reese?
- Do not wchodŸ on the floor of!

126
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,300
Jessica and he said,
Also how to scrub the floor of,

127
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,900
This will tell you how far
Alison wants to have gone with me the æ.

128
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,900
Part of Malcolm, you can take the
are the atkê and nakryæ to one of u

129
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,500
I wonder, can you do
it myself, because I go to the movies.

130
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:06,200
The school day?
Do you think that the Hal that it wanted to?

131
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,400
He is not here, so if
I want AEOI to the movies, I go.

132
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,600
Malcolm, thinking,
Hal also looking at you ...

133
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,100
Hal nazywaæ discontinue it!

134
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,300
No I think that you can kontrolowaæ
I like these two.

135
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,000
What are you talking about?

136
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,900
I'm not saying that the do not have the ability.

137
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,300
I just wasting my time,
I ¹ m smarter than you.

138
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,000
- In what way?
- My brain operates differently, okay?

139
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,600
I can see what you are doing and planning
at the same time.

140
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,300
So if you have two brains?

141
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,200
Of course, also do not!
No one has two brains.

142
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,200
You know what operates
wielozdaniowoœæ on my computer?

143
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,100
Draw you a diagram?

144
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,500
Obtain a we, also the round connector, then your
œwiadomy of mind at the time than ordinary conversation.

145
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,900
Crossing the months go of round
Another represents the toolpath.

146
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,200
Not opposite to the first ...

147
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,700
Wait a minute.
Release.

148
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,600
¯ Eby was to understand the you find it easier,
t call the toolpath "side quests".

149
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,600
So in my brain are like
4 of the path that run the same time.

150
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,400
One whole wall supervising ¿ka
All keeps the stomach. I think that the terms o ..

151
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:03,400
Part of guys.

152

The hand-held two tickets to "Oss Fest".

155
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,400
For the best seller of the month.

156
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,300

157

163
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:45,000
Randy. Do not try to speak to you as
pracowaæ you, but sometimes a little ...

164
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,100
Are they are doing this for me?

165
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,000
You know what kind of sound.
That sound of success.

166
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:00,700
Sometimes I feel as if that were the three dimensions,
I can almost reach it ¹ æ ¹ æ touch.

167
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,700
These could not be purely logical, and ...

168
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,100
- Malcolm. It's getting late stage.
- Really?

169
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,200

Anyway, I'm glad you also know
already if you're away from me m the wiser.

171
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,800
Ok, Jessica takes over the house
and we need to recover.

172
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,200

As soon as he finishes sent in a for
Tomorrow our clothes, making them easier for the j.

00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,600
I agree.
It ends with now.

177
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,200
You know, I'm really tired.

178
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,200
It is ¿.
And it is already fairly late stage.

179
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,700
The large the better I will be sensitive,

180
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,100
- But tomorrow.

181
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,200
Without a doubt.

182
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,600
Do I wash the teeth?

183
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,100
Sorry, Patrick.

184
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,300
I love Gretchen.
It's like my mom.

You can not they change the
dialogues in the last minute.

195
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,000
Simply browse.
Just a little different differs.

196
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,700

00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,200
- A T. ..

198
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,500
We do not know
how to get rid of up Jessica.

199
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:45,000
But the whole quite strongly
give her life a misery.

200
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,300
It's only a matter of time.

201
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:50,100
- Your tea!
- Thank you, Malcolm.

And I'll tell Alison, also spend the EOE
hour on the phone with Cindy Read.
