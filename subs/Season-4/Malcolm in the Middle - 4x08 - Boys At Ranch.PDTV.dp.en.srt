No appearance you give to me for 16 years.

Would not be talking like this,

From now on, stay away from

How can the EOE be so cruel?

146
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:32,200
EOE promised me that you do not touch it,
but it was to just a lie.

147
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,600
IdŸcie the room, now!

Why not just pour out the

171

When they lose feeling in my fingers,
and back frightening at the pain.

172
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,400
It feels large for better.

What's wrong with this horse?

179
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,000
Nothing, Garnuszek is very s the sweet.

No, I said of you,
Historically, for me, is good.

183

I forced the pot
to return and confrontation.

00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,200
Such sex we had not for years.

188
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,500
Thank you, Garnuszek!

189
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,300
You should also jechaæ on your horse.

190
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,800
Good idea was.
Scout is afraid of nothing.

Do you have something special?

206
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,200
It depends how much you want to spend it all.

Then scrub.

Look at the blood.
We are in the middle of the road.

I've never seen the em
so many stars in the sky.

238
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,600
 - Look, there's Orion.
- Where?

239
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,900
There.
The three stars of his belt.

240
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:48,600
There?

241
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,500
There, there.

242
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,500
And there, is it in the spear.

243
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,300
Super!
Something scared of the horses.

244
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,600
Bite me something about the

245
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,000
God, Otto, you're hurt!

246
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,200
Finally something I hit the.

247
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:27,000
In precisely to the em at the door
the boys and nothing can not hear.

248
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,400
I do not like them krzyczeæ,
but this is the only way to the statue listened.

249
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,200
Absolutely.

250
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,500
He was em raw, but fair.

251
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,300
Byœ He could not be more just.

252
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:39,800
S smile, so for two
second looks as I'll be the idiot.

253
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:42,000
- You can speak on it if you want.
- Tell me.

254
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,600
The boys not in the room of three hours.

255
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,200
What!

256
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,200
I want the, spotkaæ up
at the southern gate.

257
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,200
That should be all explained by.

258
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,200
I'm afraid I also started to speak a little hostile.

259
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,400
Latest word is
"Pokonaæ" and "exterminate"?

260
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:56,900
I think that you're safe.

261
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,500
How long are you gniesz me?

262
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:06,600
Rate the c on the basis of that
rock formation, jakieœ 4 meters.

263
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:12,700
If only Francis knew he was
Also here we are, the savings to us.

264
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,500
Of course, the Super-Francis!

265
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:19,300
He will do a jetpack with cactus
and when we arrive!

266
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,600
Why are you on the one with the s?

267
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,400
I'm not were for Francis.

268
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:27,200
You should not be.
It's smart meters are capable of.

269
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:32,900
It's working. I will never meet the em
someone more trustworthy.

270
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,200
So, now!
But I know him 18 years!

271
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,200
The penalty of em it threatens the em him

272
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:43,800
aka the semi-em with it, b I begged him,
I shouted; him.

273
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,500
And he perpetrated the b ing the error for b of edema.

274
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:52,900
Two months with you
and is now a model citizen.

275
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:58,900
- So you're one with the s?
- I think it's fairly obvious.

276
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:03,500
Potrzebowo the only
Eby ¿³ ¹ father disappeared from his sight.

277
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:07,800
I know of someone who knows
as odmieniæ force.

278
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,200
Strange, since I'm such a genius,

279
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:16,300
that's why I'm drunk
the desert with bullets in the back of the bed of

280
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,600
Listen to me.

281
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:26,200
Francis has not won the all the
of small features great one day.

282
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:32,100
Do you think that the raises it out of the way?

283
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:37,500
"Hello, I'd like to Buy the large
gum, candy bar and now the osobowoœæ. "

284
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:40,000
No, Hal, Listen to me.

285
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:46,200
Jab ³ ko apple falls far from the hand.

286
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,900
So I'm not so
a terrible father?

287
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,500
Absolutely not!

288
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:59,400
If you already finished the semi-AkAA EOE, my
the books you need massages in order to return to normal.

289
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:03,800
Well, Dewey.
We can not exit the ¿any place.

290
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000

292
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:10,900

Finally.
Skoñczyliœmy.

Wow!

295
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,700
Beautiful, is not it?

296
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,800
This moment is worth it,
your soul is free.

297
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,000
You're clean as before.

298
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:31,900
- I feel like the swims.
- It's probably ammonia.

299
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,800
But, odwaliliœmy slice of good works.

300

I want you something Daae.

304
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,200
Think about me,
When will it be that to use.

305
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,300
Thank you Gretchen.

306
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:02,000
I do not know what you want here have reached the æ,
Know-but you, also I'm on you with the y

307
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,500
- What is it?
- Looks like a fuse.

308
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,400
- What exactly are you planning?
- We plan you recover!

309
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:16,100
We back brother
How this was to.

310
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,800
We know how you like fire, explosions.

311
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:27,000
- Unrealised of the trial, it was to long ago.
- Really?

312
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,700
So where it leads?

313
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:38,900
You can dowiedzieæ to pass the c
under the fence and d c for the fuse.

314
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:42,200
Or you can dowiedzieæ
in the manner of Francis.

315
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,000
Definitely make your decisions are good.

316
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:49,800
I'm telling you, everything
changed the o I am the wife, to become the beam.

317
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,300
I'm already sixteen
geek who ...

318
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,100
Interesting.

319
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,700
Is something looks as familiar to you, Otto?

320
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,500
We follow in the direction of the mountains.

321
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,100
Behind us is certain in death.

322
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,200
That's right, now there is a certain in death.

323
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,400
I wonder what it is.

324
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:34,400
I'll tell you that Francis
shows us the way home!

325
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,300
- I said of you also save us.
- Yes!

326
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,400
Let's go there.

327
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,800
It's better than returning home in 1998.

328
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,900
I do not know, the smoke of a raft for a week.

329
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,100
When will Komodo 3000?

330
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,000
I think it was to that.

331
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,900
They told us when he gets away?

332
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,100
Bob he said that the two days.

333
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,300
He was worth it.

334
