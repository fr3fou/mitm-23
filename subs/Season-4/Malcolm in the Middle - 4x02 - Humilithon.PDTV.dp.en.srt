But she's already such that the a

101
00:07:06,300 -> 00:07:10,500
Do not think so. If you want the books are Another tablespoon
then you have to pay the $ 40 for Latin ¹ t. Next.

This is also the inside.

110
00:07:42,400 -> 00:07:44,700
Mom, leave me alone.
You make me g of the pistil.

and not on Tuesdays. Additional Robilibyœmy sandwiches.

116
00:08:08,200 -> 00:08:12,800
Thinking they ¿that the table should become the
front of the TV and the couch in front of the refrigerator.

117
00:08:14,500 -> 00:08:20,000
Also thinking that the clothes should not be the piece of cloth-
Land, children should parodiowaæ, schools and should

118
00:08:20,000 -> 00:08:23,100
last for 4 hours a day
and should be on the top floor of the building.

119
00:08:24,700 -> 00:08:25,900
Thinking they ¿...

120
00:08:26,300 -> 00:08:32,100
Angela comes back tomorrow, so it replaces Todd on
"Wanderer by nature," so Todd also help in the kitchen

121
00:08:32,100 -> 00:08:33,700
which made it possible Soni mowing hay.

122
00:08:33,800 -> 00:08:35,200

126
00:08:48,600 -> 00:08:53,600
Ok, I have a plan. I'll do this:
I'll be the first world ¿Firefighter in school are girls.

127
00:08:53,600 -> 00:08:55,100

128
00:08:55,100 -> 00:09:01,000

Wait until the œ fondness as if jakaœ to like me.

129
00:09:01,100 -> 00:09:02,900
