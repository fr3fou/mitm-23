You see, I always plant the adam,
Also when people know the ¿Are you kidding,

but sometimes they do not understand the
and have a moron.

00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,700
There also do not understand.
Zabrzmieæ I do not want to patronize.

48
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:10,100
Just thinking about large
about such matters.

49
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:14,600
The crap I should speak

50

How old are you ... time?

53

I always spoil everything.
Even with just the girls are perfect as Alison.

54
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,900
Alison is ... blunt.
Not the point.

55
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,300
The problem is me.
Too much thinking over everything.

56
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,300
Really, I podtrzymaæ
than ordinary conversation without collapsing it.

57
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:42,800
Why is my brain will not let me
szczêœliwym be?

58
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,100
I must AEOI baby.
Going to art galleries?

59
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,200
This is not art!

60
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,200
Sorry.

61
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,300
Going to space
which ones sell overstatement of cost-ch am

impaled tourists without a hint of taste?

63
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:59,500
Remember the EOE.

64
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,800
/ Thank you very much.

65
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,500
Nice to me was to robiæ
business with you, Mr. Dodson.

66
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,700
Come on, Francis.
Meet Mr. Dodson.

67
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:08,900
It's great were part of man.

68
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:12,900
From certainly be more than once
slaughtered in the market.

69
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,600
In my time already.

70
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,500
I have to œpieszyæ to another client,
I'll see you gentlemen.

71
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,800
Soon, I'll check.

72
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:22,000
But with me szczêœciarz.

73
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:26,100
When I leave the homelands all friends
warned me, "Otto, b are each carefully ny".

74
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:30,000
"People want to bed the wykorzystywaæ you."
But none of these things.

75
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:36,200
As for example, Mr. Dodson.
He knows much more than I ation about managing the ranch.

76
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,900
But whether behaves
of the O ¿szoœci, and cocking his nose?

77
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,900
No. Instead, it teaches me.

78
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:48,000
For today for example, I did not know of that the cows
in need of protection against ultraviolet.

79
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,400
What? What is this stuff?

80
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,600
UV filter. For cows.

81
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,800
Otto, how much for it will give the EOE?

82
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,200
$ 200 per bucket,
plus, of course, maœæ Zinc-coated on the nose.

83
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:05,700
Do not worry.
Already he pays the ignition em.

84
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:08,900
How long they got for a thousand dollars?

85
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,600
Oh, Mom!

86
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,600
For years, the dream of em.

87
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:17,600
What? The reflections of you? We can not zrobiæ
this at home. There is my family.

88
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:22,500
But we can up spotkaæ

89
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,000
It prêdkoœciomierz, and is a measure of vibration.

90
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,200
It has been reported. That's it!

91
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:32,700
I can not doczekaæ,
ways to align a pair of the little one.

92
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,100
Appearance Looks like you're a willing.

93
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,800
Yes. Let me also ask
about something, hypothetically.

94
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,200
If I chance for something
and pass the zloty, ie changes ¿d ¿s of the dust,

95
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,100
so that no one will recognize the ...

96
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:52,800
Had to byœ Approach to
Fixed cylinder.

97
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
That is, if the following are five of
such a tragic accident.

98
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:56,900
¯ s what please?

99
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,800
S ³ Look, a lot of "road builders" is
your way these fragile obstacles to bypass.

100
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:06,600
What if I encounter such a fragile object of ...?

101
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,600
He could only speed up the byœ

102
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:11,800
until when this object is not already
threat to the roadworks.

103
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Sign here and you can
zabraæ to work.

104
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:32,200
STAA me for more.

105
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,400
The angel of you, Stevie.

106
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,200
You will be happy to goœciæ always
when I go somewhere your parents are.

107
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:40,500
Sure, Hawaii are œwietne,
but we are well ¿Se having fun, right?

108
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,400
Clear that, yes.

109
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,600
I did not bought the am.

110
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,400
Cheapening were about 49 cents.
These are the of oil.

111
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,000
You do not have uczyæ on exams?

112
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,400
Tomorrow I have, like, three.

113
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,600
Are not you afraid that if the up
no you will not learn it?

114
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,600
No.

115
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,400
- How do you do?

116
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,800
How do you AEOI by force not
the c dead sure that the something happens to you from the ego?

117
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I do not know.

118
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:17,800
I think when you start just martwiæ
Sing the song myœlach Minty-mint.

119
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,600
"Refresh hose extensions, the orzeŸwiaj,
Restore the world ¿s breath.

120
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,600
"Minty-Mints a friend
your breath. "

121
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:27,000
So when I ask you for the exams
the EOE thinking about this song?

122
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,000
Yes.

"Minty-Mints a friend

125
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,900
Reese! You're a genius.

126
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,700
This girl, Alison, and I ask of you
everyone in the world speaks with an accent, except for us.

127
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,800
And instead of her laboriously explained by t,
Think of a song I minty-mint.

128

And the answer I "because leeks are the suck"
and that she'd like the o

129
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,200

00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,800
And he said that the'm cute,
And he touched my arm and the.

131
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,200
Let it be

132
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,900
Here she is.

133
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:04,800
Oh, boy.
I succeeded in only once.

134
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,700
- What if it was to just fart?
- Oh do not worry.

135
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,900
- I'm still learning.
- Calm down.

136
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:13,200
- Just repeat after me the.
- Part Malcolm.

137

Did you forget pm you about something zapytaæ.

00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:21,800
Well do you feel?
Want inputs to the class?

139
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,100
No, just killing time
before the break the œniadaniow.

140

I know what you mean.

O my God e
Think of am the same.

145

It would be cool if exchanged coins
jednodolarowe on miliondolarowe.

146
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,600
In this way, no one was to be poor
and all we would be millionaires.

147
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,800
This idea was œwietny.

00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,800
We should check that
if you're not accidentally bliŸniakami.

299
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,400
- I'll ask my mom when I get home.
- At precisely the wpad am a brilliant idea was.

300
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,500
I know one of the older class
of zabunkrowanym beer.

301
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,400
No way.

302
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,700
We can take the æ szeœciopak, blanket
and pójœæ a football field.

303
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,200

Also soon will.

305
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:32,900
Illegal drinking, quickie with the girls
in a risky place.

306
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,800
High School government today!

307
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,900

00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:58,000
Can only one government d

309
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:10,400
Hence the OdejdŸ, son!
I do not want, byœ me that he knew of!

310
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:14,400
- Dad, you have the crap!
- Really, I am!

311
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:21,200
/ I love you so.

312
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,600
I'm proud of you, Dad.

313
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:52,500
Where do you want to sit off the œæ?
Because I am thinking about the 50-yard line.

314
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,500
But for long would have to be there AEOI.

315
00:19:54,700 --> 00:20:00,600
You have nothing to denerwowaæ, Stevie.
I'll dance with you the first few dances.

316
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,400
Stop yourself winiæ!
That dude is a complete donkey of.

317
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,000
Throw out the beer,
find someone who will drive you home,

318
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,800
and then break up with this Pacan.

319
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:16,800
That's precisely the'd do if I did not have
you of the enclosed brain for the entire week for s.

320
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,500
Here's what we've really done the.

321
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:33,500
"Minty-Mints a friend
your breath. "

322
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,000
Mom and he said,
Also asks the EOE j are about it.

323
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:40,300
- How's my gal?
- I do not know. No longer krzyczeæ.

324
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,400
Not yet seen of a
even my report.

325
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,900
I think I'll be had to have
the average 8.0 to exit on a clean.

326
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,600
What can zrobiæ,
as that the already znormalnia of em.

327
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:52,000
Alison and broke the with me as soon as
is used in the sentence I of the word "paradox".

328
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:56,600
Welcome back.
I'm sorry for Allison.

329
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:01,400
It's no big deal.

330
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,100
You know what I do not understand football?

331
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,900
Why visiting second ¿yna
has so many various different uniforms?

332
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,200
I do not know.
Stuffed kids.
