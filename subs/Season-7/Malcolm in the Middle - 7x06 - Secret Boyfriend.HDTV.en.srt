1
00:00:01,486 --> 00:00:02,793
Here, I brought one for you.

2
00:00:02,823 --> 00:00:06,223
Thanks. And now I'll take yours
because you obviously shook mine up.

3
00:00:07,641 --> 00:00:08,341
Wait a minute.

4
00:00:09,192 --> 00:00:10,442
You wanted me to do that.

5
00:00:11,948 --> 00:00:14,848
Of course, you had to have
known I was going to know that.

6
00:00:15,464 --> 00:00:18,814
Unless you didn't think I was smart
enough, but I'm smarter than...

7
00:00:19,642 --> 00:00:21,985
You know what? I'm not smart
enough to figure it out.

8
00:00:22,015 --> 00:00:23,559
So what? Big deal.

9
00:00:30,752 --> 00:00:32,932
I'm not sure if I have
the gift or he does.

10
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:40,900
Malcolm in the Middle
7.06 - "Secret Boyfriend"

11
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:51,900
Synchronisation par Max & Tyno,
Script original par Raceman.

12
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:02,900
Forom.com, Life-is-Unfair.tk
& Malcolm-France.com

13
00:01:10,167 --> 00:01:14,338
Oh, great. I have Larry Neff
as a lab partner; the groper.

14
00:01:14,492 --> 00:01:19,585
The experiment's going to be hard enough
as it is without my lab partner trying
to honk my boobs every five minutes.

15
00:01:19,615 --> 00:01:22,565
You think you've got it bad?
I got stuck with Vicki Jarret.

16
00:01:27,054 --> 00:01:29,604
Brad, not again!
You're hilarious!

17
00:01:32,451 --> 00:01:33,936
Okay, so she's totally hot.

18
00:01:34,187 --> 00:01:36,106
But I'm going to end up
doing all the work by myself,

19
00:01:36,136 --> 00:01:38,436
which would be fine,
but then she'll ask me to explain it.

20
00:01:38,466 --> 00:01:40,960
And then she'll just have to cry because
the little bulb on top of her spine

21
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:44,217
that she calls a brain will
start to hurt, and then I'll
end up looking like a jerk.

22
00:01:44,247 --> 00:01:46,888
Oh, come on, Malcolm.
Give her a chance.

23
00:01:47,106 --> 00:01:50,306
Hey, maybe you two can come up
with a new formula for lip gloss.

24
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:55,599
Okay, you got your partners.

25
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:57,389
Let's get started.

26
00:01:58,406 --> 00:01:58,811
Hi.

27
00:01:59,583 --> 00:02:00,065
Hi.

28
00:02:00,285 --> 00:02:01,685
I have a confession to make.

29
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:03,930
I requested you
as a lab partner.

30
00:02:04,031 --> 00:02:05,581
Yeah, that doesn't surprise me.

31
00:02:05,601 --> 00:02:07,944
Look, I'll walk you through the
experiment, I'll do your homework,

32
00:02:07,974 --> 00:02:10,162
but I will not cheat on
a test for you, okay?

33
00:02:10,192 --> 00:02:10,810
Fair enough.

34
00:02:10,991 --> 00:02:11,550
Okay.

35
00:02:12,052 --> 00:02:15,202
I'll dry the substrate and remove
the ether on the evaporators.

36
00:02:15,533 --> 00:02:19,146
You, uh, want to wash the beakers?
That's science, too.

37
00:02:20,343 --> 00:02:22,443
Come on, Malcolm,
I am a part of the team.

38
00:02:22,613 --> 00:02:23,578
Vicki, believe me.

39
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:27,178
I would let you help if I had
any confidence that you knew
what we were trying to do here.

40
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:30,065
But all you do is sit in class and you
giggle and whisper to your friends...

41
00:02:30,095 --> 00:02:35,202
Hand me the morpholino-cyclohexene,
and you mix in the drydioxane with
the methylvinylketone.

42
00:02:36,886 --> 00:02:38,198
Oh, my God, you're smart!

43
00:02:39,876 --> 00:02:41,458
Nobody needs to know that.

44
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:45,148
I don't get it. Why do you
need me to be your partner?

45
00:02:46,394 --> 00:02:47,694
Maybe I think you're cute.

46
00:02:48,197 --> 00:02:52,720
Anyway, it'd be nice to talk to someone
about something deeper than the latest
ringtone they downloaded.

47
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,100
Most of my friends think...

48
00:02:54,614 --> 00:02:58,764
I know she's still talking,
but I didn't hear anything
after "I think you're cute."

49
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,419
-Oh, for God's sake!
-What is it?

50
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:11,366
A notice for Reese to sign up for
Career Day which was last Wednesday.
He completely blew it off.

51
00:03:11,798 --> 00:03:16,048
What are we going to do with
him, Hal? He shows absolutely
no interest in his future.

52
00:03:16,324 --> 00:03:18,721
Sorry, honey, I thought you
had given up on him, too.

53
00:03:18,751 --> 00:03:22,851
He doesn't go to school,
he doesn't work. He's 18
years old, and he's still Reese.

54
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,447
That is not acceptable.

55
00:03:24,777 --> 00:03:26,027
What are you going to do?

56
00:03:28,027 --> 00:03:29,069
Dad, I did it.

57
00:03:29,103 --> 00:03:31,668
I went to the Putt-Putt Palace
and I beat your best golf score.

58
00:03:31,698 --> 00:03:33,898
Good for you, Dewey.
Hey, let's have a look.

59
00:03:35,476 --> 00:03:38,307
Four in The Witch's Den.
Got caught in the swamp, huh?

60
00:03:38,869 --> 00:03:40,923
That's why I always
take a pitching wedge.

61
00:03:40,953 --> 00:03:43,575
Yeah, but then I birdied Three
Little Pigs and Pirate's Cove.

62
00:03:43,605 --> 00:03:44,652
Fantastic.

63
00:03:45,027 --> 00:03:50,047
Of course, there was an unusually high
pollen count when I got my top score,
so who knows what it could have been?

64
00:03:50,077 --> 00:03:52,377
But that doesn't take
anything away from this.

65
00:03:52,549 --> 00:03:54,878
It is quite an
achievement, son.

66
00:03:56,184 --> 00:03:59,459
Hey, a hole-in-one on the 18th?

67
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,212
You got a free game!

68
00:04:01,501 --> 00:04:04,380
Actually, the ball got stuck in
the hole in the clown's mouth.

69
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,410
-So the guy said I didn't qualify.
-What?

70
00:04:06,912 --> 00:04:11,643
Everyone knows you ace the 18th hole,
you win a free game! It's a sacred pact!

71
00:04:11,913 --> 00:04:17,013
You throw that out, next thing you
know you're going to have a man
marrying a horse down at City Hall.

72
00:04:17,898 --> 00:04:19,586
-Which guy was he?
-I don't know.

73
00:04:19,748 --> 00:04:23,331
-Really tall, kind of heavy.
-Oh, I know him.

74
00:04:23,775 --> 00:04:26,875
I was two tickets short of a
giant comb and he wouldn't budge.

75
00:04:27,056 --> 00:04:30,211
Ended up with a troll keychain
that went bald inside a week.

76
00:04:31,194 --> 00:04:33,162
So what'd you do about it?

77
00:04:33,267 --> 00:04:34,676
It's no big deal, Dad.

78
00:04:34,714 --> 00:04:37,087
You let people take
advantage of you.

79
00:04:37,747 --> 00:04:39,197
But I got my best score ever.

80
00:04:39,714 --> 00:04:43,766
Son, I look at this card
and all I see is shame.

81
00:04:55,901 --> 00:04:57,425
Here we go, honey.

82
00:04:58,091 --> 00:05:03,570
Now, I know it's against
doctor's orders, but I did get
us a little something sweet.

83
00:05:04,893 --> 00:05:08,946
Okay, Hal, but you be careful
with your new bridgework.

84
00:05:10,306 --> 00:05:12,303
Oh, would you look at that?

85
00:05:12,702 --> 00:05:14,607
Little Robby was
such a cute baby.

86
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:20,898
Oh, that reminds me. Malcolm called
while you were out. It seems Robby has
burned down the neighbor's pool house.

87
00:05:21,092 --> 00:05:23,689
Malcolm says he's at his
wit's end with that boy.

88
00:05:32,936 --> 00:05:34,020
Are you ready for this?

89
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:35,709
I got an "F" on my math final.

90
00:05:35,729 --> 00:05:38,591
Oh, no, Reese,
I thought you said you studied.

91
00:05:38,622 --> 00:05:40,032
Why do I even waste my time?!

92
00:05:40,062 --> 00:05:43,826
You know Mr. Escobar totally
has it out for me 'cause I used
to call his dad "Braceface."

93
00:05:43,856 --> 00:05:46,044
But you are going to
pass this time, right, son?

94
00:05:46,074 --> 00:05:47,764
Do I look like a genie?!

95
00:05:47,862 --> 00:05:49,561
I can't predict the future!

96
00:05:49,782 --> 00:05:53,332
So why don't you just do me a favor
and get off my back, okay, old man!

97
00:05:53,917 --> 00:05:58,284
-You can't treat your father like that!
-Shove a cork in it, you crazy old hag!

98
00:05:59,071 --> 00:06:02,140
-My heart pills.
-You'll get these when I get a sandwich.

99
00:06:02,313 --> 00:06:04,444
Off your wrinkled butt!
Go, go, go!

100
00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:12,455
Reese, you may think you're pulling
some kind of scam, but I'm on to you!

101
00:06:12,682 --> 00:06:15,373
You are getting a job
starting tomorrow!

102
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:18,419
And keep your dirty mitts
off your father's toupee!

103
00:06:21,812 --> 00:06:23,612
I had the weirdest
dream last night.

104
00:06:23,896 --> 00:06:26,726
This crazy witch with snakes
for hair was screaming at me.

105
00:06:26,756 --> 00:06:30,847
It was like she was going to kill me,
but for some reason it was really
important to her that I get a job.

106
00:06:30,877 --> 00:06:32,153
Did she have bugged
out crazy eyes?

107
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:32,643
Yeah!

108
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:34,789
She shows up in a
lot of my dreams.

109
00:06:35,343 --> 00:06:36,462
Good morning, Reese.

110
00:06:36,689 --> 00:06:38,139
You going to get a job today?

111
00:06:38,271 --> 00:06:39,892
Okay, this is a little freaky.

112
00:06:39,969 --> 00:06:41,969
I don't see you looking
in the want ads.

113
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:47,793
You know, I had a job, Mom, and looking
back on the whole experience, I've come
to the conclusion that it's just not for me.

114
00:06:47,823 --> 00:06:49,770
-I'm done with the job thing.
-I'm sorry, Reese...

115
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,038
But not working isn't
one of your options.

116
00:06:52,281 --> 00:06:53,994
Okay, I think I know
what's going on here.

117
00:06:54,024 --> 00:06:56,970
Now, look, I want you to know that
I'm not criticizing you and Dad.

118
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,926
You obviously don't mind wasting your
lives doing meaningless, repetitive
tasks for unappreciative bosses.

119
00:07:01,956 --> 00:07:02,921
I respect that.

120
00:07:03,435 --> 00:07:05,943
Do you mind telling me
what you intend to do?

121
00:07:06,536 --> 00:07:09,486
-I'd like to finish my cereal.
-All right, Reese, that's it!

122
00:07:09,674 --> 00:07:14,124
I am tired of fighting you
on this. Until you get a job,
this free ride is over.

123
00:07:16,356 --> 00:07:18,606
Is anyone else getting
a little tired of her?

124
00:07:52,588 --> 00:07:53,707
I'm sorry, Spiderman.

125
00:07:57,402 --> 00:07:58,943
Hey, where were you?
You missed it.

126
00:07:58,973 --> 00:08:02,905
Randy Gerber shoved an entire
Tater Tot up a ninth grader's nose.

127
00:08:03,113 --> 00:08:04,396
Oh, I forgot to tell you.

128
00:08:04,474 --> 00:08:06,952
Vicki and I are going to walk
over and get lunch at the mall.

129
00:08:06,982 --> 00:08:10,202
Malcolm, what are you doing?
We both agreed she's cheerleader scum.

130
00:08:10,232 --> 00:08:13,532
But that's before she made out with
me for an hour behind the gym.

131
00:08:13,557 --> 00:08:14,865
Shut up!

132
00:08:14,973 --> 00:08:16,907
I know. I can't believe it either.
And you know what else?

133
00:08:16,937 --> 00:08:20,608
She's sweet and kind
and smart. Really smart.

134
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:24,265
So the nasty, self-absorbed
shallow thing is just an act?

135
00:08:24,721 --> 00:08:25,731
Wow, she's good.

136
00:08:26,358 --> 00:08:27,809
Somebody's a little late.

137
00:08:27,811 --> 00:08:31,261
Sorry. My friends are having a raging
debate on glitter versus gloss.

138
00:08:31,307 --> 00:08:32,570
I couldn't just duck out of it.

139
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,650
Didn't Fermat's last
theorem settle that?

140
00:08:34,776 --> 00:08:35,617
He wishes.

141
00:08:38,414 --> 00:08:39,513
-Hey, guys.
-Hey.

142
00:08:39,912 --> 00:08:41,108
What's with the geek?

143
00:08:41,147 --> 00:08:43,347
I thought chem lab wasn't
till fifth period.

144
00:08:43,886 --> 00:08:46,736
Actually, Vicki and I are
going to the mall to get lunch.

145
00:08:47,899 --> 00:08:49,678
You are so funny.

146
00:08:57,864 --> 00:08:58,964
Come on, son, keep up.

147
00:08:59,677 --> 00:09:04,479
And remember, just because a person
is in a position of power, doesn't mean
you can let them intimidate you.

148
00:09:04,509 --> 00:09:07,566
Can't we just stick a potato in his
exhaust pipe like we did with your boss?

149
00:09:07,596 --> 00:09:08,746
There he is. Excuse me.

150
00:09:10,891 --> 00:09:13,155
-May I help you?
-You better talk to this guy.

151
00:09:13,163 --> 00:09:14,467
He's pretty steamed.

152
00:09:16,717 --> 00:09:20,287
I got a hole-in-one on the 18th
hole and I didn't get a free game.

153
00:09:20,296 --> 00:09:22,611
I remember you. Ball got stuck.

154
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:23,976
I thought we went over this.

155
00:09:24,006 --> 00:09:24,565
We did.

156
00:09:25,082 --> 00:09:28,500
But for some reason, I just wanted
to come over here and make sure.

157
00:09:29,334 --> 00:09:32,134
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
My son is not done with you yet.

158
00:09:32,189 --> 00:09:33,339
Go on, tell him, Dewey.

159
00:09:34,386 --> 00:09:35,408
I have friends.

160
00:09:36,263 --> 00:09:36,996
Excuse me?

161
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:38,556
I have friends.

162
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:44,717
Friends who don't mind driving an extra
30 miles to the next miniature golf course,
even if it does have a crow problem.

163
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,910
-Are you threatening me?
-Boy. Sure sounds like he is to me.

164
00:09:48,429 --> 00:09:50,782
Listen, kid,
your ball didn't ring the bell.

165
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:52,982
Ball doesn't ring a bell,
no free game.

166
00:09:53,237 --> 00:09:56,131
And yet the boy feels like
he got a hole-in-one.

167
00:09:56,150 --> 00:10:00,380
Listen, if you want to think you got a
hole-in-one, I'll give you a scorecard.

168
00:10:00,441 --> 00:10:02,641
You can give yourself
18 holes-in-one.

169
00:10:03,124 --> 00:10:03,819
Excuse me.

170
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:08,268
Dewey, no!

171
00:10:08,681 --> 00:10:11,806
Don't worry, I got him,
but I am not always going to be here!

172
00:10:12,435 --> 00:10:13,862
Come on. Calm down.

173
00:10:16,766 --> 00:10:20,007
Malcolm, what happened?
I thought we were meeting
at the bookstore last night.

174
00:10:20,037 --> 00:10:22,840
You actually expect me to show up after
the way you blew me off yesterday?

175
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:24,120
Please don't be that way.

176
00:10:24,384 --> 00:10:26,284
What happened yesterday
means nothing.

177
00:10:26,603 --> 00:10:28,874
What really matters is
how special you are to me.

178
00:10:28,904 --> 00:10:29,656
Special?

179
00:10:29,695 --> 00:10:33,895
Yes. I really want to be with
you, Malcolm. I just can't be
seen with you in public.

180
00:10:34,655 --> 00:10:36,623
What? Are you serious?

181
00:10:36,638 --> 00:10:38,616
You have to appreciate my situation.

182
00:10:39,061 --> 00:10:42,513
I'm incredibly popular.
I've been homecoming queen twice.

183
00:10:43,181 --> 00:10:46,881
And there's a certain image of me that
people here are really invested in.

184
00:10:47,243 --> 00:10:48,943
How do you think
this makes me feel?

185
00:10:48,973 --> 00:10:53,473
Look, nerdball, I have no idea
where the Math Club meets.
Did you lose your laminated map?

186
00:10:55,101 --> 00:10:58,690
All that matters is that you
know how crazy I am about you.

187
00:10:59,037 --> 00:11:00,619
I think it's really romantic.

188
00:11:00,821 --> 00:11:02,325
It's like Romeo and Juliet.

189
00:11:02,573 --> 00:11:04,077
Our love has to be hidden.

190
00:11:04,138 --> 00:11:06,160
-I'm not hiding it.
-I wish you would.

191
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:12,189
So what you're saying is you
can't be seen with me in the
cafeteria or the quad or at dances.

192
00:11:12,193 --> 00:11:12,730
Or at games.

193
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:16,457
I can only see you someplace
where, God forbid, we won't
run into any of your friends?

194
00:11:16,487 --> 00:11:17,167
Right!

195
00:11:21,339 --> 00:11:22,014
Okay.

196
00:11:31,275 --> 00:11:32,925
That breakfast looks pretty good.

197
00:11:33,282 --> 00:11:34,439
Yeah, it is.

198
00:11:35,001 --> 00:11:37,650
You want to do me a favor and
go stink it up someplace else?

199
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,186
How do you think I feel?
I have to smell me all the time.

200
00:11:40,216 --> 00:11:42,016
Look, I've been
having a tough week.

201
00:11:42,758 --> 00:11:44,879
Is there any chance you
could lend me a couple bucks?

202
00:11:44,909 --> 00:11:46,990
Oh, sorry.
I don't have my wallet on me.

203
00:11:47,184 --> 00:11:48,273
I'll catch you next time.

204
00:11:48,303 --> 00:11:49,003
God bless you.

205
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:55,254
You know, Dewey, what Reese is doing
is pointless and idiotic, but I think you
can really learn something from him.

206
00:11:55,284 --> 00:11:58,534
This is what it looks like when
someone stands up for themselves.

207
00:11:58,557 --> 00:12:00,157
I didn't get the
free game, Dad.

208
00:12:00,367 --> 00:12:02,717
I accept that we don't
always get what we want.

209
00:12:03,111 --> 00:12:06,011
Being part of this family has
really prepared me for that.

210
00:12:06,296 --> 00:12:07,846
Listen, do me a favor, will ya?

211
00:12:07,851 --> 00:12:08,901
Talk to your brother.

212
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:10,511
I'll see what I can do.

213
00:12:10,944 --> 00:12:13,944
Do you think you could help a
guy a little down on his luck?

214
00:12:14,217 --> 00:12:14,777
Here.

215
00:12:15,275 --> 00:12:16,425
Don't tell your mother.

216
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:19,933
<i>Smells like a dead squirrel's
in the wall again. Hal...</i>

217
00:12:20,402 --> 00:12:25,088
Oh, my God, it's you.
Reese, you smell like an open sewer.

218
00:12:25,096 --> 00:12:26,225
And whose fault is that?

219
00:12:26,255 --> 00:12:29,651
Yours. All you have to do to
stop this nonsense is get a job.

220
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:32,790
Excuse me, but I think I've
made it pretty clear where
I stand on that issue.

221
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,620
Well, you can't stay here like this.

222
00:12:34,662 --> 00:12:35,704
Is that an apology?

223
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:38,419
No, it's an invitation
to live in the backyard.

224
00:12:38,426 --> 00:12:40,368
Listen to yourself! You don't
even sound the least bit guilty.

225
00:12:40,398 --> 00:12:42,153
I've given you enough chances.

226
00:12:42,312 --> 00:12:43,045
Out!

227
00:12:44,093 --> 00:12:48,043
Okay, but if the cats start disappearing
from the neighborhood, don't blame me!

228
00:12:49,801 --> 00:12:51,797
Things are going better
than ever with Vicki.

229
00:12:51,827 --> 00:12:55,169
We went on a picnic, to the movies,
and she even lets me ride in her car...

230
00:12:55,199 --> 00:12:56,749
as long as I keep my head down.

231
00:12:58,246 --> 00:13:02,505
Oh, by the way, I was able to
get out of that student council
meeting, so I'm free after school.

232
00:13:02,535 --> 00:13:04,235
Hey, great.
I was thinking that...

233
00:13:04,832 --> 00:13:10,759
the hydroxide ions necessary for the
neutralization must be supplied by a
weak base such as ammonium hydroxide.

234
00:13:11,222 --> 00:13:16,216
What is with you, freak? Every time
I turn around you're hounding Vicki
about that stupid experiment.

235
00:13:16,246 --> 00:13:17,404
Is he bothering you?

236
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,693
Yeah, kind of.

237
00:13:20,931 --> 00:13:22,070
Leave Vicki alone.

238
00:13:22,436 --> 00:13:23,632
Okay, butt-wipe?

239
00:13:33,042 --> 00:13:35,254
You know,
I was kind of skeptical at first,

240
00:13:35,636 --> 00:13:38,686
but now I see what you two
have is really beautiful.

241
00:13:43,569 --> 00:13:46,019
Oh, no, you don't!

242
00:13:48,319 --> 00:13:49,204
Reese!

243
00:13:49,387 --> 00:13:50,281
Okay, what now?

244
00:13:50,328 --> 00:13:52,606
What on earth do you
think you're doing?

245
00:13:52,656 --> 00:13:54,265
We're testing out our
new heating system.

246
00:13:54,295 --> 00:13:56,627
I think it's going to be
a very comfortable winter.

247
00:13:56,657 --> 00:13:59,959
Hi. Lloyd Johnson.
I'm an associate of your son's.

248
00:13:59,982 --> 00:14:02,282
Get out of here before
I turn the hose on you.

249
00:14:02,534 --> 00:14:05,659
You can't treat Lloyd like that after
what the CIA did to his brain waves.

250
00:14:05,689 --> 00:14:08,737
Reese, I want you to get this
eyesore out of here right now.

251
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:13,411
Eyesore? That is a sub-zero box.
It's a hell of a lot nicer than
anything we've ever thrown out.

252
00:14:13,441 --> 00:14:15,591
All right, you won't
get rid of it, I will.

253
00:14:21,064 --> 00:14:23,276
I could've told you those
boxes are reinforced.

254
00:14:23,306 --> 00:14:25,664
With some curtains and a couple of
plants, it was going to look very nice.

255
00:14:25,694 --> 00:14:27,994
Oh, just shut up and help
me get in the house!

256
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:32,690
Look, Vicki...

257
00:14:33,988 --> 00:14:35,088
I know, I know, but...

258
00:14:35,212 --> 00:14:38,262
It's a school dance,
so my being there shouldn't be an issue.

259
00:14:38,771 --> 00:14:39,981
No, no, I know.

260
00:14:40,495 --> 00:14:42,045
Of course it'll fool everybody.

261
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:45,260
But I just think it's kind of
weird that you got me a date.

262
00:14:45,442 --> 00:14:48,892
I don't even like Cindy that much and,
you know, I want to be with...

263
00:14:49,064 --> 00:14:50,162
What'd you do that for?

264
00:14:50,192 --> 00:14:51,926
Consider this an
intervention, Malcolm.

265
00:14:51,956 --> 00:14:54,292
I'm declaring you incompetent
to run your own love life.

266
00:14:54,322 --> 00:14:55,672
What are you talking about?

267
00:14:55,768 --> 00:14:57,842
Vicki and I have this
incredible relationship.

268
00:14:57,872 --> 00:15:00,670
There are worlds inside that
I have yet to discover.

269
00:15:00,786 --> 00:15:02,290
And I know she feels
the same way about me.

270
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,586
Really? Is that why she
threw a soda can at you?

271
00:15:04,616 --> 00:15:06,775
That was my fault.
I wasn't supposed to be in the quad.

272
00:15:06,805 --> 00:15:08,657
Malcolm, you deserve better.

273
00:15:09,118 --> 00:15:12,542
I mean, there are lots of girls
who'd be proud to actually be
seen with you in public.

274
00:15:12,572 --> 00:15:13,622
Oh, really? Like Who?

275
00:15:15,342 --> 00:15:16,133
Like me.

276
00:15:18,238 --> 00:15:18,798
What?

277
00:15:19,174 --> 00:15:19,676
But...

278
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:23,216
But all we do is
fight all the time.

279
00:15:25,006 --> 00:15:26,530
Figure it out, genius.

280
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:36,333
Here's some ice
for your back, Mom.

281
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:38,181
There.

282
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:42,204
I also made you some soup 'cause I
figured you might get hungry later.

283
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:45,290
You know, really hungry.

284
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:46,949
No, I'm okay now, Reese.

285
00:15:48,304 --> 00:15:50,878
Well, I'm going to go back outside
and bang out the dents in my bedroom.

286
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:51,564
Reese?

287
00:15:53,896 --> 00:15:57,523
You should move your box
closer to the garage. You'll
be out of the wind that way.

288
00:15:57,553 --> 00:15:58,093
Thanks.

289
00:15:59,100 --> 00:15:59,800
Wait a minute.

290
00:16:01,412 --> 00:16:04,142
I really appreciate you helping me out.
If there's anything you need...

291
00:16:04,172 --> 00:16:04,693
I'm fine.

292
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:09,033
I found a mattress in the alley and
Lloyd's going to let me hang with him
tomorrow at his freeway off-ramp.

293
00:16:09,063 --> 00:16:12,263
Well, I was going to say if you
wanted my soup you could have...

294
00:16:12,652 --> 00:16:16,252
As long as you're not going to eat it,
'cause I can take it or leave it.

295
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:22,783
Malcolm, where have you been?

296
00:16:22,813 --> 00:16:25,187
Cindy has just been sitting
there bored out of her mind.

297
00:16:25,217 --> 00:16:25,729
Yeah.

298
00:16:26,441 --> 00:16:27,791
I'm not going to the dance.

299
00:16:28,407 --> 00:16:30,910
I'm just here to tell you I don't
think we should see each other anymore.

300
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:34,303
I thought things were going really
great between us. Would you mind
moving over behind that plant?

301
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:36,338
No, I'm not hiding
anymore, Vicki.

302
00:16:36,584 --> 00:16:40,410
You may not realize it, but there
are girls who would be thrilled
to be seen with me in public.

303
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,514
Malcolm, please...

304
00:16:41,862 --> 00:16:42,612
I think that...

305
00:16:42,827 --> 00:16:46,673
Hey, Vicki, that Huzbat kid is
dancing again. It's hilarious.

306
00:16:48,194 --> 00:16:49,236
What's going on?

307
00:16:51,782 --> 00:16:53,232
I'll be with you in a moment.

308
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:57,375
Malcolm, I know this has
been really difficult for you.

309
00:16:57,405 --> 00:16:59,688
It's just a lab experiment, okay?

310
00:17:00,085 --> 00:17:02,091
Just give it a little more time.

311
00:17:02,134 --> 00:17:02,994
Things will get better.

312
00:17:03,024 --> 00:17:06,674
I don't care if the cobalt crystals
aren't dissolving, it's Friday night.

313
00:17:07,096 --> 00:17:09,049
Just give me another chance.

314
00:17:10,634 --> 00:17:12,207
Forget it, Vicki. It's over.

315
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,290
Whatever!

316
00:17:23,587 --> 00:17:24,892
Can't I at least go back to bed?

317
00:17:24,922 --> 00:17:27,872
I'd say yes if I thought you
could live with yourself, son.

318
00:17:28,512 --> 00:17:29,245
No.

319
00:17:29,566 --> 00:17:31,572
We are going to get
you your free game.

320
00:17:31,802 --> 00:17:36,664
This is the moment of truth and
we can stand tall knowing we
have the moral high ground.

321
00:17:37,127 --> 00:17:39,127
Now lift the fence so
I can crawl under.

322
00:17:40,167 --> 00:17:41,817
<i>That's it, now line it up.</i>

323
00:17:42,367 --> 00:17:43,833
And easy with the backswing.

324
00:17:44,026 --> 00:17:45,415
Dad, this is ridiculous.

325
00:17:45,607 --> 00:17:46,765
I can't see a thing.

326
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:50,238
All right, Dewey,
I am tired of your attitude.

327
00:17:50,344 --> 00:17:52,736
Now you are owed a fun time.

328
00:17:52,786 --> 00:17:57,232
And if you're not having fun,
then we're just a couple of idiots
playing miniature golf at midnight!

329
00:17:57,262 --> 00:17:58,819
Okay, you want to have fun?

330
00:17:58,938 --> 00:17:59,957
Let's have fun.

331
00:18:03,062 --> 00:18:03,480
Great.

332
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,119
The ball is stuck in there now.

333
00:18:05,149 --> 00:18:05,608
Good.

334
00:18:05,632 --> 00:18:08,162
No, no, no, no.
We are not quitting that easily.

335
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:13,310
Look, son, I know you're angry but
if you're really honest with yourself,
you'll realize you're not mad at me.

336
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,648
It sure feels like I am.

337
00:18:14,652 --> 00:18:17,687
No, you are mad at the
jerk that runs this place.

338
00:18:18,069 --> 00:18:27,377
Bet he's at home right now sitting in his
barcalounger with a big bowl of popcorn
on his lap chuckling at us with the boobs that he...

339
00:18:27,867 --> 00:18:29,167
<i>Hey. What was that?</i>

340
00:18:29,927 --> 00:18:30,583
Hey, Dewey...

341
00:18:30,897 --> 00:18:32,330
The door's locked.
What's going on?

342
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:35,910
I told you I was happy without my
free game, but you wouldn't listen.

343
00:18:35,932 --> 00:18:36,338
Dewey!

344
00:18:36,739 --> 00:18:38,480
I'm your father. Let me out!

345
00:18:38,495 --> 00:18:42,627
Just because someone's in
a position of power, you can't
let them intimidate you, right?

346
00:18:42,657 --> 00:18:44,107
<i>Don't you walk away...</i>

347
00:18:44,177 --> 00:18:44,720
Dewey!

348
00:18:45,115 --> 00:18:45,809
Hey!

349
00:18:46,129 --> 00:18:48,112
You're standing up to me. Good boy!

350
00:18:48,934 --> 00:18:49,420
<i>Wait!</i>

351
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:50,720
That's all I wanted.

352
00:18:51,867 --> 00:18:53,990
<i>Hey, what's this? Raccoons.</i>

353
00:18:55,752 --> 00:18:59,653
<i>Dewey! Don't you even care that your
father is being eaten by raccoons?!</i>

354
00:18:59,683 --> 00:19:00,346
Help!

355
00:19:01,259 --> 00:19:01,876
I did it!

356
00:19:02,879 --> 00:19:04,129
I told Vicki it was over.

357
00:19:04,212 --> 00:19:05,293
And it felt so good.

358
00:19:06,393 --> 00:19:08,834
Wow, that's great, Malcolm.

359
00:19:09,521 --> 00:19:12,471
To be honest, I didn't think
you had the strength to do it.

360
00:19:12,729 --> 00:19:13,655
So that's it.

361
00:19:14,701 --> 00:19:15,731
Now we're free to be together.

362
00:19:15,761 --> 00:19:16,318
Yeah.

363
00:19:17,129 --> 00:19:18,733
You know,
there's just one problem.

364
00:19:18,763 --> 00:19:20,813
I don't feel that way
about you, Malcolm.

365
00:19:21,564 --> 00:19:22,212
What?

366
00:19:23,401 --> 00:19:25,949
-But what about what you said?
-Yeah, I lied about that.

367
00:19:25,979 --> 00:19:28,779
I just couldn't stand to see
someone make a fool of you.

368
00:19:29,384 --> 00:19:30,784
Someone besides me, that is.

369
00:19:31,539 --> 00:19:32,080
But...

370
00:19:32,832 --> 00:19:33,295
Great.

371
00:19:34,429 --> 00:19:37,422
I just blew off Vicki, and now
I'm left standing here looking
like a complete idiot.

372
00:19:37,452 --> 00:19:38,691
But you recognize it.

373
00:19:39,101 --> 00:19:40,432
See, you're getting better already.

374
00:19:40,462 --> 00:19:42,412
You're so sure of yourself, aren't you?

375
00:19:43,011 --> 00:19:45,990
Well, the truth is, I didn't need you.
I could've figured this out on my own.

376
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:49,375
Yeah, sometime after your secret
marriage and three secret kids.

377
00:19:49,408 --> 00:19:50,237
Shut up.

378
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:52,465
Look, Malcolm, I'm on your side.

379
00:19:54,558 --> 00:19:57,808
I mean, do you really think I just
hang out with you out of pity?

380
00:19:59,328 --> 00:20:01,643
You're an amazing...

381
00:20:02,087 --> 00:20:04,093
complicated guy who's...

382
00:20:05,142 --> 00:20:06,719
always surprising me.

383
00:20:08,237 --> 00:20:10,787
I mean, who knows where
things could go between us.

384
00:20:16,912 --> 00:20:17,612
Yeah, nothing.

385
00:20:17,876 --> 00:20:18,876
Good night, Malcolm.

386
00:20:23,185 --> 00:20:25,703
Okay, the heating pad's
plugged in, here's your aspirin.

387
00:20:25,733 --> 00:20:27,833
And let me know if you
need anything else.

388
00:20:28,489 --> 00:20:30,230
I'm really sorry
about your back, Mom.

389
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:31,283
Thank you, Reese.

390
00:20:31,586 --> 00:20:33,188
I'm still angry with you.

391
00:20:33,827 --> 00:20:35,727
But you've really
come through for me.

392
00:20:36,372 --> 00:20:40,727
Your blankets and new sheets
are in the trunk of my car.
You can move back in if you want.

393
00:20:40,757 --> 00:20:41,615
Thanks, Mom.

394
00:20:42,171 --> 00:20:42,962
I'd like that.

395
00:20:47,225 --> 00:20:47,920
<i>Reese!</i>

396
00:20:48,602 --> 00:20:49,606
<i>Reese!</i>

397
00:20:50,167 --> 00:20:52,063
<i>Get in here, do you hear me?!</i>

398
00:20:53,275 --> 00:20:54,973
What's the matter with you?

399
00:20:55,031 --> 00:20:55,976
Are you deaf?

400
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:58,123
<i>It's time for my sponge bath.</i>

401
00:20:58,568 --> 00:21:01,818
You think these stomach folds are
going to scrape themselves out?

402
00:21:06,205 --> 00:21:09,479
I'm going to get a job. I'm going to
have a life of my own away from here.

403
00:21:09,509 --> 00:21:12,577
And just in case I don't, you can
clean out your own damn stomach folds!

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
