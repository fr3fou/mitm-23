1
00:00:04,831 --> 00:00:07,118
-Eat faster!
-Don't chew it. Just swallow it!

2
00:00:09,874 --> 00:00:10,538
Nothing.

3
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:16,779
Granted, this isn't scientific, but
the fact that Reese can't get brain
freeze has to prove something.

4
00:00:17,096 --> 00:00:17,682
Wait.

5
00:00:18,943 --> 00:00:20,741
I'm feeling
something in my toes.

6
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:29,940

9
00:00:57,881 --> 00:01:01,564
-We did it! We finally got back
at Tim Schwab and his brother.
-What'd you do?

10
00:01:01,594 --> 00:01:04,191
We found a dead octopus in a
dumpster at the seafood store.

11
00:01:04,221 --> 00:01:07,846
We shoved its mouth full of
medical waste and put it in
the Schwabs' air conditioner.

12
00:01:07,876 --> 00:01:09,862
That'll teach them to
say we're obnoxious.

13
00:01:09,892 --> 00:01:11,152
Why didn't you let me help?

14
00:01:11,182 --> 00:01:12,090
It couldn't wait, Dewey.

15
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:16,389
With a dead octopus, there's a very
small window before it starts smelling
like just another dead fish.

16
00:01:16,419 --> 00:01:18,355
Reese, your hands still stink.

17
00:01:18,872 --> 00:01:19,569
Yeah...

18
00:01:20,808 --> 00:01:22,704
Like victory.

19
00:01:23,967 --> 00:01:26,782
We can't take a walk without
our jackets anymore, Jamie.

20
00:01:27,153 --> 00:01:28,865
It's the first cool day of fall.

21
00:01:29,113 --> 00:01:33,921
Fall reminds adults about our mortality,
but for you, it's just pretty leaves.

22
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:35,979
Hmm. What's this?

23
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:43,999
You're telling me my family's
hasn't had health insurance
for the last six months?!

24
00:01:44,015 --> 00:01:46,047
Yes, I know you
never got the check!

25
00:01:46,298 --> 00:01:48,311
There must be some
sort of grace period.

26
00:01:49,655 --> 00:01:53,055
And when those two months are over,
what's the grace period on that?

27
00:01:53,484 --> 00:01:56,846
No, no, you can't wait until
Monday to reinstate us.

28
00:01:56,924 --> 00:02:00,074
We can't go through the whole
weekend without health insurance.

29
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:04,592
Listen, listen, I am speaking to you
from a house full of walking time bombs.

30
00:02:05,812 --> 00:02:08,920
Well, then you're just a bunch
of lousy, heartless bastards!

31
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,011
-Who you talking to?
-March of Dimes.

32
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:14,132
I've got to go to work early.
Hattie's called another secret
meeting about the union.

33
00:02:14,162 --> 00:02:15,778
-Uh-uh.
-Goodbye.

34
00:02:16,964 --> 00:02:17,961
Bye, hon.

35
00:02:19,012 --> 00:02:19,871
Listen, Jim.

36
00:02:20,169 --> 00:02:21,186
Can I call you Jim?

37
00:02:21,826 --> 00:02:22,940
Oh, okay, Steven.

38
00:02:23,397 --> 00:02:24,497
Let me level with you.

39
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:27,551
Six months ago my wife asked
me to do one thing. One.

40
00:02:27,825 --> 00:02:29,896
I was supposed to
mail your check.

41
00:02:29,991 --> 00:02:32,122
The woman relies on
the fact that I can be

42
00:02:32,172 --> 00:02:35,592
occasionally trusted to perform
very simple menial tasks.

43
00:02:35,631 --> 00:02:39,808
Now, if you don't start my insurance,
and if anything happens to anyone
in this family,

44
00:02:39,838 --> 00:02:44,810
I am gonna have to explain to her
that her entire life is built on a lie!

45
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:51,786
Well, I just hope that when your
marriage blows up in your face,
I'm there to see it!

46
00:02:55,687 --> 00:03:00,146
Okay, Jamie, for the next two
days there's no getting sick.
There's no getting owies.

47
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:05,220
All of the safety rules your mother
and I told you about, well, starting
today, we mean them.

48
00:03:09,427 --> 00:03:11,558
Hi, I'm Connie Guzman, Teddy's mother.

49
00:03:11,597 --> 00:03:13,444
I guess our little guys are gonna
have a play date this morning.

50
00:03:13,474 --> 00:03:14,750
Oh, right.

51
00:03:15,004 --> 00:03:15,779
I'm, I'm Hal.

52
00:03:15,896 --> 00:03:18,231
I was so relieved we could
schedule something today.

53
00:03:18,261 --> 00:03:19,661
I've got a killer day ahead.

54
00:03:20,973 --> 00:03:21,911
What was that?

55
00:03:21,998 --> 00:03:23,464
It was just his allergies.

56
00:03:24,392 --> 00:03:25,311
Allergies?

57
00:03:25,754 --> 00:03:26,789
Or disease?

58
00:03:28,671 --> 00:03:31,016
There are a lot of
viruses going around.

59
00:03:31,087 --> 00:03:33,737
Some of these kids are
nothing but walking germ bags.

60
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:38,159
He seems a little unresponsive.

61
00:03:38,195 --> 00:03:39,895
Is Jamie's mother home?

62
00:03:39,933 --> 00:03:42,413
Boy, I do not like the
way this gland feels.

63
00:03:42,762 --> 00:03:44,812
What did his poop look
like this morning?

64
00:03:45,565 --> 00:03:46,639
Mommy...

65
00:03:46,969 --> 00:03:49,660
You know, I'm not sure Teddy's
up for a play date today.

66
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:51,966
-Oh, Jamie will be so disappointed.
-Come on, Teddy.

67
00:03:51,996 --> 00:03:54,558
-You're going to Mommy's job interview.
-We'll do it again some other time.

68
00:03:54,588 --> 00:03:56,988
Just make sure you bring
a note from his doctor.

69
00:04:04,546 --> 00:04:07,669
What are you doing?!
This is not a toy!

70
00:04:08,425 --> 00:04:10,550
I didn't think I was cutting
my bagel with a toy.

71
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:11,792
This is plenty sharp.

72
00:04:12,707 --> 00:04:13,309
Wait!

73
00:04:14,678 --> 00:04:15,264
Here.

74
00:04:16,559 --> 00:04:17,896
And use the handle.

75
00:04:28,603 --> 00:04:30,596
I'm living in a death house.

76
00:04:32,082 --> 00:04:35,932
And that's why I propose we affiliate
ourselves with the Teamsters.

77
00:04:36,064 --> 00:04:39,874
They can deliver a benefits
package that's quite substantial.

78
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:42,865
It's all spelled out
in this literature.

79
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,730
Well, I think this
is a bad idea.

80
00:04:44,859 --> 00:04:45,875
Bad, bad, bad!

81
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:47,592
Craig, it can't hurt
to just listen.

82
00:04:47,622 --> 00:04:51,052
When Mr. Cochran finds out we're
talking union, we'll lose all our perks.

83
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:51,844
What perks?

84
00:04:51,941 --> 00:04:54,006
We get to wear the
smocks on our days off.

85
00:04:54,036 --> 00:04:57,336
And they're talking about fixing
the hand dryer in the men's room.

86
00:04:58,121 --> 00:05:00,805
I just want to thank Hattie
for organizing this meeting.

87
00:05:00,835 --> 00:05:05,935
I think it's about time the people
who really do the work around
here start standing up for ourselves.

88
00:05:05,946 --> 00:05:09,191
I for one, am sick of no
overtime, no job security...

89
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:14,145
Excuse me, Joe, I just want to
say that Mr. Cochran makes
a lot more money than us.

90
00:05:14,203 --> 00:05:17,553
And I strongly feel that on that
basis alone, he should be trusted.

91
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,481
Oh, for God's sake, Craig.

92
00:05:19,718 --> 00:05:21,318
You know what
really bothers me?

93
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,460
When I see Mr. Cochran parking
his car out front every morning and
we've got to park nine blocks away.

94
00:05:26,808 --> 00:05:30,608
-They let us use the shuttle
to get to our cars.
-That's the city bus, Craig.

95
00:05:30,894 --> 00:05:34,824
I appreciate all the anger that's in
this room, and God knows I'm not one

96
00:05:34,828 --> 00:05:39,095
to shy away from a fight, but I suggest
that instead of starting a union,

97
00:05:39,173 --> 00:05:44,653
we form a special committee to
maybe paint Mr. Cochran's house
so he'll want to be nice to us.

98
00:05:45,464 --> 00:05:47,653
Sit down and shut up, Feldspar.

99
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:49,173
You know what?

100
00:05:49,664 --> 00:05:51,510
I've worked here for
almost ten years.

101
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:57,379
I have never felt we needed a union,
but when I think about what this place
has done to some of us,

102
00:05:57,748 --> 00:06:02,866
how it's made us so afraid to even voice
our opinions, then I think maybe we do.

103
00:06:06,518 --> 00:06:11,749
Okay, but let the record show
that I advocated a policy of
cowardice and appeasement.

104
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:17,876
Oh. Come here.

105
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:19,205
Hi.

106
00:07:20,783 --> 00:07:21,447
Okay.

107
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,657
Hattie's still holding these secret
union meetings during our breaks.

108
00:07:26,687 --> 00:07:27,879
It's so complicated.

109
00:07:27,957 --> 00:07:30,649
We would have to pay dues,
but we'd save on health insurance.

110
00:07:30,679 --> 00:07:33,229
Oh, really? How fast would
we get health insurance?

111
00:07:33,546 --> 00:07:36,623
Hattie thinks we can start serious
talks with the Teamsters next month.

112
00:07:36,653 --> 00:07:37,982
Oh, who cares?

113
00:07:38,557 --> 00:07:39,984
Boys, breakfast.

114
00:07:42,509 --> 00:07:43,959
Hal, where are all the forks?

115
00:07:44,271 --> 00:07:48,961
Oh, uh, they were all bent out of
shape so I sent them out to that
guy who fixes them.

116
00:07:50,486 --> 00:07:51,952
The "fork straightener"?

117
00:07:52,316 --> 00:07:54,748
It's the man's work, Lois.
I don't think we should make fun.

118
00:07:54,778 --> 00:07:57,828
Hal, how are the boys gonna eat
scrambled eggs without forks?

119
00:08:03,652 --> 00:08:04,571
I have to go.

120
00:08:05,185 --> 00:08:07,374
Honey, you know
what's a great look?

121
00:08:07,452 --> 00:08:13,352
I saw this gal the other day, had a bike
helmet, and I thought, "Why the heck
can't women look this good all the time?"

122
00:08:13,507 --> 00:08:15,259
Oh, baby.

123
00:08:15,268 --> 00:08:17,020
Hal, you're messing up my hair.

124
00:08:17,137 --> 00:08:19,337
Okay, look, just buckle
up and drive slowly.

125
00:08:19,438 --> 00:08:21,099
Get there late, but get there!

126
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:28,898
Let this be a lesson
to every one of you.

127
00:08:31,206 --> 00:08:33,920
-What's going on with Hattie?
-Cochran fired her this morning.

128
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:36,580
He said it was for dressing
provocatively, but he
obviously found out

129
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:38,123
that she's been calling
the union meetings.

130
00:08:38,153 --> 00:08:39,131
That's horrible.

131
00:08:39,342 --> 00:08:41,792
Somebody around here's
been snitching to Cochran.

132
00:08:50,703 --> 00:08:52,884
Craig, is there something
you want to tell me?

133
00:08:52,914 --> 00:08:54,204
No, no, not really.

134
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:00,691
Why won't you look
me in the eye?

135
00:09:00,991 --> 00:09:02,641
Why won't you look
me in the eye?

136
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,683
I can play this game as
long as you can, Lois.

137
00:09:14,907 --> 00:09:16,353
I'll be watching you, Craig.

138
00:09:16,646 --> 00:09:17,487
Nice cover.

139
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:23,654
Oh, my God!

140
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:25,949
What is it?

141
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:28,758
The Schwabs sent out a mass
e-mail to everyone at school.

142
00:09:28,788 --> 00:09:30,622
They Photoshopped our
heads onto a dirty movie.

143
00:09:30,652 --> 00:09:31,727
Gross!

144
00:09:31,982 --> 00:09:34,882
That can't be a dirty movie.
There aren't any girls in it.

145
00:09:36,143 --> 00:09:37,530
Oh, my God!

146
00:09:37,667 --> 00:09:38,617
I'm not homophobic.

147
00:09:38,627 --> 00:09:40,903
If the three of us were gay
lovers, I'd be fine with this.

148
00:09:40,933 --> 00:09:41,833
But it's not true!

149
00:09:41,878 --> 00:09:43,186
This is so humiliating.

150
00:09:43,477 --> 00:09:45,343
My abs are way more
ripped than that guy's.

151
00:09:45,373 --> 00:09:47,171
We've got to respond.

152
00:09:47,495 --> 00:09:50,966
Well, I was saving this one to what
grade Mr. Watts was going to give me,

153
00:09:50,996 --> 00:09:54,453
but we can climb up on their roof and
drop a wasp nest down their chimney.

154
00:09:54,483 --> 00:09:55,333
I have one ready.

155
00:09:55,421 --> 00:09:57,445
I've been teasing the for
months to keep them angry.

156
00:09:57,475 --> 00:09:58,081
Perfect.

157
00:09:59,542 --> 00:10:02,239
What does it take to
keep you boys safe?

158
00:10:02,396 --> 00:10:03,875
Dad, you don't know
what the Schwabs did.

159
00:10:03,905 --> 00:10:05,318
I don't care what they did!

160
00:10:05,358 --> 00:10:06,686
What is the matter
with you boys?

161
00:10:06,716 --> 00:10:08,716
Don't you realize you
could get killed?!

162
00:10:09,179 --> 00:10:10,479
Dad, I'm not going to die.

163
00:10:10,897 --> 00:10:12,402
-What?
-I'm 17.

164
00:10:13,532 --> 00:10:15,056
And so you can't die?

165
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:17,021
I just don't see it happening.

166
00:10:17,051 --> 00:10:20,354
I've got news for you, Reese.
17-year-olds die all the time.

167
00:10:20,367 --> 00:10:21,813
Oh, come on, Dad.

168
00:10:21,911 --> 00:10:23,945
That's just something they tell
you so you'll stay off drugs.

169
00:10:23,975 --> 00:10:24,753
That's it!

170
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:27,607
You're all grounded in your
room for the rest of weekend!

171
00:10:27,646 --> 00:10:28,649
You can't do that!

172
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,980
I know I'm gonna die, Dad.

173
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:33,957
Nobody is dying in this family until
the start of business Monday morning!

174
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:45,976
Okay, should there be an actual fire,
I think we'll be in pretty good shape.

175
00:10:50,476 --> 00:10:51,348
Did you hear?

176
00:10:51,547 --> 00:10:52,753
We did a little investigating.

177
00:10:52,783 --> 00:10:54,633
We found out who
Cochran's snitch is.

178
00:10:54,723 --> 00:10:55,974
-Oh, no...
-It's Joe.

179
00:10:57,043 --> 00:10:57,864
Joe?

180
00:10:58,089 --> 00:10:59,889
-What about Craig?
-What about Craig?

181
00:10:59,966 --> 00:11:03,836
Uh, does Craig know
that it's Joe?

182
00:11:03,935 --> 00:11:04,795
Everybody knows.

183
00:11:04,911 --> 00:11:08,561
Cochran just promoted Joe to manager.
We're going to go congratulate him.

184
00:11:08,889 --> 00:11:10,189
Can you hand me some soap?

185
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:11,274
Sure.

186
00:11:13,635 --> 00:11:15,941
Wow, I had it completely wrong.

187
00:11:23,824 --> 00:11:26,624
<i>Did you get any information
I asked for, Felspar.</i>

188
00:11:27,573 --> 00:11:31,814
<i>Yes, sir. Lois almost caught me, but
I can assure you our secret is safe.</i>

189
00:11:32,467 --> 00:11:36,450
<i>Good, good, excellent.
Now you've gotta tell me everything.</i>

190
00:11:37,101 --> 00:11:38,201
<i>Of course, sir.</i>

191
00:11:38,578 --> 00:11:41,178
<i>I'll need a complete
list of names thise.</i>

192
00:11:41,422 --> 00:11:42,732
They're all here.

193
00:11:42,771 --> 00:11:45,371
<i>Just please, sir,
make sure this stays quiet.</i>

194
00:11:45,398 --> 00:11:46,668
Don't worry about it.

195
00:11:47,284 --> 00:11:48,437
Thank you, Mr. Cochran.

196
00:11:48,691 --> 00:11:51,241
Looks and brains, you're
the complete package, sir!

197
00:11:53,997 --> 00:11:56,871
What the hell are you doing
talking with Mr Cochran, Craig.

198
00:11:56,901 --> 00:12:01,600
Okay, Lois. If you can tell me what
you think you saw, that would really
help me focus my answer.

199
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:03,380
You grabbed hair! You grabbed hair!

200
00:12:05,218 --> 00:12:07,668
Craig, I heard you talking
about a list of names.

201
00:12:07,996 --> 00:12:09,091
Oh, that. Um.

202
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:11,573
We were just rating all
the hottie in the store.

203
00:12:11,603 --> 00:12:14,710
Don't worry. You're holding your
own in both posture and dimples.

204
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:17,281
-You expect me to fall for that?
-I'd appreciated.

205
00:12:17,584 --> 00:12:19,167
Craig how could you?

206
00:12:20,124 --> 00:12:22,157
<i>Get away from me, you animals!</i>

207
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:23,986
Oh, my God. Joe.

208
00:12:27,883 --> 00:12:28,860
Stop!

209
00:12:29,234 --> 00:12:31,794
Stay out of this, Lois.
This is retail justice.

210
00:12:32,392 --> 00:12:33,330
Pull it off.

211
00:12:34,228 --> 00:12:36,808
But you're making a mistake.
Joe isn't the snitch!

212
00:12:37,204 --> 00:12:37,790
What?!

213
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:41,010
The real snitch just
confessed to me.

214
00:12:41,269 --> 00:12:43,897
-Who is it?
-I'm not going to tell you.
I don't want you hurting him.

215
00:12:43,927 --> 00:12:47,077
-He's a misguided, weak,
pathetic individual who...
-It's Craig!

216
00:12:49,012 --> 00:12:49,755
Wait!

217
00:12:53,513 --> 00:12:55,764
Dad, why are you doing this?

218
00:12:57,604 --> 00:13:00,554
We're gonna call child welfare,
and this time they'll come.

219
00:13:04,824 --> 00:13:07,374
Please don't do this, Dad!
It's just not necessary.

220
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:12,520
There. Now we can finally have a
nice safe week-end around here.

221
00:13:15,456 --> 00:13:16,257
Let's do it.

222
00:13:22,641 --> 00:13:26,041
I told you this was worth spending
Christmas vacation at Home Depot.

223
00:13:26,137 --> 00:13:28,837
Wait. Dad's gonna kill us
when he realizes we're gone.

224
00:13:29,753 --> 00:13:33,662
Maybe we can just pretend
we're too secure to care what
the Schwabs think of us.

225
00:13:33,692 --> 00:13:34,923
Nobody's gonna buy that.

226
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:36,604
We can't let this stand, Dewey.

227
00:13:36,661 --> 00:13:40,469
Remember the day everybody started
calling Booger Boy "Booger Boy" and
he didn't do anything about it?

228
00:13:40,499 --> 00:13:43,007
-What is his real name anyway?
-Nobody remembers.

229
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:44,862
I'm in.

230
00:14:10,134 --> 00:14:12,334
-Dad's under there!
-Oh, my God you're right!

231
00:14:12,635 --> 00:14:13,964
-Let's go!
-No, no, no.

232
00:14:22,121 --> 00:14:25,854
-You boys are in so much trouble.
-I'm calling Mom.

233
00:14:26,746 --> 00:14:27,704
Dad, are you okay?

234
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:30,566
I can't feel anything
below my left knee.

235
00:14:30,843 --> 00:14:32,163
Is my foot okay?

236
00:14:32,735 --> 00:14:34,077
Your foot looks fine.

237
00:14:35,314 --> 00:14:37,914
But I think the rest of you
is facing the wrong way.

238
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:43,224
I can't find him anywhere.
Have you seen Craig?

239
00:14:43,227 --> 00:14:43,774
No.

240
00:14:44,303 --> 00:14:47,400
So now on Lois, I'm off to the head
office. A place we're washing your hands

241
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:50,980
after using the restroom is a matter of personal choice.
-Good-bye, Joe.

242
00:14:51,311 --> 00:14:55,027
-By the way, what did Cochran
give you to cover for me?
-What?

243
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:58,600
You know, for throwing Craig under
the truck. Taking the heat off me.

244
00:14:58,972 --> 00:15:04,718
-You really are Cochran's snitch?
-No, I'm getting kickedtairs
because of my skills and motivation.

245
00:15:04,766 --> 00:15:08,059
But that's impossible. I saw Craig
handing Cochran a list of names.

246
00:15:08,089 --> 00:15:08,715
What?

247
00:15:08,897 --> 00:15:12,625
Oh, those were probably names
for that stupid surprise party
he's throwing for you.

248
00:15:12,655 --> 00:15:14,132
What are you talking about?

249
00:15:14,133 --> 00:15:16,722
Craig wanted make a big deal of your
tenth anniversary of working here.

250
00:15:16,752 --> 00:15:19,252
I told him would just depress
you, but know Craig.

251
00:15:20,702 --> 00:15:22,568
Cleanup in the storeroom.

252
00:15:23,754 --> 00:15:24,946
Oh, my God.

253
00:15:27,226 --> 00:15:28,242
Craig!

254
00:15:32,016 --> 00:15:33,442
I'm so sorry.

255
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:36,384
Why didn't you tell me
you were playing a party?

256
00:15:36,407 --> 00:15:37,335
You know ?

257
00:15:37,404 --> 00:15:41,773
-Oh Lord, this day just
keep getting worse.
-Oh, Craig, this is all my fault.

258
00:15:41,851 --> 00:15:46,451
I just feel awful about this.
I'll do whatever it take to make
this up to you. I'll even...

259
00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:47,690
Oh, hold on a second.

260
00:15:49,473 --> 00:15:49,922
Allo?

261
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,850
Mom, it's an emergency. You've go to
home quick. Something horrible happened.

262
00:15:54,705 --> 00:15:56,655
Allo? Dewey? Dewey!

263
00:15:56,830 --> 00:16:01,041
Lois, if you could just get the ropes.
My hands are wet,
I think wrists are bleeding.

264
00:16:01,071 --> 00:16:02,087
I'll be right back.

265
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:05,330
Party starts at 5:00.

266
00:16:08,935 --> 00:16:10,772
See? Better than you.

267
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:14,950
-That's not going to work, Dad.
-We really have to get to the hospital.

268
00:16:14,951 --> 00:16:17,003
I can't go to the hospital!

269
00:16:17,461 --> 00:16:21,331
Nobody in this family can go to the
hospital. We've got no insurance.

270
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:24,267
Why do you think I've been so
concerned about your safety?

271
00:16:24,297 --> 00:16:26,056
Dad, it's not the
end of the world.

272
00:16:26,095 --> 00:16:29,772
Of course it is.
Your mother will never forgive me.

273
00:16:31,093 --> 00:16:34,220
This is worse than the time
I left Dewey in Mexico.

274
00:16:34,317 --> 00:16:36,326
This is unforgivable.

275
00:16:38,158 --> 00:16:39,878
I'm unforgivable.

276
00:16:44,121 --> 00:16:48,293
Whoa. I didn't think Dad would
get this pathetic 'till we locked
him in a nursing home.

277
00:16:48,323 --> 00:16:51,200
This family deserves
better than me.

278
00:16:54,914 --> 00:16:56,556
Your mother's home, boys.

279
00:16:57,070 --> 00:16:57,969
Help me up.

280
00:17:01,046 --> 00:17:02,102
I raced home!

281
00:17:02,282 --> 00:17:03,054
What is it?

282
00:17:03,104 --> 00:17:06,954
-Honey there's something you should know.
-Nine minutes and 23 seconds. I win.

283
00:17:09,092 --> 00:17:10,145
What are you talking about?

284
00:17:10,175 --> 00:17:13,454
We made a bet to see how quickly
you could get here if you thought
there was an emergency.

285
00:17:13,484 --> 00:17:15,613
You don't win.
Reese said ten minutes.

286
00:17:15,652 --> 00:17:17,068
But you're not allowed to go over.

287
00:17:17,098 --> 00:17:18,886
You can't decide that now.
That's cheating!

288
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:20,010
You did what?!

289
00:17:20,085 --> 00:17:21,735
I don't blame you
for being mad, Mom.

290
00:17:21,911 --> 00:17:23,602
Reese underestimates
you all the time.

291
00:17:23,632 --> 00:17:25,385
This is just a game?!

292
00:17:25,685 --> 00:17:29,735
You made me race across town
thinking one of you was dying
and it's just a game?!

293
00:17:29,739 --> 00:17:31,722
We got bored.
There's not much to do around here.

294
00:17:31,752 --> 00:17:34,836
Yeah, maybe if you took us
on a trip once in a while...

295
00:17:34,856 --> 00:17:36,346
Hal, do you hear this?

296
00:17:37,619 --> 00:17:38,588
I'm on it, Lois.

297
00:17:38,595 --> 00:17:39,932
I can't believe that...

298
00:17:40,718 --> 00:17:41,949
Hal, are you crying?

299
00:17:42,425 --> 00:17:43,813
With rage!

300
00:17:44,017 --> 00:17:47,067
You know how mad I get when
these boys pull stunts like this.

301
00:17:47,601 --> 00:17:49,536
There's something
fishy about this.

302
00:17:49,595 --> 00:17:51,937
Fishy is a nice way
to put it, Lois.

303
00:17:51,997 --> 00:17:54,381
They are gonna get the
grounding of their life.

304
00:17:54,493 --> 00:17:57,346
They are gonna feel the
full brunt of my wrath.

305
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:06,701
Oh, I've been wrong about so much
lately I don't even trust my own radar.

306
00:18:06,731 --> 00:18:07,893
I got to get back to work.

307
00:18:07,923 --> 00:18:10,694
You start the punishment,
Hal, but leave some for me.

308
00:18:12,902 --> 00:18:13,957
Drive safely.

309
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:21,999
It's gonna be okay, Dad.

310
00:18:22,259 --> 00:18:27,360
It's a very special moment
when a father watches his
boys lie to their mother for him.

311
00:18:27,593 --> 00:18:30,543
There's only one thing that
could make this moment prouder.

312
00:18:31,082 --> 00:18:33,994
If one of you could saw off my leg.

313
00:18:34,617 --> 00:18:35,467
Don't worry, Dad.

314
00:18:35,492 --> 00:18:36,733
We'll get your knee taken care of.

315
00:18:36,763 --> 00:18:40,356
I told you. We have no medical
insurance. There's no way.

316
00:18:40,376 --> 00:18:40,688
Dad.

317
00:18:41,763 --> 00:18:43,119
This is what we do.

318
00:18:48,046 --> 00:18:49,727
Happy anniversary, Lois.

319
00:18:50,331 --> 00:18:53,556
I chewed through my ropes so
I could have this set up for you
when you got back.

320
00:18:53,586 --> 00:18:54,876
Oh, Craig.

321
00:18:55,035 --> 00:18:57,896
I invited the entire staff,
but I guess they didn't show up,

322
00:18:57,926 --> 00:18:59,593
on account of seeing
me as human garbage.

323
00:18:59,623 --> 00:19:01,362
I wish you'd be mad at me.

324
00:19:01,393 --> 00:19:04,174
Yell at me, tell me I'm a
horrible person. Please.

325
00:19:04,277 --> 00:19:06,047
Don't apologize, Lois.

326
00:19:06,349 --> 00:19:10,649
If you want to make me happy,
just sit down and enjoy your party.

327
00:19:17,148 --> 00:19:18,360
Hello, everybody.

328
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,680
Here's one I'm sure
you'll all remember.

329
00:19:22,088 --> 00:19:25,489
Here she comes now,
our Lois, Lois.

330
00:19:28,783 --> 00:19:32,380
Struttin' down the aisle
like she doesn't know us.

331
00:19:35,589 --> 00:19:39,186
Hey, she wears a smock and
she looks all right, yeah.

332
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:45,828
You gotta scan and stock
and mark the cat chow...

333
00:19:45,887 --> 00:19:47,617
Meow, meow, meow, meow.

334
00:19:47,696 --> 00:19:48,371
Yeah.

335
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:49,890
<i>Yeah.</i>

336
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:50,713
Yeah.

337
00:19:50,901 --> 00:19:51,477
Yeah.

338
00:19:51,562 --> 00:19:52,692
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

339
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:53,258
Yeah.

340
00:19:53,336 --> 00:19:55,017
'Cause she's been here ten...

341
00:19:55,762 --> 00:19:56,805
...Years.

342
00:19:57,393 --> 00:20:00,132
Through the laughs,
through the tears.

343
00:20:00,456 --> 00:20:03,309
Punchin' in. Punchin' out.

344
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:06,882
'Cept that time she had gout.

345
00:20:07,221 --> 00:20:08,489
I say yeah.

346
00:20:08,669 --> 00:20:09,314
Yeah.

347
00:20:09,478 --> 00:20:10,215
Yeah.

348
00:20:10,352 --> 00:20:10,897
Yeah.

349
00:20:11,144 --> 00:20:11,733
Yeah.

350
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:12,417
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

351
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:12,991
Yeah.

352
00:20:13,157 --> 00:20:14,022
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

353
00:20:17,325 --> 00:20:19,260
Yeah, the knee's dislocated.

354
00:20:19,364 --> 00:20:22,073
So what are you?
Some kind of prodigy genius doctor?

355
00:20:22,229 --> 00:20:24,417
No, my dad's a
really bad doctor.

356
00:20:24,471 --> 00:20:25,721
He lets me use his stuff.

357
00:20:27,174 --> 00:20:29,958
-You know, boys. I'm not
sure we need Richard.
-He does great work, Dad.

358
00:20:29,988 --> 00:20:31,806
He set my nose three times.

359
00:20:31,863 --> 00:20:34,072
He gave me a tracheotomy
with a crazy straw.

360
00:20:36,297 --> 00:20:38,447
What kind of anesthetic do you use?

361
00:20:39,228 --> 00:20:44,212
Well, in a case like this, you're gonna
need about eight c.c.'s of... Grab him!

362
00:20:45,463 --> 00:20:47,574
<i>No!</i>

363
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:48,950
Hey, look at that.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
