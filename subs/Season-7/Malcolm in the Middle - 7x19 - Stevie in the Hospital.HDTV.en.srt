1
00:00:02,824 --> 00:00:04,475
Jamie, time to get going.
Let's put your shoes on.

2
00:00:11,532 --> 00:00:12,593
Wonder what's gotten into him.

3
00:00:12,784 --> 00:00:13,559
I have no idea.

4
00:00:14,254 --> 00:00:16,497
Now pay attention. I'm only going
to show this to you one more time.

5
00:00:18,201 --> 00:00:19,786
The rabbit comes out of his hole,

6
00:00:20,289 --> 00:00:21,400
<i>and runs around the tree.</i>

7
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:23,558
But he won't stop
laughing at you.

8
00:00:23,929 --> 00:00:25,408
So you grab him
by the tail

9
00:00:25,549 --> 00:00:26,971
and it rips off in your hand.

10
00:00:27,384 --> 00:00:29,495
You follow the trail of
blood back to his hole.

11
00:00:29,668 --> 00:00:32,983
And then you reach in, pull the
rabbit out and then you strangle him!

12
00:00:34,619 --> 00:00:35,793
And then you're
ready to walk around.

13
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:44,830
Malcolm in the Middle

16
00:01:13,202 --> 00:01:14,263
What do you say, Reese?

17
00:01:14,366 --> 00:01:16,263
You want to take the new
boat out this afternoon?

18
00:01:16,428 --> 00:01:17,926
Maiden voyage.
Just you and me.

19
00:01:18,158 --> 00:01:21,897
Father and son slicing through
the waves, wind in our hair.

20
00:01:22,054 --> 00:01:22,534
And look.

21
00:01:24,772 --> 00:01:26,878
<i>I re-did the aft bathroom.</i>

22
00:01:26,977 --> 00:01:28,335
Sorry, Dad, I start
my new job today.

23
00:01:28,853 --> 00:01:29,739
Oh, come on!

24
00:01:29,744 --> 00:01:31,807
You don't actually do
any work the first day.

25
00:01:32,167 --> 00:01:34,779
You're just filling out forms
and deciding on a nemesis.

26
00:01:34,789 --> 00:01:36,566
Did you know how hard
it was to get this job?

27
00:01:36,757 --> 00:01:38,607
Everywhere else I applied
called my references.

28
00:01:39,042 --> 00:01:40,721
Thank God telemarketing
has no standards.

29
00:01:41,081 --> 00:01:43,281
Basically, I get to harass old
people and shut-ins all day.

30
00:01:43,573 --> 00:01:45,043
I'm getting paid to do what I love.

31
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,162
-Picture this, Dewey...
-Not gonna happen.

32
00:01:48,973 --> 00:01:50,065
Give me one good reason.

33
00:01:50,176 --> 00:01:52,659
You're forcing me to say exactly
why I don't want to do this

34
00:01:52,662 --> 00:01:55,167
and it's not going to make you happy
and it's not going to make me happy.

35
00:01:55,978 --> 00:01:57,127
So why don't we just leave it alone?

36
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:00,903
How 'bout it, Malcolm?

37
00:02:01,267 --> 00:02:02,500
You're gonna be out
of the house soon.

38
00:02:02,742 --> 00:02:06,139
This could be our last chance to
spend some quality together time.

39
00:02:06,253 --> 00:02:07,021
I can't, Dad.

40
00:02:07,299 --> 00:02:09,005
You know it was Stevie's
big surgery yesterday.

41
00:02:09,197 --> 00:02:11,547
They just moved him out of intensive
care and I really want to go visit him.

42
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:12,246
Damn!

43
00:02:12,659 --> 00:02:13,441
See you tonight.

44
00:02:14,397 --> 00:02:17,010
Mom, did you remember to buy
the baking soda for my class project?

45
00:02:17,122 --> 00:02:18,330
Ah, I forgot.

46
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:20,456
What? I asked you like five times.

47
00:02:20,683 --> 00:02:21,541
That I remember.

48
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:23,490
My science partner's
going to hate me.

49
00:02:23,717 --> 00:02:25,897
I was supposed to bring in
the baking soda for a volcano.

50
00:02:25,907 --> 00:02:27,537
Now it's just going to be
a mountain full of vinegar.

51
00:02:28,057 --> 00:02:29,166
Just do what your brother did.

52
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,942
Take the baby powder and blame
the guy who brought the vinegar.

53
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:36,588
I'm glad you changed your
mind and decided to join me.

54
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:41,966
It's nice to know that at least one
of my sons isn't too busy to spend
a little time with the old man.

55
00:02:42,785 --> 00:02:43,483
Oh, here, look.

56
00:02:45,427 --> 00:02:46,838
The deck is real teak.

57
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,279
There's even a working foghorn. Listen.

58
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:54,224
Easy, it's not a toy.

59
00:02:59,015 --> 00:03:00,178
You're sitting on my bench.

60
00:03:00,644 --> 00:03:00,928
What?

61
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:02,231
That's my bench.

62
00:03:02,618 --> 00:03:05,526
I don't think anybody owns
the benches, young man.

63
00:03:05,529 --> 00:03:07,107
I'm sure you can...
find another one.

64
00:03:07,624 --> 00:03:08,912
I don't want to find another one.

65
00:03:10,674 --> 00:03:12,256
I always sit here.

66
00:03:16,284 --> 00:03:17,654
Jamie, I'll handle this.

67
00:03:17,804 --> 00:03:21,119
Kid, I didn't see you wiping off the
pigeon poop with your son's blankie.

68
00:03:21,141 --> 00:03:23,108
I've earned this
bench so take a hike.

69
00:03:31,367 --> 00:03:34,488
Okay, let's set her out there
and aim for the horizon.

70
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:37,938
She's in God's hands now.

71
00:03:38,587 --> 00:03:39,983
Well... in mine.

72
00:03:42,781 --> 00:03:43,465
Steady.

73
00:03:45,819 --> 00:03:47,324
Steady as she goes.

74
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:50,116
<i>Look at her.</i>

75
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:52,084
She is yar.

76
00:04:05,264 --> 00:04:06,126
Are you crazy?!

77
00:04:06,725 --> 00:04:07,673
What do you think you're doing?!

78
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,186
I'm think I'm sinking your boat!

79
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:21,926
Ma'am, anyone who enjoys breathing
will benefit from the new Ionator 5150.

80
00:04:21,941 --> 00:04:25,788
This amazing all natural purifier
has been proven to remove 63%...

81
00:04:25,795 --> 00:04:28,087
...of all airborne pathogens
including asbestos,

82
00:04:28,092 --> 00:04:30,031
cigarette smoke and
Taiwanese dust mites.

83
00:04:30,485 --> 00:04:32,020
If you order now, we guarantee...

84
00:04:32,029 --> 00:04:33,399
...you'll probably be dead by morning.

85
00:04:33,846 --> 00:04:36,100
But you're right, buddy,
your life's not worth 50 bucks,

86
00:04:36,372 --> 00:04:39,633
so please let me off the phone so I can
start saving people who want to live.

87
00:04:41,118 --> 00:04:44,436
All right, fine, I'll put you down for two,
but next time, don't jerk me around.

88
00:04:45,988 --> 00:04:47,874
How's everything going over here?

89
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,878
People are so stupid
they'll believe anything.

90
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:52,464
I threw the fact sheet out the window
and just started making stuff up.

91
00:04:54,726 --> 00:04:56,702
Ah, no problem.
I made up the fact sheet.

92
00:04:57,056 --> 00:04:59,190
Six sales in 20 minutes.
You're a natural.

93
00:04:59,492 --> 00:05:02,286
Keep this up and you got a good
shot at winning the sales contest.

94
00:05:02,356 --> 00:05:03,064
What contest?

95
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:06,055
We're tallying total sales
over on the big board.

96
00:05:06,628 --> 00:05:08,565
First prize is a flat-screen TV.

97
00:05:09,173 --> 00:05:10,882
Second prize is a barbecue grill.

98
00:05:10,883 --> 00:05:13,221
Third prize is one of our air purifiers.

99
00:05:13,886 --> 00:05:16,356
But believe me, you don't want that.

100
00:05:17,443 --> 00:05:18,367
Keep up the good work.

101
00:05:24,274 --> 00:05:26,666
Hello, I'm calling from
Air Scrub Air Filters.

102
00:05:27,925 --> 00:05:29,603
No, no, no, don't
put Mommy on the phone.

103
00:05:30,105 --> 00:05:31,148
Just get her credit card.

104
00:05:35,154 --> 00:05:35,918
How was Stevie?

105
00:05:36,045 --> 00:05:36,965
I didn't get to see him.

106
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:39,193
You left for the hospital
over three hours ago.

107
00:05:39,197 --> 00:05:40,650
I tried taking the express bus,

108
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:42,768
but somehow I ended up
on a shuttle to the airport.

109
00:05:42,985 --> 00:05:44,696
Seriously, they need to
label those things better.

110
00:05:45,052 --> 00:05:47,539
They're bright red and say
"airport shuttle" on the side.

111
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:50,636
We drove right past the hospital, but
the stupid driver wouldn't let me out.

112
00:05:50,687 --> 00:05:51,806
When did people stop caring?

113
00:05:51,843 --> 00:05:54,231
Calm down, Malcolm. It's no
big deal. You can go tomorrow.

114
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:55,675
Yeah, if the buses will let me.

115
00:05:59,142 --> 00:06:00,251
Hey, sweetie, how was your day?

116
00:06:34,266 --> 00:06:35,530
<i>I love this new job.</i>

117
00:06:35,748 --> 00:06:39,450
If you claim to be a doctor on the phone,
no one questions it, not even other doctors.

118
00:06:39,927 --> 00:06:42,274
All right, would someone care
to explain something to me?

119
00:06:42,464 --> 00:06:42,748
What?

120
00:06:43,185 --> 00:06:45,672
Why is this sleeve slightly
shorter than this sleeve?

121
00:06:46,175 --> 00:06:47,479
Maybe one of your
arms is getting longer.

122
00:06:47,491 --> 00:06:48,593
They're not. I measured them.

123
00:06:49,032 --> 00:06:49,642
That's crazy.

124
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:50,780
Oh, you'd like me to think so,

125
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:52,908
but I know someone has
been messing with my stuff.

126
00:06:53,141 --> 00:06:55,559
The mirrors on my car are
askew, my toothbrush is wet,

127
00:06:55,946 --> 00:06:59,759
and the lint trap in the dryer,
which I emptied this morning,
is now magically full of lint.

128
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:01,629
Should you even be doing
laundry in this condition?

129
00:07:01,637 --> 00:07:04,605
I want to know who's responsible
and I want to know now.

130
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,669
Mom, why would we
do any of that to you?

131
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:07,847
Yeah, Mom, why would we?

132
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:19,022
Excuse me, what room
is Stevie Kenarban in?

133
00:07:19,031 --> 00:07:19,541
Let me check.

134
00:07:20,347 --> 00:07:22,560
He's in room 220
right up the elevator.

135
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:23,004
Thank you.

136
00:07:28,235 --> 00:07:29,732
I was going to come
visit yesterday morning,

137
00:07:29,737 --> 00:07:32,926
but I had this giant hole in my lunch
bag and everything just spilled out.

138
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:33,997
My tuna sandwich was fine,

139
00:07:34,038 --> 00:07:36,283
but my orange started rolling down this
hill, and by the time I caught up with it,

140
00:07:36,465 --> 00:07:37,356
I was late for school.

141
00:07:41,312 --> 00:07:42,939
It's still room 220.

142
00:07:50,104 --> 00:07:52,014
Where would it be
possible to find a gift?

143
00:07:53,538 --> 00:07:55,569
I would try the gift shop.

144
00:07:55,882 --> 00:07:57,137
Good idea. Thanks.

145
00:07:57,141 --> 00:07:57,872
You're welcome.

146
00:08:16,584 --> 00:08:18,089
Can I help you find something?

147
00:08:18,974 --> 00:08:21,081
Yeah, do you have any cards
that don't say "Get well"?

148
00:08:21,365 --> 00:08:25,529
This is a hospital. Usually,
we're rooting for the patient.

149
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:28,329
I get it, it's just that all these
cards are really generic.

150
00:08:28,751 --> 00:08:30,758
And this is for my best friend,
so I need something special.

151
00:08:31,205 --> 00:08:32,480
How about flowers?

152
00:08:32,998 --> 00:08:34,307
I'm not asking him to marry me.

153
00:08:37,003 --> 00:08:38,416
This bear's pretty popular.

154
00:08:38,447 --> 00:08:38,988
Let's see.

155
00:08:39,373 --> 00:08:42,635
He's allergic to the fur,
the stuffing plastic eyes.

156
00:08:43,418 --> 00:08:44,529
And what's this tag made out of?

157
00:08:48,104 --> 00:08:48,540
Okay...

158
00:08:49,098 --> 00:08:50,089
Let's go with the hula guy.

159
00:08:50,274 --> 00:08:51,034
You're sure?

160
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:51,580
Definitely.

161
00:08:52,315 --> 00:08:54,307
<i>So we've narrowed it
down to ten possibilities.</i>

162
00:08:54,393 --> 00:08:56,367
Let's go over the pros
and cons one more time.

163
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:59,819
<i>Attention: It is now 9:00.
Visiting hours are over.</i>

164
00:09:00,283 --> 00:09:00,630
What?

165
00:09:01,652 --> 00:09:02,926
I can't believe you
let this happen!

166
00:09:18,376 --> 00:09:19,981
Reese is sales machine.

167
00:09:20,889 --> 00:09:22,874
If he keeps up this pace, he's
going to win the whole thing.

168
00:09:22,881 --> 00:09:23,473
Don't worry.

169
00:09:23,968 --> 00:09:26,242
I gave him the list of people
that told us to go to hell.

170
00:09:27,292 --> 00:09:30,206
Listen, we wouldn't be calling
again if it wasn't an emergency.

171
00:09:31,224 --> 00:09:34,747
The utility company's informed
us that there's an alarming
amount of graydon in your home.

172
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,006
Now, your family's been
chosen to survive,

173
00:09:37,466 --> 00:09:39,135
but your neighbors aren't
going to be so lucky.

174
00:09:40,122 --> 00:09:41,757
Look, don't buy it from Air Scrub.

175
00:09:42,038 --> 00:09:45,964
Buy it from one of our competitors.
I gave you the number, but
for the love of God hurry!

176
00:09:51,826 --> 00:09:53,427
Happy Air, how may I help you?

177
00:09:55,474 --> 00:09:58,422
And there isn't any kind of
construction or quarantines,

178
00:09:58,672 --> 00:10:00,900
and you're not planning on moving
the hospital before I can get there?

179
00:10:03,063 --> 00:10:05,416
Fine. Go take care of
your precious bus crash.

180
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:09,240
I want to make sure
I cover all my bases.

181
00:10:09,517 --> 00:10:10,410
I got the directions,

182
00:10:10,599 --> 00:10:12,339
I got a gift, his favorite cookies.

183
00:10:12,785 --> 00:10:15,610
This time there's nothing that
can stop me from visiting Stevie.

184
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:21,609
There are very few things in this
world as valuable as friendship.

185
00:10:22,004 --> 00:10:22,506
<i>Damn.</i>

186
00:10:25,718 --> 00:10:26,458
What's wrong, Dad?

187
00:10:26,528 --> 00:10:28,455
Nothing, I just put the
battery in backwards.

188
00:10:29,636 --> 00:10:31,965
Oh, God. Why now?

189
00:10:31,973 --> 00:10:33,298
I can't leave him like this.

190
00:10:35,556 --> 00:10:36,524
I'm here for you, Dad.

191
00:10:36,574 --> 00:10:38,185
I think I can handle it, Malcolm.

192
00:10:38,586 --> 00:10:40,522
I just need to get a little
water out of the hull.

193
00:10:40,585 --> 00:10:41,295
How'd that happen?

194
00:10:41,452 --> 00:10:42,253
It's nothing.

195
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:44,775
Some punk kid swamped me.

196
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,886
And you're just gonna let
him get away with that?

197
00:10:47,436 --> 00:10:49,995
It's no big deal. I'll just go
to another part of the lake.

198
00:10:50,015 --> 00:10:51,475
Why? So he can sink you there, too?

199
00:10:51,737 --> 00:10:52,676
You've to fight back.

200
00:10:52,922 --> 00:10:54,813
What did you always teach me
about standing up for myself?

201
00:10:54,918 --> 00:10:56,647
I can't beat up a ten-year-old.

202
00:10:57,833 --> 00:10:59,864
I suppose I could hold him
down while you hit him.

203
00:10:59,869 --> 00:11:02,028
No, Dad. Let's beat him on the water.

204
00:11:02,111 --> 00:11:04,651
With just a few modifications,
we can make this boat unstoppable.

205
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:08,359
We can reinforce the rudder
for better steering and put
a titanium tip on the prow.

206
00:11:08,596 --> 00:11:10,054
We'll slice his boat in half!

207
00:11:10,221 --> 00:11:11,283
We can really do all that?

208
00:11:11,308 --> 00:11:11,909
Absolutely.

209
00:11:12,632 --> 00:11:14,315
Could we put a little
skipper on the deck?

210
00:11:14,351 --> 00:11:15,208
I don't see why not.

211
00:11:15,523 --> 00:11:19,043
Malcolm, it's times like these I'm
certain you weren't switched at birth.

212
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:19,649
Thanks, Dad.

213
00:11:19,969 --> 00:11:21,071
Now come on. We got
a lot of work to do.

214
00:11:22,164 --> 00:11:22,583
Cookie?

215
00:11:23,199 --> 00:11:24,100
Oh, thank you.

216
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:32,756
Gotcha!

217
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:34,773
Sorry, Hal, I thought you
were someone else.

218
00:11:34,782 --> 00:11:35,714
What are you doing?

219
00:11:36,334 --> 00:11:37,443
How long have you been in there?

220
00:11:37,448 --> 00:11:38,272
Just a few hours.

221
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:39,439
A few hours?!

222
00:11:40,206 --> 00:11:41,042
What's going on?

223
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,127
I don't know, Hal.

224
00:11:42,907 --> 00:11:44,962
I think one of the boys
is screwing with me.

225
00:11:46,148 --> 00:11:48,229
My bookmark was on the wrong page.

226
00:11:48,456 --> 00:11:50,013
I found a loose thread on my smock.

227
00:11:50,323 --> 00:11:54,513
The car radio was tuned to a station
next to the one that I always listen to.

228
00:11:55,152 --> 00:11:57,118
Oh, my God, I sound insane, don't I?

229
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,279
Honey, what you need is to take
a step back and clear your head.

230
00:12:00,505 --> 00:12:01,406
You know what helps me?

231
00:12:01,611 --> 00:12:03,787
Working with Malcolm
to weaponize my boat.

232
00:12:20,321 --> 00:12:22,212
I understand you're very upset,

233
00:12:22,463 --> 00:12:24,402
but if you'd just let me get a word in.

234
00:12:26,007 --> 00:12:29,460
I know I'm the new guy, but you've
been on the phone for a half hour
and you haven't close this deal?

235
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:31,771
Remember your ABCs.

236
00:12:31,854 --> 00:12:33,390
Always Be Selling.

237
00:12:33,457 --> 00:12:35,218
I can't interrupt him when
he's in the middle of...

238
00:12:35,223 --> 00:12:37,149
Hey, this isn't tele-listening.

239
00:12:37,353 --> 00:12:37,977
Give me the phone.

240
00:12:38,278 --> 00:12:39,423
I'll show you how to churn butter.

241
00:12:41,589 --> 00:12:44,575
All right, gabby, we have better
things to do than talk to you all day.

242
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:47,227
Now, give me one reason why
you don't need an air purifier.

243
00:12:48,422 --> 00:12:49,734
<i>I'm going to kill myself.</i>

244
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:51,085
Nice try.

245
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:52,941
I use that excuse all the time.

246
00:12:52,949 --> 00:12:54,053
<i>No, I'm serious.</i>

247
00:12:54,349 --> 00:12:56,460
<i>I just feel like I can't go on.</i>

248
00:12:56,718 --> 00:12:58,298
<i>I'm clinically depressed.</i>

249
00:12:58,498 --> 00:13:01,105
<i>And my cat dies because
he was allergic to me!</i>

250
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:03,389
<i>Oh, and my wife rans off
with my brother Ted,</i>

251
00:13:03,394 --> 00:13:06,453
<i>and then my family just touched
the inside that I'm not allowed to...</i>

252
00:13:06,563 --> 00:13:07,462
Get the manual!

253
00:13:25,785 --> 00:13:28,386
All right, Dewey, I know what's
going on. I know it's you.

254
00:13:29,364 --> 00:13:31,382
If it were Reese, he'd be
bragging to everyone about it.

255
00:13:31,528 --> 00:13:32,761
Malcolm doesn't have the patience.

256
00:13:32,856 --> 00:13:34,063
So, that leaves you, Dewey.

257
00:13:34,754 --> 00:13:39,171
If I had any proof, we'd be having this
conversation while I was walling you
up inside your bedroom closet.

258
00:13:43,508 --> 00:13:45,249
This is about the volcano, isn't it?

259
00:13:46,274 --> 00:13:51,031
All right, I acknowledge that perhaps
I was a little inconsiderate of your needs,

260
00:13:51,718 --> 00:13:54,933
but that in no way justifies
these petty attacks.

261
00:13:56,087 --> 00:13:57,785
Still, we have to move on.

262
00:14:01,063 --> 00:14:02,144
So, here's the deal:

263
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:07,872
In the future, I promise to be more
attentive and aware of your feelings,

264
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:11,730
not that being the loving mother I am,
I wouldn't be doing that anyway.

265
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:16,776
And in return,

266
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:19,985
you will promise to stop this
stupid campaign to drive me crazy.

267
00:14:20,971 --> 00:14:23,597
Just give me a little sign that
we understand each other.

268
00:14:27,869 --> 00:14:28,337
Good.

269
00:14:37,443 --> 00:14:38,692
Now, just be cool, Malcolm.

270
00:14:39,173 --> 00:14:42,974
As far as anyone knows, we're just a normal
father and son who love each other.

271
00:14:43,162 --> 00:14:44,075
<i>Stay calm.</i>

272
00:14:44,081 --> 00:14:45,568
There's a woman with a stroller.

273
00:14:46,355 --> 00:14:48,558
Wave with me so it looks natural.

274
00:14:49,893 --> 00:14:51,397
Good, she's buying it.
Arms down.

275
00:14:52,705 --> 00:14:54,288
No one suspects a thing.

276
00:14:56,899 --> 00:14:58,203
<i>Steer clear of those ducks.</i>

277
00:14:58,756 --> 00:14:59,878
We'll deal with them later.

278
00:15:04,552 --> 00:15:05,824
I hope this kid shows up soon.

279
00:15:06,045 --> 00:15:07,534
I was planning on
visiting Stevie today.

280
00:15:07,702 --> 00:15:09,100
You just saw him yesterday, didn't you?

281
00:15:09,977 --> 00:15:10,665
Not exactly.

282
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:13,385
But you did see him
over the weekend, right?

283
00:15:13,722 --> 00:15:14,062
No.

284
00:15:15,544 --> 00:15:15,830
Wait.

285
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:17,826
How many times have
you seen Stevie?

286
00:15:18,579 --> 00:15:19,624
If you add them all up...

287
00:15:21,691 --> 00:15:22,234
none.

288
00:15:23,087 --> 00:15:23,726
None?

289
00:15:24,684 --> 00:15:26,783
Malcolm, I can't believe
what I'm hearing.

290
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:30,653
Your best friend is in the hospital, and
you're here helping me stalk a ten-year-old.

291
00:15:30,709 --> 00:15:34,185
I'm trying, but visiting someone in the
hospital isn't as easy as you might think.

292
00:15:34,889 --> 00:15:37,049
Malcolm, don't you see
what you're doing?

293
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:39,999
You're just avoiding
an unpleasant situation.

294
00:15:40,236 --> 00:15:40,828
I know.

295
00:15:42,002 --> 00:15:45,340
It's just that Stevie and I have never
really talked seriously about his illnesses.

296
00:15:45,635 --> 00:15:48,860
We've kind of had this
unspoken agreement that
he was just a regular kid.

297
00:15:49,246 --> 00:15:51,309
If I had to see him lying
in his hospital bed,

298
00:15:51,595 --> 00:15:55,983
hooked up to God knows what, it's kind
of hard to pretend like nothing's wrong.

299
00:15:57,257 --> 00:15:58,264
I just don't know what to say.

300
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:01,147
Son, don't think about it.

301
00:16:02,806 --> 00:16:05,415
Sometimes all you
have to say is hello.

302
00:16:08,385 --> 00:16:09,427
That's a great way to put it.

303
00:16:10,482 --> 00:16:11,195
So simple.

304
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:13,045
I got it off that
bus bench over there.

305
00:16:13,736 --> 00:16:15,226
It's an ad for a
long-distance company.

306
00:16:17,175 --> 00:16:20,637
You get yourself down to that hospital
and show Stevie that you give a damn.

307
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:21,951
-Thanks, Dad.
-All right.

308
00:16:38,108 --> 00:16:40,092
It's high noon somewhere.

309
00:17:05,436 --> 00:17:06,534
Not this time.

310
00:18:01,832 --> 00:18:05,186
Oh, no! What am I
ever going to do?

311
00:18:06,332 --> 00:18:07,326
What about this?

312
00:18:12,584 --> 00:18:14,817
Say hello to my little friend!

313
00:18:23,418 --> 00:18:25,708
Hey, you broke my boat!

314
00:18:25,711 --> 00:18:27,562
It's that kind of
party, little man.

315
00:18:30,185 --> 00:18:32,003
<i>That was my grandad's boat.</i>

316
00:18:32,677 --> 00:18:34,707
<i>He gave it to me
before he died.</i>

317
00:18:38,891 --> 00:18:39,913
He started it.

318
00:18:42,592 --> 00:18:45,876
<i>There just doesn't seem like
there's any reason to go on living.</i>

319
00:18:46,601 --> 00:18:49,958
<i>I'm overweight, I don't
have any friends. I just...</i>

320
00:18:51,523 --> 00:18:52,936
<i>Look, look, this is pointless.</i>

321
00:18:52,941 --> 00:18:55,998
<i>I'm just gonna hang up now.
No one cares about me.</i>

322
00:18:56,433 --> 00:18:57,208
Listen, Lyle.

323
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,902
I'm as lost as you are.

324
00:19:01,284 --> 00:19:04,515
I mean... I may not even
graduate high school.

325
00:19:04,855 --> 00:19:06,303
I'm completely broke.

326
00:19:07,341 --> 00:19:09,661
If I disappeared,
who would notice?

327
00:19:11,289 --> 00:19:12,593
But now I've got a purpose.

328
00:19:14,011 --> 00:19:15,882
Maybe you and I were
meant to talk today.

329
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,903
You mean like... like fate?

330
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:19,942
Exactly.

331
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,866
Maybe life is like
a roller coaster,

332
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:25,531
and you only go down so
you can fun coming back up.

333
00:19:27,547 --> 00:19:28,239
<i>Maybe.</i>

334
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:32,459
<i>Well, I... I actually
feel a little better.</i>

335
00:19:34,655 --> 00:19:35,801
Now, this is what I want you to do.

336
00:19:36,899 --> 00:19:38,479
I want you to walk to the bathroom,

337
00:19:39,249 --> 00:19:41,398
and I want to hear you flush
those pills down the toilet.

338
00:19:44,378 --> 00:19:45,133
<i>They're gone.</i>

339
00:19:45,542 --> 00:19:46,451
<i>I-I did it.</i>

340
00:19:48,869 --> 00:19:50,715
<i>I don't know what to say.
Thank you, Reese.</i>

341
00:19:51,049 --> 00:19:51,738
<i>Thank you.</i>

342
00:19:51,894 --> 00:19:52,970
Don't thank me, Lyle.

343
00:19:53,247 --> 00:19:54,323
This is all you.

344
00:19:54,858 --> 00:19:56,863
You should feel good about
yourself for what you did today.

345
00:19:57,113 --> 00:19:59,089
You should treat yourself
to something really nice.

346
00:20:00,102 --> 00:20:03,587
Why don't you take out your credit
card and buy a dozen air purifiers.

347
00:20:05,933 --> 00:20:08,294
Well, that... That sounds
a little expensive.

348
00:20:08,628 --> 00:20:10,777
I just saved your life and
now you're questioning me?!

349
00:20:10,782 --> 00:20:12,280
<i>Look, I'm, I'm sorry.
I was just saying...</i>

350
00:20:12,282 --> 00:20:14,370
Every minute I'm talking to
you, the price is going up!

351
00:20:14,522 --> 00:20:16,298
I want those numbers
now, do you hear me?

352
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,857
Let me find my wallet...

353
00:20:18,863 --> 00:20:20,736
Just give him the damn TV.

354
00:20:39,429 --> 00:20:40,896
Look who's in the hospital.

355
00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:43,993
Stevie Kenarban.
What a surprise.

356
00:20:44,246 --> 00:20:46,449
Well, if you think I came down
here to feel sorry for you,

357
00:20:46,705 --> 00:20:48,145
you've got another think coming.

358
00:20:48,294 --> 00:20:51,893
'Cause I didn't feel sorry for you
when they bolted your spine or
you got that mold on your brain,

359
00:20:51,895 --> 00:20:53,450
and I'm not going to
feel sorry for you now.

360
00:20:53,749 --> 00:20:54,664
Glad you didn't die.

361
00:20:54,771 --> 00:20:55,621
See you when you get out.

362
00:21:00,812 --> 00:21:02,273
Oh, and here's your cookie.

363
00:21:07,983 --> 00:21:10,789
I told you... he'd come.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
