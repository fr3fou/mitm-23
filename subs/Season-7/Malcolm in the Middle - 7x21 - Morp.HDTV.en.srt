1
00:00:04,463 --> 00:00:05,846
Man, I hate finals.

2
00:00:06,217 --> 00:00:07,649
I was up all night studying.

3
00:00:08,063 --> 00:00:09,535
Not me, I slept like a baby.

4
00:00:10,917 --> 00:00:11,574
What are you doing?

5
00:00:11,703 --> 00:00:14,113
Just making sure I know the
answers for my history test today.

6
00:00:15,655 --> 00:00:17,457
There's more than one way
to be a genius, Malcolm.

7
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:29,650
Malcolm in the Middle
7.21 - "Morp"

8
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:40,650
Synchronisation par Max & Tyno,

& Malcolm-France.com

10
00:00:57,303 --> 00:00:58,720
Hey, Dewey, what have you got there?

11
00:00:58,778 --> 00:01:01,161
I have to do an autobiography
for my English class,

12
00:01:01,171 --> 00:01:03,851
and my teacher wants me to include
a few pictures from my early childhood.

13
00:01:03,878 --> 00:01:05,546
Well, it looks like you have
a lot to choose from.

14
00:01:05,621 --> 00:01:08,239
Yeah. You guys really did
a great job with Francis...

15
00:01:10,551 --> 00:01:11,323
And Reese...

16
00:01:13,191 --> 00:01:14,145
And Malcolm.

17
00:01:15,866 --> 00:01:18,281
Now why don't we take a look
at a few of my precious memories.

18
00:01:26,677 --> 00:01:27,426
Spider.

19
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:29,562
There.

20
00:01:30,046 --> 00:01:31,221
Now we have that memory.

21
00:01:32,378 --> 00:01:35,793
Will you stop feeling sorry for
yourself, there must be a hundreds
of pictures of you in here.

22
00:01:44,222 --> 00:01:47,960
Well, here is poor, neglected Dewey
having great time at SeaWorld.

23
00:01:48,582 --> 00:01:50,251
It's so blurry, you can't
even tell that's me.

24
00:01:50,335 --> 00:01:51,618
Well, you can't prove it's not.

25
00:01:51,793 --> 00:01:54,717
Dewey, at least we got you a memory book.
That's more than we've done for Jamie.

26
00:01:54,946 --> 00:01:57,613
And I suppose that makes you
feel pretty good about yourselves.

27
00:01:57,619 --> 00:01:58,616
You want to know the truth?

28
00:01:58,956 --> 00:02:00,268
You were the fourth child.

29
00:02:00,272 --> 00:02:03,247
By the time you came along, this house
was in a state of complete chaos.

30
00:02:03,425 --> 00:02:06,369
The only sleep I got was when
I'd nod off on the drive to work.

31
00:02:06,574 --> 00:02:10,988
So forgive us if we didn't get
a chance to take every picture, every
video, or get you every vaccination.

32
00:02:11,113 --> 00:02:12,962
-I wasn't vaccinated?
-Tell you what, Dewey.

33
00:02:12,969 --> 00:02:15,560
You get whooping cough,
I promise I'll take a ton of pictures.

34
00:02:21,629 --> 00:02:22,451
You won't believe it!

35
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:25,575
I just got asked to the
prom by Nick Tompkins!

36
00:02:27,372 --> 00:02:29,648
Oh, great, it's prom time already.

37
00:02:29,989 --> 00:02:33,593
An evening of posers and phonies out
to make the rest of us feel like crap.

38
00:02:34,027 --> 00:02:36,817
It's just like every other day of high
school, except it costs a thousand dollars.

39
00:02:38,142 --> 00:02:39,229
That's inspired.

40
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,588
"A Night To Cherish"?

41
00:02:40,696 --> 00:02:43,957
It makes last year's "A Night To
Remember" seem so shallow.

42
00:02:44,078 --> 00:02:46,081
Yeah, I wouldn't expect you
to show up, anyway, Carla.

43
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:48,212
You'll probably be home
alone in your room,

44
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:51,901
listening to Morrissey and gouging out the
eyes of the models in Vogue magazine.

45
00:02:52,117 --> 00:02:54,616
Aw, does this mean we're
not best friends anymore?

46
00:02:59,277 --> 00:03:00,010
That was great.

47
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:00,921
You're Carla, right?

48
00:03:01,118 --> 00:03:03,125
The one who read the phone
book out loud at the talent show.

49
00:03:03,272 --> 00:03:05,594
Yeah. I was surprised they let
me get all the way to the B's.

50
00:03:06,984 --> 00:03:08,336
You know what sucks about this school?

51
00:03:08,373 --> 00:03:13,784
Students, teachers, the textbooks,
the asbestos-filled building and
the toxic dump it's built on?

52
00:03:14,651 --> 00:03:18,070
Well, that, plus they never offer
anything for people like us to do.

53
00:03:18,667 --> 00:03:19,614
You know what would be cool?

54
00:03:19,923 --> 00:03:22,546
If there was a party that was the
complete opposite of the prom.

55
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:24,266
You mean like a "morp."

56
00:03:24,426 --> 00:03:24,802
What?

57
00:03:25,008 --> 00:03:26,825
A morp, the complete
opposite of the prom.

58
00:03:27,002 --> 00:03:29,136
Morp. I like that.

59
00:03:29,323 --> 00:03:33,255
Yeah, instead of paying $500 for a dress,
we could just wear jeans and a sweatshirt.

60
00:03:33,382 --> 00:03:35,242
And instead of a limo,
we can all just take the bus.

61
00:03:35,804 --> 00:03:36,892
We should totally do this.

62
00:03:37,109 --> 00:03:38,087
-Can I get your number?
-Sure.

63
00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:45,597
It wasn't me who threw
that pudding at you!

64
00:03:45,749 --> 00:03:48,478
Well, you should have thought of that before
you started looking like the guy who did!

65
00:03:49,784 --> 00:03:50,432
Excuse me?

66
00:03:51,647 --> 00:03:52,651
You're Reese, aren't you?

67
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:53,986
Wait a second, I'm in
the middle of something.

68
00:03:59,226 --> 00:04:02,331
Don't worry, somebody will find you,
they do drug searches on Fridays.

69
00:04:02,814 --> 00:04:03,472
Okay, what?

70
00:04:03,828 --> 00:04:04,880
What are you doing prom night?

71
00:04:05,145 --> 00:04:06,116
That's a Saturday.

72
00:04:07,053 --> 00:04:08,570
I'll be throwing shopping
carts into the reservoir.

73
00:04:09,053 --> 00:04:09,875
My name is Jeanie.

74
00:04:10,091 --> 00:04:12,873
For the past four years, I've been
super-focused on keeping a perfect GPA.

75
00:04:13,218 --> 00:04:15,083
But now that I've got my
acceptance letter from Brown,

76
00:04:15,101 --> 00:04:17,361
I feel like I've got some time to
experience high school social life.

77
00:04:17,764 --> 00:04:18,884
So I want you to
take me to the prom.

78
00:04:20,145 --> 00:04:22,300
Yeah... that sounds like
a fun night, except...

79
00:04:22,602 --> 00:04:25,305
the next morning I wake up like an idiot
with no shopping carts in the reservoir.

80
00:04:25,601 --> 00:04:26,657
I'll pay you $200.

81
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,550
Two hundred dollars?!

82
00:04:28,892 --> 00:04:29,969
Just to go out on a date?

83
00:04:30,502 --> 00:04:32,619
And the career counselor said
I should be a mechanic.

84
00:04:33,284 --> 00:04:34,915
I can't wait to throw
this in his face.

85
00:04:36,681 --> 00:04:37,155
Yeah...

86
00:04:38,849 --> 00:04:40,137
You're basically a tear down,

87
00:04:40,906 --> 00:04:42,493
but I think I can get you ready.

88
00:04:42,854 --> 00:04:43,941
Meet me here tomorrow at 3:00.

89
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:46,155
How sweet is this?

90
00:04:46,243 --> 00:04:47,421
<i>I think she likes you.</i>

91
00:04:52,263 --> 00:04:56,424
You know, I felt pretty bad after our
little conversation the other day. So...

92
00:04:57,144 --> 00:05:01,929
I did a little poking around the garage
myself, and you'll never guess what I found.

93
00:05:04,498 --> 00:05:05,753
Dewey's artwork.

94
00:05:07,241 --> 00:05:08,612
Kindergarten, first grade.

95
00:05:08,615 --> 00:05:10,336
Oh, look, art camp.

96
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:11,237
It's all here.

97
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,467
Sorry, Dad, I don't
know what to say.

98
00:05:15,936 --> 00:05:17,678
Wait a minute, here's
a drawing I did of Grandma.

99
00:05:17,768 --> 00:05:19,008
And it's beautiful.

100
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:21,368
You did a really nice job
with her whiskey bottle.

101
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,694
I also have her missing a leg.

102
00:05:25,363 --> 00:05:27,895
Interesting, since she didn't
lose it until last year.

103
00:05:31,249 --> 00:05:34,045
Dewey, if you're trying to tell me
that you can predict the future...

104
00:05:34,047 --> 00:05:35,809
So you're neglectful, and
you think I'm an idiot.

105
00:05:35,936 --> 00:05:36,631
That's nice.

106
00:05:38,289 --> 00:05:41,212
I spent over an hour on
this rainbow, Dewey!

107
00:05:43,527 --> 00:05:45,520
You're not an easy
boy to love, you know!

108
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:48,789
Thanks for coming to the meeting.

109
00:05:49,222 --> 00:05:53,015
This morp of ours is going to
blow those prom zombies away.

110
00:05:53,217 --> 00:05:54,412
Do we have to call it a meeting?

111
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,579
That sounds like something the
dance committee would call it.

112
00:05:57,055 --> 00:05:58,689
Okay, you're totally right,
this isn't a meeting.

113
00:05:58,693 --> 00:06:00,671
But I still think that we need
to have some sort of plan.

114
00:06:00,816 --> 00:06:02,168
Hey, how crazy is this?

115
00:06:02,274 --> 00:06:04,640
So you know how everyone wears
formal clothes the prom, right?

116
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:08,159
So how about if we all went naked?

117
00:06:09,715 --> 00:06:11,385
I'm not sure that's
such a good idea.

118
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,281
Can we go naked?

119
00:06:12,775 --> 00:06:14,221
-No.
-Here we go.

120
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:17,216
King Malcolm handing down
his rules from the mountaintop.

121
00:06:17,912 --> 00:06:19,060
Will there be uniforms?

122
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:20,613
Little flags with
your picture on them?

123
00:06:20,817 --> 00:06:25,467
A.J., you moron, the can drive was not
a fascist conspiracy, and neither is this.

124
00:06:25,524 --> 00:06:26,318
Oh, my God.

125
00:06:26,547 --> 00:06:29,945
The backbiting, the name-calling...
this is just like French club!

126
00:06:29,975 --> 00:06:32,279
Exactly. This is turning out
like every other school event.

127
00:06:32,404 --> 00:06:34,552
We got some weasly tyrant
pushing everybody around.

128
00:06:34,555 --> 00:06:35,651
The scared masses.

129
00:06:35,693 --> 00:06:37,283
A poet willing to speak the truth.

130
00:06:37,573 --> 00:06:40,042
I say we should all be free to make
our own anti-prom statement.

131
00:06:40,178 --> 00:06:41,934
And each choose our
own location to do it in.

132
00:06:42,054 --> 00:06:45,067
In other words, we all stay home on
prom night like we do every year?

133
00:06:46,293 --> 00:06:47,241
That'll send a message.

134
00:06:47,961 --> 00:06:52,025
Look, guys, the morp is too
good of an idea to let personality
conflicts get in the way.

135
00:06:52,227 --> 00:06:54,491
We have been outsiders that
have never belonged to anything.

136
00:06:54,573 --> 00:06:57,297
And now, for one night,
we can be a part of something.

137
00:06:57,872 --> 00:07:00,452
And do it in a way that allows
us to all to be individuals.

138
00:07:02,176 --> 00:07:02,927
Malcolm's right.

139
00:07:03,203 --> 00:07:04,253
Let's make this happen.

140
00:07:05,277 --> 00:07:06,812
I have an idea
for refreshments.

141
00:07:07,025 --> 00:07:10,216
What if we get a big punch bowl,
and then we all drink punch.

142
00:07:11,236 --> 00:07:12,825
You know, ironically.

143
00:07:14,248 --> 00:07:15,740
I guess I could write our manifesto.

144
00:07:16,146 --> 00:07:17,546
I've already got the
first 1,500 pages.

145
00:07:17,667 --> 00:07:18,327
That's great.

146
00:07:18,528 --> 00:07:20,815
And I'll arrange for us to use the
boiler room in the basement.

147
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:23,395
The only problem is, it's full of desks.
We'll have to move all those out.

148
00:07:23,697 --> 00:07:24,655
Who's got Friday night open?

149
00:07:26,869 --> 00:07:28,235
Let's review the evening.

150
00:07:29,481 --> 00:07:30,622
What time do you pick me up?

151
00:07:31,466 --> 00:07:32,944
I ring your doorbell at 6:00.

152
00:07:33,133 --> 00:07:34,942
I'm prompt because
it's a sign of respect.

153
00:07:35,073 --> 00:07:36,432
And when you get to my house...

154
00:07:36,699 --> 00:07:37,133
I know.

155
00:07:37,502 --> 00:07:38,688
No throwing eggs at the door.

156
00:07:39,094 --> 00:07:40,074
Also a sign of respect.

157
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:42,854
And when we're at the dance, and
it's time to say something nice,

158
00:07:42,943 --> 00:07:43,995
what do you say?

159
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:47,535
I don't know, "Thanks for shaving?"

160
00:07:47,747 --> 00:07:49,229
-We went over this!
-Right, right, right.

161
00:07:50,986 --> 00:07:53,285
"Every time I look at you you
somehow become more beautiful."

162
00:07:54,718 --> 00:07:55,421
His teeth are done.

163
00:07:59,849 --> 00:08:00,677
They're not white enough.

164
00:08:01,053 --> 00:08:03,203
Don't you people realize that
we're running out of time here?

165
00:08:03,818 --> 00:08:04,425
Look at this.

166
00:08:04,614 --> 00:08:05,973
He's not even close.

167
00:08:06,327 --> 00:08:09,241
I want his face flawless,
his hair shorter and shinier.

168
00:08:09,602 --> 00:08:10,702
He's an illiterate thug.

169
00:08:10,832 --> 00:08:12,748
I don't think it's too much to
ask that he looks perfect!

170
00:08:16,093 --> 00:08:16,944
You heard the lady.

171
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:18,218
Make me glow.

172
00:08:19,776 --> 00:08:23,457
Lois, I don't want to alarm you, but
there is a naked man in your house!

173
00:08:23,511 --> 00:08:24,508
<i>What took you so long?</i>

174
00:08:24,565 --> 00:08:26,810
<i>The boys left for the
prom a half hour ago.</i>

175
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:30,294
Yeah, I know, I got a flat tire on
my way to Jamie's babysitter.

176
00:08:30,837 --> 00:08:32,354
I had to drive back on the rim.

177
00:08:32,613 --> 00:08:35,659
There were a lot of sparks, but
I don't think anything caught fire.

178
00:08:37,236 --> 00:08:38,826
The main thing is
that you and I have...

179
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:39,727
Dewey!

180
00:08:40,114 --> 00:08:40,902
What are you doing here?

181
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:42,723
I live here.

182
00:08:42,861 --> 00:08:44,126
Honey, Dewey's here!

183
00:08:44,216 --> 00:08:45,364
<i>What's he doing here?</i>

184
00:08:45,465 --> 00:08:46,845
Don't you have a prom to go to?

185
00:08:47,269 --> 00:08:48,195
I'm not in high school.

186
00:08:48,886 --> 00:08:50,679
He says he's not in high school!

187
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:53,452
<i>Oh, for God sakes, Hal, we're just
going to have to take a raincheck.</i>

188
00:08:53,624 --> 00:08:54,065
No!

189
00:08:54,352 --> 00:08:56,489
Okay, look, I'm very sorry,
but you got to get out of here.

190
00:08:56,497 --> 00:08:56,795
What?

191
00:08:57,199 --> 00:08:59,013
But I'm researching
a history report on-ine.

192
00:08:59,023 --> 00:09:00,422
If it's money you want, you got it.

193
00:09:02,243 --> 00:09:04,061
Here, you ought to be able
to have a good time with that.

194
00:09:05,926 --> 00:09:08,085
You can go to a movie, grab a burger.

195
00:09:08,122 --> 00:09:09,699
Hey, the Hyatt has a piano bar.

196
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:11,149
-But I don't have any shoes.
-Buy some!

197
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:11,975
I love you, son.

198
00:09:12,007 --> 00:09:14,507
Listen, maybe we'll go to the zoo
sometime, huh? Just you and me!

199
00:09:22,694 --> 00:09:24,606
Wow. Quite a turnout.

200
00:09:25,072 --> 00:09:25,491
Yeah.

201
00:09:26,067 --> 00:09:27,771
We even got three home-schooled kids.

202
00:09:30,191 --> 00:09:31,544
Here, Carla, hey, Malcolm.

203
00:09:31,843 --> 00:09:32,742
Have some punch.

204
00:09:33,106 --> 00:09:34,718
There's nothing in there.

205
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,363
I know.

206
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:38,997
It's a statement about how completely
empty the real prom experience is.

207
00:09:39,968 --> 00:09:41,127
The cookies are just cookies.

208
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:43,566
I love your wrist corsage.

209
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,872
Yeah. I found it in
the crisper drawer.

210
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:47,066
Good job, guys.

211
00:09:47,554 --> 00:09:49,475
This sucks the least of anything
I've ever done in my life.

212
00:09:49,751 --> 00:09:51,801
I met a guy here who hates
Starbucks more than I do.

213
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:55,767
This is fantastic, Malcolm.

214
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:59,213
All these people would have been home
tonight feeling lonely and miserable.

215
00:09:59,913 --> 00:10:01,227
You should feel really proud.

216
00:10:01,847 --> 00:10:02,641
Yeah, I guess.

217
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:04,006
What do you mean "you guess"?

218
00:10:05,243 --> 00:10:06,531
I know, I know, it just...

219
00:10:07,377 --> 00:10:08,460
I thought it would feel better.

220
00:10:08,918 --> 00:10:09,795
There's something missing.

221
00:10:10,872 --> 00:10:12,630
I didn't see the schedule of events.

222
00:10:13,225 --> 00:10:14,778
What time is everyone
going to nude up?

223
00:10:20,015 --> 00:10:21,373
I just have to come out and say it.

224
00:10:23,116 --> 00:10:26,621
I was incredible, and you
were no slouch yourself.

225
00:10:26,624 --> 00:10:29,171
I'm the lucky one, Hal.
All I had to do was show up.

226
00:10:32,848 --> 00:10:33,733
Did you hear the phone ring?

227
00:10:34,038 --> 00:10:36,140
Hal, I couldn't have heard
the space shuttle land.

228
00:10:37,886 --> 00:10:39,829
<i>Hi. This is Dewey. Remember me?</i>

229
00:10:40,271 --> 00:10:41,322
<i>Your fourth son?</i>

230
00:10:42,522 --> 00:10:44,300
<i>Nah, I don't expect you to miss me,</i>

231
00:10:44,533 --> 00:10:47,852
<i>but at some point, Dad, you may
miss the wallet you threw at me,</i>

232
00:10:48,726 --> 00:10:50,683
You gave him your wallet?!

233
00:10:50,927 --> 00:10:54,536
<i>So here's the deal: If you'd like to see
all your money and credit cards again...</i>

234
00:10:54,542 --> 00:10:55,072
Wait a minute.

235
00:10:55,545 --> 00:10:57,103
That bell ringing in the background.

236
00:10:57,124 --> 00:10:58,289
I know I've heard that before!

237
00:10:58,802 --> 00:11:01,096
<i>So here's the deal: If
you'd like to see all your...</i>

238
00:11:01,386 --> 00:11:02,681
That is Saint Matthew's.

239
00:11:02,917 --> 00:11:03,787
No, wait.

240
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:05,543
Saint Luke's on Third.

241
00:11:05,792 --> 00:11:07,210
It's definitely a Lutheran bell.

242
00:11:07,622 --> 00:11:12,170
<i>If you'd like to see your all your money
and credit cards again, meet me where
they're building the new library,</i>

243
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:14,002
<i>at the corner of Washington and Olive.</i>

244
00:11:14,005 --> 00:11:14,784
Ah! That's it!

245
00:11:20,892 --> 00:11:22,586
Dinner and the limo were fantastic,

246
00:11:22,797 --> 00:11:23,852
and your parents were delightful.

247
00:11:24,001 --> 00:11:25,574
You didn't tell me that
they were Asian, too.

248
00:11:25,827 --> 00:11:26,910
Here come Mike and Anna.

249
00:11:27,362 --> 00:11:29,462
Just smile and don't be yourself.

250
00:11:29,594 --> 00:11:30,394
Hi, Jeanie.

251
00:11:32,182 --> 00:11:33,279
Is that Reese?

252
00:11:33,475 --> 00:11:35,243
Hello, it is such
a pleasure to see you.

253
00:11:35,715 --> 00:11:36,515
So you've met.

254
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:39,516
Yeah, he steals my lunch every day
and throws me in a garbage can.

255
00:11:39,737 --> 00:11:42,096
Your mother makes a
marvelous tuna fish sandwich.

256
00:11:42,332 --> 00:11:43,232
Give her my best, will you?

257
00:11:44,619 --> 00:11:45,928
I've never seen Reese so...

258
00:11:46,382 --> 00:11:47,653
un-psycho-like before.

259
00:11:47,732 --> 00:11:51,335
How could I be anything but a perfect gentleman
around someone as breathtaking as Jeanie?

260
00:11:56,324 --> 00:11:57,343
-Bye. See ya.
-See ya.

261
00:11:58,874 --> 00:12:00,379
Reese, that wasn't in the script.

262
00:12:00,664 --> 00:12:02,126
I'm sorry. Are you going
to spray me again?

263
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:05,344
No, it was actually really nice.

264
00:12:05,539 --> 00:12:06,369
I liked it.

265
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:09,937
Would you like to have
this dance with me?

266
00:12:10,133 --> 00:12:11,066
I'd be delighted.

267
00:12:15,355 --> 00:12:16,768
You can go ahead and grab my butt.

268
00:12:17,057 --> 00:12:17,801
You're paying for it.

269
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:28,432
Now, remember, we only have to
be nice to him until he gets close
enough to the van to grab him.

270
00:12:30,486 --> 00:12:34,151
Do you folks have a young
boy you don't care about?

271
00:12:34,844 --> 00:12:35,230
What?

272
00:12:35,526 --> 00:12:37,640
He wanted me to give you this.

273
00:12:43,608 --> 00:12:45,667
You see the way Dewey's
throwing around my money?

274
00:12:45,933 --> 00:12:47,089
He has minions!

275
00:12:48,675 --> 00:12:51,041
Oh, well, at least he
returned my HMO card.

276
00:12:51,715 --> 00:12:54,954
"If you want another..." Oh, great!
If I want another piece of my wallet,

277
00:12:55,154 --> 00:12:57,294
we have to meet him at the
corner of Temple and Fourth,

278
00:12:57,753 --> 00:12:59,528
"Wear what's in the bag."

279
00:13:00,762 --> 00:13:02,536
Oh! Will you look at this?

280
00:13:03,575 --> 00:13:07,022
It's bad enough we have to traipse
all over town looking for him,
now we have to dress up?!

281
00:13:07,232 --> 00:13:09,153
How's he even gonna know
if we're wearing this?

282
00:13:09,157 --> 00:13:09,784
I'll tell you how.

283
00:13:10,169 --> 00:13:12,216
The little monster
has a camera in here.

284
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:19,489
If you think you're going to make a fool out
of me, I've got news for you, little man:

285
00:13:19,579 --> 00:13:20,851
It's not going to happen!

286
00:13:30,094 --> 00:13:31,569
Malcolm, I don't understand this.

287
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:34,933
The morp is going great downstairs.
Why do we have to come up here?

288
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:36,351
It finally hit me:

289
00:13:36,756 --> 00:13:38,605
These people have to know that
we're having a good time without them.

290
00:13:39,192 --> 00:13:40,401
Why do you care what they think?

291
00:13:40,969 --> 00:13:43,191
I don't care, but I want
them to know I don't care.

292
00:13:44,964 --> 00:13:45,549
Perfect.

293
00:13:50,869 --> 00:13:51,576
Hey, Malcolm.

294
00:13:51,803 --> 00:13:52,830
Isn't this a great party?

295
00:13:52,914 --> 00:13:55,842
Open your eyes, Reese. Everything
about this night is completely phony.

296
00:13:56,789 --> 00:14:00,959
Maybe it is phony, but maybe
something that starts out as phony
can turn into something real.

297
00:14:03,105 --> 00:14:04,324
You may call this corny, Malcolm,

298
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:06,858
but this really is a night to cherish.

299
00:14:08,037 --> 00:14:08,846
Reese...

300
00:14:16,471 --> 00:14:18,137
Sorry, Steve, official prom business.

301
00:14:19,341 --> 00:14:20,724
Can I have your attention, everybody?

302
00:14:24,421 --> 00:14:26,139
I just thought you people should know

303
00:14:26,619 --> 00:14:31,830
that while you're up here enjoying what
you have deluded yourselves into thinking
is the greatest night of your lives,

304
00:14:32,421 --> 00:14:35,907
<i>the people who you've excluded from
this charade are downstairs right now,</i>

305
00:14:36,252 --> 00:14:38,473
having a party that obliterates yours.

306
00:14:40,686 --> 00:14:44,066
You think you're on the inside,
but you're on the outside.

307
00:14:46,696 --> 00:14:48,252
How does that make you feel?

308
00:14:52,624 --> 00:14:53,734
<i>*I feel good*</i>

309
00:14:55,985 --> 00:14:57,438
<i>*I knew that I would know*</i>

310
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:00,843
<i>*I feel good*</i>

311
00:15:02,522 --> 00:15:03,950
<i>*I knew that I would know*</i>

312
00:15:06,358 --> 00:15:07,149
<i>*So good*</i>

313
00:15:08,069 --> 00:15:08,840
<i>*So good*</i>

314
00:15:09,401 --> 00:15:10,451
<i>*I got you*</i>

315
00:15:12,866 --> 00:15:14,575
<i>This is our fifth stop, Hal.</i>

316
00:15:14,597 --> 00:15:15,843
Is this gonna go on all night?

317
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:17,378
Well, he's certainly dragging it out.

318
00:15:17,617 --> 00:15:19,943
So far, all he's given me
back from my wallet is crap!

319
00:15:20,431 --> 00:15:23,465
I got my library card,
my organ donor card...

320
00:15:23,852 --> 00:15:25,881
Oh, wait, he did give
me back my tip chart.

321
00:15:26,074 --> 00:15:29,353
God knows how much of your money
he's spent on presents and party supplies.

322
00:15:29,357 --> 00:15:30,663
So Dewey wants a party?

323
00:15:30,952 --> 00:15:32,840
You hold him down,
I'll give him a party!

324
00:15:32,901 --> 00:15:34,410
-<i>Can I help you?</i>
-Oh, uh...

325
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:36,038
Yes, uh...

326
00:15:36,457 --> 00:15:38,334
"I'm Dewey's jackass father."

327
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:41,836
<i>-The sex maniacs are here!
-Cool!</i>

328
00:15:41,871 --> 00:15:45,544
<i>If you can keep your hands off your
wife long enough, pull up to the window.</i>

329
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:57,229
You guys were so much hotter in my
mind when Dewey told me the story.

330
00:15:57,297 --> 00:15:58,828
Just give us our stuff.

331
00:16:00,238 --> 00:16:00,959
Here you go.

332
00:16:08,939 --> 00:16:10,346
Ah, my driver's license.

333
00:16:10,691 --> 00:16:11,489
We're getting closer.

334
00:16:11,868 --> 00:16:12,582
Look at that.

335
00:16:12,948 --> 00:16:14,439
He drew a mustache on you.

336
00:16:14,893 --> 00:16:15,664
No, I did that.

337
00:16:17,432 --> 00:16:18,513
I wanted to see how it looked.

338
00:16:23,037 --> 00:16:24,687
-Punch?
-No, thanks.

339
00:16:25,306 --> 00:16:30,948
Look, I know that was embarrassing,
but all those people up there think
you're a creep, anyway, so nothing lost.

340
00:16:31,005 --> 00:16:31,769
I guess.

341
00:16:36,853 --> 00:16:38,537
Oh, my God!

342
00:16:41,589 --> 00:16:43,703
So there really is a party
going on down here.

343
00:16:44,439 --> 00:16:46,119
Look, we're having a great time.

344
00:16:46,349 --> 00:16:48,066
We're just enjoying just
being with each other.

345
00:16:48,177 --> 00:16:50,967
Yeah, but this place is
so dark and creepy.

346
00:16:51,273 --> 00:16:53,637
Didn't the janitor kill someone
down here a few years ago?

347
00:16:53,873 --> 00:16:56,980
Okay, you've come down to see the
freak show. You've had your fun.

348
00:16:57,385 --> 00:16:58,866
Why don't you leave us alone?

349
00:16:59,794 --> 00:17:00,300
You know what?

350
00:17:00,881 --> 00:17:02,802
You guys should just come upstairs.

351
00:17:03,983 --> 00:17:04,429
What?

352
00:17:04,518 --> 00:17:10,413
Yeah, there's only a month left of school,
and all this stuff about who's cool and who's
not, I mean, it's just kind of silly, isn't it?

353
00:17:11,181 --> 00:17:11,757
Oh, really?

354
00:17:11,897 --> 00:17:16,528
Was it silly in fourth grade, when
I was the only kid on our street you
didn't invite to your birthday party?

355
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:18,821
I sent you an invitation.

356
00:17:18,989 --> 00:17:20,675
-You stood me up.
-No, I didn't.

357
00:17:20,863 --> 00:17:22,457
I would have loved to have gone.

358
00:17:25,197 --> 00:17:26,758
-Oh, my God.
-Oh, my God.

359
00:17:30,495 --> 00:17:31,119
What are you doing?

360
00:17:31,558 --> 00:17:33,064
Suddenly a hug solves everything?

361
00:17:33,724 --> 00:17:35,936
Come on, guys, let's go to the prom.

362
00:17:37,711 --> 00:17:38,227
Carla?

363
00:17:42,115 --> 00:17:42,520
Heather?

364
00:17:43,295 --> 00:17:44,999
This isn't the way
I thought it would happen,

365
00:17:45,342 --> 00:17:48,295
but I just got asked to the prom!

366
00:17:51,385 --> 00:17:52,809
A.J., you can't be serious.

367
00:17:52,938 --> 00:17:55,981
Hey, it took guts for those girls
to come down here and apologize.

368
00:17:56,749 --> 00:18:00,050
And I'd like to think I'm big enough
to be able to admit I'd like to
have sex with one of them.

369
00:18:02,371 --> 00:18:06,036
You can't just let them say "I'm sorry"
after 12 years of treating us like crap!

370
00:18:06,515 --> 00:18:08,459
Wait a minute, they never even said "sorry!"

371
00:18:08,585 --> 00:18:09,606
This is a trap!

372
00:18:10,104 --> 00:18:13,632
These are the same people who made
fun of your clothes all through school,

373
00:18:13,815 --> 00:18:17,302
and laughed at your haircuts, and
called you Malcolm-Balcolm!

374
00:18:19,246 --> 00:18:20,451
You'll be sorry!

375
00:18:24,173 --> 00:18:24,909
Finally.

376
00:18:26,211 --> 00:18:28,036
Now we've got some
breathing room in here.

377
00:18:30,616 --> 00:18:32,649
<i>*She doesn't wait for me*</i>

378
00:18:34,317 --> 00:18:36,503
<i>*And now that she's gone*</i>

379
00:18:38,104 --> 00:18:40,696
<i>*I feel that she'll never be*</i>

380
00:18:42,184 --> 00:18:44,287
<i>*Back in my arms*</i>
-You're a really good dancer.

381
00:18:44,486 --> 00:18:46,465
When I'm with you, it doesn't
even feel like we're dancing.

382
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:47,607
It's like we're floating.

383
00:18:48,363 --> 00:18:49,944
I misjudged you, Reese.

384
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:54,054
I just chose you because you
weren't completely hideous,
and I knew you wouldn't have a date.

385
00:18:54,831 --> 00:18:56,530
But you're so much more than that.

386
00:18:57,238 --> 00:18:59,154
You've made me feel wonderful.

387
00:18:59,976 --> 00:19:01,704
It's been a really great
night for me, too.

388
00:19:02,563 --> 00:19:04,782
You helped me find a little part of me
that I didn't even know was there,

389
00:19:05,707 --> 00:19:07,643
the part that isn't a gigantic jackass.

390
00:19:08,521 --> 00:19:09,252
You know...

391
00:19:10,032 --> 00:19:12,300
I wasn't planning on the
night ending this way,

392
00:19:13,356 --> 00:19:14,974
but why don't we get out of here,

393
00:19:15,658 --> 00:19:19,350
grab a blanket and a bottle
of wine and go to the beach.

394
00:19:19,711 --> 00:19:21,217
-You mean it?
-Yes, Reese.

395
00:19:22,243 --> 00:19:23,465
I really want you.

396
00:19:30,927 --> 00:19:32,143
It's 12:00 already?

397
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:34,100
Too bad, I was having fun.

398
00:19:34,532 --> 00:19:35,333
Well, see you at school.

399
00:19:35,855 --> 00:19:36,971
Reese, where are you going?

400
00:19:37,758 --> 00:19:39,248
It's midnight. I'm off the clock.

401
00:19:40,043 --> 00:19:40,991
But what about us?

402
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,497
And all those things you said?

403
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:45,149
Well, if I want to make a career out
of this, I've gotta satisfy my customers.

404
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:46,836
And I think I did.

405
00:19:47,347 --> 00:19:48,039
Tell your friends.

406
00:19:50,737 --> 00:19:54,497
Why do we have to haul all this
stuff in here when we have no
intention of giving him a party?

407
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,989
We have to humor him until he reveals
himself. This has got to be the place.

408
00:20:00,774 --> 00:20:01,851
There you are!

409
00:20:01,892 --> 00:20:03,799
You are in so much
trouble, young man!

410
00:20:03,812 --> 00:20:05,266
I want my wallet now.

411
00:20:05,647 --> 00:20:06,020
Here.

412
00:20:06,932 --> 00:20:09,318
At least we got here before
you spent all my cash.

413
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:12,007
It cost so much to keep this
place open after hours,

414
00:20:12,248 --> 00:20:13,544
I had to put that on your credit card.

415
00:20:14,496 --> 00:20:15,859
Okay, Mr. smart guy.

416
00:20:16,145 --> 00:20:18,484
Now you can help us load
all this stuff back in the car.

417
00:20:18,643 --> 00:20:21,102
I know you think you're having
a party, but you can forget about it.

418
00:20:21,644 --> 00:20:22,421
This isn't for me.

419
00:20:22,922 --> 00:20:26,009
It's too late for my childhood,
but it's not too late for his.

420
00:20:27,385 --> 00:20:28,093
Jamie?

421
00:20:28,688 --> 00:20:29,361
<i>Here's a camera.</i>

422
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:33,166
So now you have no excuse
for not documenting every
important event in Jamie's life.

423
00:20:34,213 --> 00:20:35,530
Starting tonight with his party.

424
00:20:35,926 --> 00:20:38,104
This is a really nice camera.
How could you afford...?

425
00:20:38,963 --> 00:20:39,511
Right.

426
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:46,425
Here, sweetie.

427
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:48,346
Let's go have some cake.

428
00:20:54,997 --> 00:20:56,563
That was a good thing you did, son.

429
00:20:57,041 --> 00:20:57,601
Thanks.

430
00:20:57,870 --> 00:20:58,835
Enjoy the cake.

431
00:20:59,115 --> 00:21:03,158
That's the last thing you're going
to eat in a long time that hasn't
been dipped in sardine juice.

432
00:21:05,203 --> 00:21:06,425
Hey! Finally!

433
00:21:06,521 --> 00:21:07,945
A picture for your memory book.
