1
00:00:00,305 --> 00:00:02,185
You're the one who
invited your friend over.

2
00:00:02,529 --> 00:00:05,125
Now that he's here, you can't
just suddenly change your mind.

3
00:00:05,221 --> 00:00:06,971
Now get up and
be nice to Ryan.

4
00:00:08,839 --> 00:00:09,547
Fine.

5
00:00:12,263 --> 00:00:12,943
Hi, Ryan.

6
00:00:13,802 --> 00:00:14,509
You want a beer?

00:00:24,225 --> 00:00:30,225

10
00:00:53,551 --> 00:00:55,038
You look pretty dumb
in those glasses.

11
00:00:55,129 --> 00:00:55,480
Oh, yeah?

12
00:00:56,019 --> 00:00:57,910
Well, I read a book
about poker tells,

13
00:00:57,913 --> 00:01:00,361
and my eyes have been
giving away my cards.

14
00:01:00,637 --> 00:01:04,596
We'll see who looks dumb when I am
dancing on a mountain of poker chips.

15
00:01:07,055 --> 00:01:08,079
-I'm out.
-Me, too.

16
00:01:08,263 --> 00:01:09,434
-Fold.
-Damn!

17
00:01:09,803 --> 00:01:10,646
Gentlemen.

18
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:11,773
Fiddle Faddle!

19
00:01:11,902 --> 00:01:13,214
Now it's a poker game.

20
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:15,440
Easy there.

21
00:01:15,965 --> 00:01:16,595
I can't help it.

22
00:01:16,943 --> 00:01:18,879
Kitty's got me on an extreme diet.

23
00:01:19,186 --> 00:01:21,130
-Hey, this isn't Fiddle Faddle.
-I make it at home.

24
00:01:21,442 --> 00:01:24,456
I pop some corn, brush some
melted caramel on it, let it cure,

25
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:26,647
<i>blanch and double
roast the nuts.</i>

26
00:01:26,917 --> 00:01:29,682
You lose a weekend, but
you save 73 cents a batch.

27
00:01:31,028 --> 00:01:31,658
I'll bet a buck.

28
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:33,049
-I'm out.
-Fold.

29
00:01:33,155 --> 00:01:33,763
Me, too.

30
00:01:34,154 --> 00:01:36,382
Damn, you could see through
these glasses, can't you?

31
00:01:39,463 --> 00:01:40,313
Oh! Oh, my tooth!

32
00:01:40,373 --> 00:01:42,678
Please, let the dentist take a look.

33
00:01:43,426 --> 00:01:44,112
It's this one.

34
00:01:45,038 --> 00:01:47,376
Uh-oh, #31 is cracked.

35
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,893
-Is that important?
-Only for eating and talking.

36
00:01:50,118 --> 00:01:51,235
It's one of the glory boys.

37
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:52,643
You better get that fixed.

38
00:01:53,137 --> 00:01:53,594
Great.

39
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:55,847
My company doesn't have
a dental plan anymore.

40
00:01:56,329 --> 00:01:58,251
They got us a foosball table instead.

41
00:01:58,258 --> 00:01:59,375
So where you been going?

42
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:01,480
The dental college. It's not too bad,

43
00:02:01,999 --> 00:02:03,534
but they do make you
sign a death waiver.

44
00:02:03,668 --> 00:02:04,622
Forget about that.

45
00:02:04,937 --> 00:02:07,185
Come by my office on Monday,
and I'll take care of it.

46
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,805
-Really?
-Absolutely.

47
00:02:08,858 --> 00:02:11,536
Wow, it's been so many years
since I've been to a real dentist.

48
00:02:12,313 --> 00:02:14,746
Do you supply the ether rag,
or should I bring my own?

49
00:02:17,038 --> 00:02:18,424
<i>God, I'm so bored.</i>

50
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:19,994
Everything's boring.

51
00:02:20,608 --> 00:02:23,069
It makes ditching school almost
seem like a bad choice.

52
00:02:23,262 --> 00:02:26,213
Even talking about
boring is getting boring.

53
00:02:26,462 --> 00:02:27,892
Yeah, boring.

54
00:02:28,093 --> 00:02:30,450
Bored, bored, bored, bored...

55
00:02:30,955 --> 00:02:32,782
-Wait! You see that?
-What?

56
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:34,175
It's a dead squirrel!

57
00:02:34,411 --> 00:02:36,341
Gentlemen, our week just filled up.

58
00:02:36,658 --> 00:02:37,968
Sorry, not interested.

59
00:02:38,587 --> 00:02:40,058
Sure, it looks good to you now,

60
00:02:40,396 --> 00:02:42,400
but it's just going to wind up
in the closet with all the others.

61
00:02:42,897 --> 00:02:43,597
Pass.

62
00:02:44,545 --> 00:02:45,236
Your loss.

63
00:02:45,745 --> 00:02:46,800
See you, suckers.

64
00:02:56,729 --> 00:02:57,335
Mom?

65
00:02:59,116 --> 00:03:00,543
Why aren't you in school?!

66
00:03:01,265 --> 00:03:02,719
You're in trouble, young man!

67
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,645
Oh, I don't think so.

68
00:03:04,963 --> 00:03:07,025
You're in the middle of an
alley trying to get on a bike.

69
00:03:07,371 --> 00:03:08,506
<i>You are ashamed of something.</i>

70
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,191
I can always smell shame.

71
00:03:10,507 --> 00:03:11,822
It's kind of like rotten coconut.

72
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:14,107
Okay.

73
00:03:14,475 --> 00:03:16,669
There's this stupid
bike-a-thon at work.

74
00:03:17,205 --> 00:03:20,199
Some idiot made a big stink about how
the store's not doing enough for charity.

75
00:03:20,869 --> 00:03:22,358
-Then don't do it.
-I have to.

76
00:03:22,516 --> 00:03:23,316
I'm the idiot.

77
00:03:24,056 --> 00:03:26,114
And I... I...

78
00:03:31,299 --> 00:03:32,518
I can't ride a bike...

79
00:03:32,993 --> 00:03:34,394
And it's very embarrassing.

80
00:03:35,095 --> 00:03:36,696
So you really can't ride a bike?

81
00:03:36,741 --> 00:03:37,241
No.

82
00:03:37,706 --> 00:03:39,474
Hey, everybody! My mom can't...

83
00:03:42,022 --> 00:03:43,027
You don't understand!

84
00:03:43,337 --> 00:03:46,270
My father didn't believe
in training wheels!

85
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:46,750
Mom!

86
00:03:46,758 --> 00:03:49,487
He just tied me to the bike
and pushed me down the hill.

87
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:50,907
Mom, there's glass down here!

88
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:53,988
I came back with three teeth in my hand,
and he just pushed me down all over again.

89
00:03:54,146 --> 00:03:56,606
After that, I just told people
I knew how to ride.

90
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:59,324
And I've been living
with this lie ever since!

91
00:03:59,397 --> 00:03:59,803
Mom!

92
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:02,958
If you tell anybody, I will kill you!

93
00:04:02,966 --> 00:04:05,075
-Do you hear me?
-I won't tell a soul!

94
00:04:05,232 --> 00:04:06,815
-Let me up, and I can help!
-What?!

95
00:04:06,887 --> 00:04:09,061
I know how to ride
a bike! I'll teach you!

96
00:04:12,766 --> 00:04:13,798
You'd really do that?

97
00:04:13,861 --> 00:04:16,026
Absolutely. And you don't
have to be embarrassed.

98
00:04:16,103 --> 00:04:18,307
No one will ever find
out your horrible secret.

99
00:04:19,874 --> 00:04:22,067
No, lady, I don't want your drugs!

100
00:04:28,493 --> 00:04:31,647
Wow, and I thought Reese
was the one dragging us down.

101
00:04:32,487 --> 00:04:34,399
Maybe we should see how
he's doing with his squirrel.

102
00:04:34,671 --> 00:04:37,022
If I know Reese, all the good
parts are gone by now.

103
00:04:38,424 --> 00:04:40,215
Nothing exciting ever
happens around here.

104
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:47,640
Wow...

105
00:04:48,776 --> 00:04:50,380
we even have boring miracles.

106
00:04:51,274 --> 00:04:53,056
It must have fallen from
a plane or something.

107
00:04:58,165 --> 00:05:00,123
Wow, this is brand-new.

108
00:05:01,107 --> 00:05:02,924
At least what I think a
mattress would look like new.

109
00:05:03,749 --> 00:05:06,091
-It's got no lumps.
-No weird stains.

110
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:07,576
No springs sticking out of it.

111
00:05:07,911 --> 00:05:09,256
-It's got tags!
-It's got tags!

112
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:12,893
It's like sitting on a cloud...

113
00:05:13,619 --> 00:05:14,924
with two clouds under it.

114
00:05:15,195 --> 00:05:16,088
This is amazing.

115
00:05:17,014 --> 00:05:18,335
I'm in ass heaven.

116
00:05:19,575 --> 00:05:20,575
Maybe it's worth some money.

117
00:05:21,349 --> 00:05:22,542
Sell it or keep it?

118
00:05:23,685 --> 00:05:24,942
Let's think about this for a second.

119
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,842
Oh, my God, we totally fell asleep.

120
00:05:34,817 --> 00:05:35,872
That wasn't sleep.

121
00:05:36,176 --> 00:05:38,372
Sleep makes you feel like
you've been beaten up.

122
00:05:38,942 --> 00:05:40,229
We got to keep this thing.

123
00:05:43,783 --> 00:05:45,634
Enjoying Lord of the Rings in high-def?

124
00:05:46,357 --> 00:05:48,231
Oh, it's unbelievable.

125
00:05:48,398 --> 00:05:50,392
No lines, no commercials...

126
00:05:50,857 --> 00:05:53,041
I'm bringing Lois here
for our anniversary.

127
00:05:54,202 --> 00:05:55,925
I still can't get over all this.

128
00:05:56,468 --> 00:05:57,958
A real sink to spit in.

129
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,943
I really don't have to swallow it.

130
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,218
Hal, are you crying?

131
00:06:02,358 --> 00:06:03,350
They're good tears.

132
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:05,869
How much longer will it take?

133
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:06,641
I'm done.

134
00:06:07,568 --> 00:06:08,398
You can't be.

135
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:10,839
I didn't bite down on the pain stick.

136
00:06:10,842 --> 00:06:13,785
No, it's done; I finally got
the temporary crown on.

137
00:06:14,341 --> 00:06:16,819
I got to tell you, Hal, it
was in pretty bad shape,

138
00:06:17,092 --> 00:06:19,864
but I think you're going
to be happy with the results.

139
00:06:20,005 --> 00:06:22,717
Wow, you really are a friend.

140
00:06:23,994 --> 00:06:25,785
Two thousand dollars?!

141
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,628
Excuse me, but this can't be right.

142
00:06:28,771 --> 00:06:30,726
Trey said he would take care of it.

143
00:06:30,773 --> 00:06:32,752
The doctor handed me the bill himself.

144
00:06:32,886 --> 00:06:33,736
You don't understand.

145
00:06:33,857 --> 00:06:35,285
I'm a friend of Trey's.

146
00:06:35,617 --> 00:06:38,419
And he gave you the friend
discount: ten percent.

147
00:06:38,468 --> 00:06:40,210
You mean he was going
to charge me more?!

148
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,207
Can I have the key to the bathroom?

149
00:06:41,211 --> 00:06:44,034
Careful, it'll cost you
$200 in a bathroom fee!

150
00:06:44,342 --> 00:06:44,859
You know what?

151
00:06:45,188 --> 00:06:49,128
You can tell Trey that this
is what I think of his bill.

152
00:06:50,547 --> 00:06:52,765
-That was your parking validation.
-I know.

153
00:06:55,762 --> 00:06:56,582
Could I have another one?

154
00:07:04,388 --> 00:07:04,974
Morning.

155
00:07:07,106 --> 00:07:08,107
Morning.

156
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:11,757
-Last night was...
-Fantastic.

157
00:07:12,997 --> 00:07:15,257
I'm glad we got these
600-thread-count sheets.

158
00:07:15,478 --> 00:07:18,747
Anything else would have been
an insult to this beautiful mattress.

159
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:21,334
We really have been living like beasts.

160
00:07:23,635 --> 00:07:24,871
A good night's sleep.

161
00:07:26,238 --> 00:07:28,536
Just think what we can do
with all this new energy.

162
00:07:29,602 --> 00:07:30,390
Yeah.

163
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,602
-Five more minutes?
-I'm right behind you, buddy.

164
00:07:53,547 --> 00:07:55,700
-See? Just do that.
-I can't.

165
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:57,609
-You want me to show you again?
-No, Reese.

166
00:07:57,908 --> 00:07:58,923
I'm afraid.

167
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:03,988
So you're chicken, huh?

168
00:08:04,023 --> 00:08:04,648
Yes!

169
00:08:05,009 --> 00:08:05,354
Oh.

170
00:08:06,901 --> 00:08:10,643
Mom, you might not know this, but
I used to be afraid of a lot of things.

171
00:08:11,171 --> 00:08:13,618
Thunder, frogs, mailboxes...

172
00:08:13,723 --> 00:08:15,302
You were afraid of mailboxes?

173
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,619
I used to imagine that if I stuck
my hand in a mailbox, it would
slam shut and rip my hand off,

174
00:08:19,768 --> 00:08:23,520
but I simply conquered my fear
by ripping the lid off of every
mailbox in the neighborhood.

175
00:08:23,905 --> 00:08:25,613
I turned that fear into hate.

176
00:08:26,127 --> 00:08:28,105
And you have to hate
that bike just as much.

177
00:08:28,712 --> 00:08:30,613
-I don't have hate.
-You've got hate in there.

178
00:08:30,667 --> 00:08:31,858
You just have to find it.

179
00:08:32,205 --> 00:08:32,882
Do you hate work?

180
00:08:33,703 --> 00:08:34,783
Surprisingly, no.

181
00:08:35,236 --> 00:08:36,106
What about your life?

182
00:08:36,335 --> 00:08:38,229
Your best years are gone,
and they weren't so good.

183
00:08:38,424 --> 00:08:39,916
I don't hate my life, Reese.

184
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:41,163
What about the stuff I've done to you,

185
00:08:41,885 --> 00:08:43,166
like when I baked your shoes,

186
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:44,575
or broke your wedding china,

187
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:47,557
or when I sold those tickets to those
fifth graders to watch you shower?

188
00:08:47,594 --> 00:08:48,767
You did what?!

189
00:08:48,809 --> 00:08:51,024
Perfect! Now direct
that anger to the bike!

190
00:09:07,052 --> 00:09:09,152
Don't let me fall!

191
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:11,209
Okay, I think we've
made a lot of progress!

192
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:12,677
That's enough for today!

193
00:09:15,216 --> 00:09:17,054
So, lately, I've been going
to the library with Mom.

194
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:19,132
That's all. I don't want
anyone following us.

195
00:09:20,024 --> 00:09:22,130
Like I said, it's just the
library, where we do...

196
00:09:23,693 --> 00:09:24,558
library things.

197
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:28,291
Has anyone seen our bicycle pump?

198
00:09:32,097 --> 00:09:33,848
<i>Hal's in. Your bet.</i>

199
00:09:34,179 --> 00:09:35,634
Five dollars?

200
00:09:36,082 --> 00:09:37,389
-<i>I'll call.</i>
-Hi, guys.

201
00:09:37,748 --> 00:09:39,859
-Where should I put this?
-I'll take care of it.

202
00:09:41,262 --> 00:09:42,161
-Thanks.
-Uh-huh.

203
00:09:46,616 --> 00:09:48,099
This is about the
dental visit, isn't it?

204
00:09:48,116 --> 00:09:50,190
You know, I don't
recall a dental visit.

205
00:09:50,192 --> 00:09:51,844
I recall a mugging!

206
00:09:51,845 --> 00:09:54,978
I'm surprised you'd bring it up,
considering you ran out on the bill.

207
00:09:55,042 --> 00:09:56,268
-Con artist!
-Welsher!

208
00:09:56,276 --> 00:09:57,956
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
What's this about?

209
00:09:58,032 --> 00:10:01,268
I went to Trey to get my tooth
fixed for free like he promised,

210
00:10:01,413 --> 00:10:05,363
and then this pirate
hands me a bill for $2,000!

211
00:10:05,372 --> 00:10:07,501
Free?! I never said
I'd fix it for free!

212
00:10:07,513 --> 00:10:10,636
-You said you'd take care of it!
-And I took care of it!

213
00:10:10,733 --> 00:10:11,738
I fixed it!

214
00:10:11,906 --> 00:10:15,807
Now Hal is walking around here
pain-free with a stolen smile!

215
00:10:15,862 --> 00:10:16,772
How dare you?!

216
00:10:16,946 --> 00:10:18,935
We were all here. Now, who's right?

217
00:10:19,011 --> 00:10:20,761
I think the answer is pretty clear.

218
00:10:21,263 --> 00:10:21,984
-Hal!
-Trey!

219
00:10:23,158 --> 00:10:24,347
What are you talking about?

220
00:10:24,648 --> 00:10:26,168
The man said he'd take care of it.

221
00:10:26,335 --> 00:10:27,843
Everyone knows what that means.

222
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:30,077
Yeah, it means he'd fix it for free.

223
00:10:30,179 --> 00:10:30,717
Thank you!

224
00:10:30,828 --> 00:10:35,117
You're just saying that because it
was your cheap-ass caramel corn
that broke his tooth in the first place.

225
00:10:35,123 --> 00:10:36,851
It had nothing to do
with the caramel corn!

226
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:39,883
Guys, guys, guys,
this is ruining the game.

227
00:10:40,091 --> 00:10:42,454
Malik, you do mediation
at your law firm.

228
00:10:42,479 --> 00:10:44,176
-Can't you help out?
-Fine.

229
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:48,127
Fellas, I want you both to just sit
down and listen to each other.

230
00:10:50,236 --> 00:10:55,404
Trey, can't you see where "I'll take
care of it" could be misinterpreted?

231
00:10:56,107 --> 00:10:58,220
-Well, I suppose it could.
-Yeah!

232
00:10:59,098 --> 00:11:03,043
And, Hal, can't you see
that Trey is a professional?

233
00:11:03,419 --> 00:11:05,630
He went to years of medical school.

234
00:11:05,633 --> 00:11:07,526
And then he gave up
and became a dentist.

235
00:11:11,635 --> 00:11:13,893
Trey deserves to be
compensated for his work.

236
00:11:14,402 --> 00:11:16,498
It's natural and it's fair.

237
00:11:17,703 --> 00:11:18,619
I guess it is.

238
00:11:21,206 --> 00:11:22,566
I'm sorry, Trey.

239
00:11:22,978 --> 00:11:24,093
No offense taken.

240
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:30,759
So, Malik, how much do we owe you?

241
00:11:30,785 --> 00:11:32,041
Ah, nothing. We're friends.

242
00:11:32,044 --> 00:11:33,743
A-ha! You see?

243
00:11:33,744 --> 00:11:34,980
It's not the same!

244
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:37,364
You came to me as a professional.

245
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:38,930
You get a salary for your work.

246
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:42,175
Imagine going to somebody's house,
playing Tetris, shuffling papers

247
00:11:42,178 --> 00:11:45,608
and making long- distance
calls, and nobody paid you?!

248
00:11:45,614 --> 00:11:46,410
That's it!

249
00:11:46,609 --> 00:11:49,893
I don't want your repo thugs
coming after me, so here!

250
00:12:01,414 --> 00:12:05,854
So, Peterson puts the report
on my desk and says, uh...

251
00:12:14,673 --> 00:12:16,807
Hal, if your tooth hurts, don't eat.

252
00:12:16,877 --> 00:12:17,351
I'm fine.

253
00:12:21,878 --> 00:12:23,754
-Hal, just stop it.
-Stop what?

254
00:12:23,866 --> 00:12:25,397
We're all afraid you're
going to choke to death.

255
00:12:26,028 --> 00:12:29,038
-You can't eat if you don't chew.
-I don't need to chew.

256
00:12:29,744 --> 00:12:31,000
I am fine.

257
00:12:31,565 --> 00:12:34,037
The key is relaxing
the esophagus.

258
00:12:34,287 --> 00:12:35,708
Jamie, I hope you're
paying attention.

259
00:12:46,851 --> 00:12:48,656
So, Mom, how's the
bike-a-thon going?

260
00:12:50,835 --> 00:12:51,451
Just great.

261
00:12:52,032 --> 00:12:53,811
-I'm really excited about it.
-You are, huh?

262
00:12:54,552 --> 00:12:55,515
How long have you been riding?

263
00:12:56,493 --> 00:12:57,005
Long enough.

264
00:12:57,702 --> 00:12:58,622
Fascinating!

265
00:13:00,224 --> 00:13:01,483
Hey, you know what I could go for?

266
00:13:02,005 --> 00:13:03,117
Another piece of cake.

267
00:13:03,637 --> 00:13:04,334
There is no more.

268
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:06,355
-What about that piece?
-My piece?

269
00:13:07,089 --> 00:13:08,872
That's okay. I don't need
another piece of cake.

270
00:13:09,295 --> 00:13:10,495
I can just continue talking.

271
00:13:10,931 --> 00:13:12,151
So, what was I talking about?

272
00:13:12,676 --> 00:13:14,559
Oh, yeah, your bike riding.

273
00:13:17,681 --> 00:13:19,236
These chairs are so uncomfortable.

274
00:13:19,354 --> 00:13:21,843
They have no idea how
to conform to our bodies.

275
00:13:29,776 --> 00:13:32,690
Hal, you have an infection.
You have to see a dentist.

276
00:13:32,703 --> 00:13:35,159
I made an appointment with
Dr. Voorhees tomorrow.

277
00:13:35,408 --> 00:13:37,240
Isn't that the guy we
took Dewey's hamster to?

278
00:13:37,245 --> 00:13:38,535
He's a doctor.

279
00:13:38,849 --> 00:13:41,904
If he isn't in the society pages, then
you're not impressed, huh, Lois?

280
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:44,176
Go back to Trey!

281
00:13:44,189 --> 00:13:46,113
-We'll find the money somehow.
-No way!

282
00:13:46,188 --> 00:13:48,393
Well, you are going to have to
find some way to deal with this.

283
00:13:48,445 --> 00:13:50,375
I know and I have.

284
00:13:50,422 --> 00:13:52,105
I'm not an idiot, Lois.

285
00:13:52,163 --> 00:13:54,098
Now, please, will you
hand me my scream box?

286
00:14:05,157 --> 00:14:06,965
Hey, what's all the noise?

287
00:14:07,112 --> 00:14:07,942
You know the rule.

288
00:14:08,132 --> 00:14:10,222
The only sound allowed
in this room is snoring.

289
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:12,911
I've been waiting ten years to
see Conrad Horner perform,

290
00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:15,356
and I overslept and
completely missed it.

291
00:14:15,387 --> 00:14:17,358
Oh, he'll come back in a few years.

292
00:14:17,516 --> 00:14:18,731
He's 98.

293
00:14:19,018 --> 00:14:22,543
I got there in time to get a program off the
floor and see his ambulance drive away.

294
00:14:22,554 --> 00:14:23,046
Oh, well.

295
00:14:24,206 --> 00:14:25,173
You know what would help?

296
00:14:26,055 --> 00:14:26,712
Sleep.

297
00:14:27,698 --> 00:14:30,140
I actually dreamed
I was in this bed sleeping.

298
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:31,772
Sleep is all we ever do anymore.

299
00:14:32,249 --> 00:14:33,605
Do you even know what day it is?

300
00:14:34,236 --> 00:14:35,897
I don't even know what year it is.

301
00:14:36,154 --> 00:14:36,916
Get up!

302
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,339
Don't you have a test tomorrow?

303
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:40,906
It could affect college, your future!

304
00:14:40,936 --> 00:14:44,409
I'm pursuing my dreams right
here in a much more direct way.

305
00:14:45,366 --> 00:14:46,358
Well, I'm done with it.

306
00:14:46,633 --> 00:14:48,411
Fine! More room for me.

307
00:14:49,293 --> 00:14:50,246
So that's your plan?

308
00:14:50,646 --> 00:14:52,467
You're going to sleep
for the rest of your life?

309
00:14:53,123 --> 00:14:54,116
That's pretty pathetic.

310
00:14:54,172 --> 00:14:55,074
I'll leave my mark.

311
00:14:55,343 --> 00:15:00,846
Long after I'm gone, the memory
coils in this bed will still remember
the contours of my body.

312
00:15:00,853 --> 00:15:02,602
Listen to yourself. That's insane.

313
00:15:02,848 --> 00:15:03,999
This bed is evil.

314
00:15:04,126 --> 00:15:05,899
It's draining your soul, Malcolm!

315
00:15:10,292 --> 00:15:10,764
Malcolm?

316
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:15,249
Okay, Mom, I think today we might break
the 12-inch distance record we set yesterday.

317
00:15:15,464 --> 00:15:16,920
It's white-knuckle time.

318
00:15:17,369 --> 00:15:19,388
I'm not doing this anymore.

319
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:22,103
-What?!
-You know I can't do it.

320
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:24,842
I just cannot get on that
bike again. It's just too hard.

321
00:15:26,832 --> 00:15:28,485
Oh, it's too hard?

322
00:15:29,141 --> 00:15:31,542
Well, why didn't you say so?

323
00:15:31,802 --> 00:15:34,902
When things get tough, you got to just
give up and run away from your dreams.

324
00:15:35,016 --> 00:15:36,345
Lower your expectations.

325
00:15:36,381 --> 00:15:37,901
That's fine. I've had my fun.

326
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:40,378
If you want to quit, go ahead and quit.

327
00:15:40,379 --> 00:15:42,909
All right, Reese, you made
your point. Let's give it a try.

328
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:45,910
No, I was really saying quit.

329
00:15:47,776 --> 00:15:51,626
I want to thank Hal for inviting us
all over for a special afternoon game.

330
00:15:52,195 --> 00:15:54,466
I don't want to be the one
to break up the game here.

331
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:57,593
-I have nothing to be ashamed of.
-If you're implying...

332
00:15:57,597 --> 00:16:00,723
Gentlemen, gentlemen,
no one is implying anything.

333
00:16:00,995 --> 00:16:03,438
All I'm saying is it's hard
keeping the game together.

334
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:09,143
And despite our differences, I think
we can all agree this is nothing like
the hidden jack incident of '91.

335
00:16:09,147 --> 00:16:11,324
-Here we go.
-You are damn right. Here we go.

336
00:16:11,485 --> 00:16:14,657
Don't throw around accusations.
I will not be accused of cheating.

337
00:16:14,662 --> 00:16:15,991
I never said you were cheating.

338
00:16:15,992 --> 00:16:18,601
I said it looked like you were
cheating. That's totally different.

339
00:16:18,604 --> 00:16:19,852
I don't need to cheat.

340
00:16:19,989 --> 00:16:21,656
You're not that good a poker player.

341
00:16:21,672 --> 00:16:25,304
So the card I needed to make my straight
just decided on its own to leave the table?

342
00:16:25,311 --> 00:16:26,744
Guys, guys, come on.

343
00:16:26,952 --> 00:16:28,881
I'm just saying we made it through that,

344
00:16:28,941 --> 00:16:30,040
we can make it through this.

345
00:16:30,542 --> 00:16:32,632
I have a feeling by
the end of this game,

346
00:16:32,721 --> 00:16:34,193
the problem will be solved.

347
00:16:35,258 --> 00:16:35,819
Show 'em.

348
00:16:36,778 --> 00:16:37,715
Pair of twos.

349
00:16:38,264 --> 00:16:38,816
Beats me.

350
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:39,895
Me, too.

351
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:41,303
Pair of two's the winner.

352
00:16:41,651 --> 00:16:43,765
Wow, I win again?

353
00:16:44,413 --> 00:16:47,820
Oh, I must be on a real lucky streak.
I must have a thousand dollars here.

354
00:16:49,886 --> 00:16:50,590
Wait a minute.

355
00:16:53,434 --> 00:16:54,613
Dead hand. Cards over.

356
00:16:57,151 --> 00:16:58,903
You had a flush! Look!

357
00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:00,982
You're letting me win!

358
00:17:01,246 --> 00:17:01,794
You are?!

359
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:03,872
We're just trying to
get this thing settled.

360
00:17:03,876 --> 00:17:06,344
I don't want your
money if I didn't win it.

361
00:17:06,947 --> 00:17:09,276
I have no need for your pity!

362
00:17:09,299 --> 00:17:10,614
I can't stand it anymore!

363
00:17:10,736 --> 00:17:13,093
I'll give you the dental
work for free. Happy?

364
00:17:13,235 --> 00:17:16,384
Let's go right down to my office
right now and put back that crown.

365
00:17:16,409 --> 00:17:17,430
-It's settled.
-No!

366
00:17:17,821 --> 00:17:19,544
I am not some charity case,

367
00:17:19,596 --> 00:17:22,579
and I am not going to relieve
you of your conscience, either.

368
00:17:22,584 --> 00:17:23,656
-Hal!
-No!

369
00:17:24,018 --> 00:17:27,458
You will be the one to have
to live with the pain, not me!

370
00:17:28,259 --> 00:17:29,811
Give me that glass of ice water!

371
00:17:29,976 --> 00:17:31,493
-No!
-No!

372
00:17:32,684 --> 00:17:34,416
I hope you're happy!

373
00:17:34,611 --> 00:17:35,841
<i>Hal, Stop! Think about it.</i>

374
00:17:39,986 --> 00:17:42,208
-Hal! Hal!
-Hal! Come on, Hal!

375
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,163
My back's killing me.

376
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:48,638
What happened?

377
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:51,481
Malcolm, you're awake.

378
00:17:52,109 --> 00:17:53,601
We were worried
about you for a while.

379
00:17:54,081 --> 00:17:55,381
What happened to
the new mattress?

380
00:17:56,015 --> 00:17:58,172
-What are you talking about?
-The mattress!

381
00:17:59,426 --> 00:18:00,841
I know there was a mattress.

382
00:18:01,563 --> 00:18:02,376
Maybe it was a dream.

383
00:18:02,542 --> 00:18:03,721
It wasn't a dream!

384
00:18:04,002 --> 00:18:07,090
The mattress was perfect and
white, and it felt like a cloud!

385
00:18:07,456 --> 00:18:09,682
It fell out of the sky,
and it made me happy!

386
00:18:10,655 --> 00:18:13,556
Was it just a bed, or was
there a beanstalk, too?

387
00:18:18,946 --> 00:18:20,037
Maybe it was a dream.

388
00:18:21,282 --> 00:18:22,483
You were happy, Malcolm.

389
00:18:23,052 --> 00:18:24,061
Of course it was a dream.

390
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,613
Okay, Mom, this is it.

391
00:18:30,965 --> 00:18:32,817
Once you're up, don't look down.

392
00:18:32,822 --> 00:18:33,911
-But...
-Trust me.

393
00:18:34,182 --> 00:18:35,232
Just start pedaling.

394
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:37,232
I'm going to make sure
you get through this.

395
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:38,559
You are not alone.

396
00:18:39,596 --> 00:18:41,044
-Thank you, Reese.
-Now go!

397
00:19:01,229 --> 00:19:02,283
Oh, my God!

398
00:19:02,612 --> 00:19:03,565
I'm doing it!

399
00:19:05,037 --> 00:19:06,565
I'm riding!

400
00:19:08,373 --> 00:19:10,986
<i>Don't worry, Mom!
It's for your own good.</i>

401
00:19:11,712 --> 00:19:12,700
Reese?!

402
00:19:13,116 --> 00:19:16,288
Try to go slow, Mom!
I'm going to crash into you!

403
00:19:16,439 --> 00:19:19,395
I'm going to prove to you
that falling isn't so bad!

404
00:19:19,613 --> 00:19:22,585
No, Reese, I'm doing fine, see?

405
00:19:22,634 --> 00:19:24,696
Mom, it's the only way!

406
00:19:45,973 --> 00:19:47,224
Reese, it worked!

407
00:19:47,405 --> 00:19:48,525
I'm not afraid.

408
00:19:49,998 --> 00:19:51,028
I can ride.

409
00:19:51,289 --> 00:19:52,379
Thank you.

410
00:19:53,756 --> 00:19:54,831
Mommy...

411
00:20:07,671 --> 00:20:09,547
Help me! Help me!

412
00:20:10,055 --> 00:20:10,759
So...

413
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:13,176
Want to tell me what's going on here?

414
00:20:13,445 --> 00:20:14,396
It's cool, Officer.

415
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:17,185
You see, we tied him up because
he's got a painful, busted tooth,

416
00:20:17,423 --> 00:20:18,809
and he refused to let us fix it.

417
00:20:25,419 --> 00:20:26,562
Help! Help me!

418
00:20:27,247 --> 00:20:28,067
<i>I need help!</i>

419
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,406
Okay. Drive safe.

420
00:20:31,176 --> 00:20:31,746
Thank you, sir.

421
00:20:32,793 --> 00:20:34,298
Help! Help me!

422
00:20:34,904 --> 00:20:35,783
Help me!

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
