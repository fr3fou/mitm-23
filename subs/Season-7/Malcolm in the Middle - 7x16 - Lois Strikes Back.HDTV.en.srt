1
00:00:03,666 --> 00:00:06,135
Reese, I just bought that
for you. Will you look at...

2
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:08,003
Give it to me.

3
00:00:08,065 --> 00:00:09,064
Let me see what I can do with it.

4
00:00:11,005 --> 00:00:13,030
I sneezed in chem lab
and spilled acid on it.

5
00:00:16,168 --> 00:00:18,463
I'm not wearing these
stupid shorts anymore.

6
00:00:18,645 --> 00:00:20,131
Everyone's making fun of me.

7
00:00:25,309 --> 00:00:26,845
<i>A denim tie.</i>

8
00:00:26,904 --> 00:00:28,783
How cool is that?

12
00:01:05,034 --> 00:01:05,922
No way!

13
00:01:06,186 --> 00:01:07,377
No way! That's awesome.

14
00:01:08,005 --> 00:01:09,408
Okay. I can't wait to see you.

15
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:11,938
No, I can't wait to see you more.

16
00:01:12,814 --> 00:01:14,647
No, I can't wait to see you more.

17
00:01:15,716 --> 00:01:16,526
Okay, you win.

18
00:01:17,042 --> 00:01:20,157
All right, Cindy's only a few blocks
away, so everybody calm down.

19
00:01:20,958 --> 00:01:23,723
When she gets here, just try to be cool.
I want to make a good impression.

20
00:01:24,766 --> 00:01:25,738
Do I have a bat in the hanger?

21
00:01:25,868 --> 00:01:28,004
You've asked me five times.
The answer's still yes.

22
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:30,339
So, this is pretty exciting, Reese.

23
00:01:30,466 --> 00:01:31,503
When did you meet this girl?

24
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:32,474
I haven't actually met her.

25
00:01:32,709 --> 00:01:33,989
Her cousin goes to school with me,

26
00:01:34,149 --> 00:01:36,314
and Cindy saw me at the dance
last week and thought I was hot.

27
00:01:36,327 --> 00:01:37,538
Oh, well, I don't blame her.

28
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,603
I mean, forgetting I'm
your mother for a minute,

29
00:01:39,608 --> 00:01:44,449
if I saw you walking down the street,
I would think, there is one hot guy.

30
00:01:45,127 --> 00:01:45,917
Yeesh.

31
00:01:46,059 --> 00:01:48,525
Cindy and I talked on the phone
almost every night last week,

32
00:01:48,706 --> 00:01:50,357
and we totally have the
same sense of humor.

33
00:01:50,391 --> 00:01:53,419
She said she saw me put the plastic dog
poop in the punch bowl at the school dance,

34
00:01:53,751 --> 00:01:55,993
and we both agreed that the real
stuff would have been funnier.

35
00:01:56,669 --> 00:01:59,202
You put plastic poop in the punch bowl?!

36
00:01:59,384 --> 00:02:01,296
Once again, you completely miss the point.

37
00:02:02,919 --> 00:02:04,825
So, what kind of loser would
want to go out with you?

38
00:02:06,737 --> 00:02:07,947
<i>This kind of loser.</i>

39
00:02:09,246 --> 00:02:12,653
And if she kisses half as good as her
picture does, this is going to be sweet.

40
00:02:13,483 --> 00:02:15,132
Okay, there she is.
Everybody, get out of here.

41
00:02:15,687 --> 00:02:16,132
No, wait.

42
00:02:16,241 --> 00:02:17,436
She'll probably want to meet you.

43
00:02:17,944 --> 00:02:19,723
Okay, you can stay, just
don't say anything stupid.

44
00:02:21,204 --> 00:02:21,797
How's my hair?

45
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,012
Can you smell my pits?

46
00:02:23,731 --> 00:02:25,264
Why'd you let me put
on this stupid shirt?

47
00:02:25,304 --> 00:02:28,246
Reese, relax. All you have
to do is just be yourself.

48
00:02:29,534 --> 00:02:30,286
You're right, Mom.

49
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:32,045
Thanks.

50
00:02:44,546 --> 00:02:45,771
Enjoy your date, Reese!

51
00:02:52,946 --> 00:02:55,411
And the pig was actually
wearing lipstick?

52
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:57,493
Reese was devastated.

53
00:02:57,702 --> 00:02:58,492
I can just imagine.

54
00:02:58,492 --> 00:03:00,023
And-And I don't like it.

55
00:03:00,249 --> 00:03:01,870
No, no, no, not one little bit.

56
00:03:02,522 --> 00:03:05,146
Now, uh, what is it that
you want me to do?

57
00:03:05,864 --> 00:03:08,259
Look, I know that Reese has
not been a model student,

58
00:03:08,401 --> 00:03:10,816
and once again, I want to
apologize for your tires.

59
00:03:11,297 --> 00:03:12,066
And your mailbox.

60
00:03:12,296 --> 00:03:13,365
And your lawn fountain.

61
00:03:13,517 --> 00:03:17,106
But what those girls did is just cruel,
and I need to see them punished.

62
00:03:17,122 --> 00:03:18,873
All right, you let me see
what I can find out.

63
00:03:19,454 --> 00:03:21,376
Now, these girls are
obviously quite clever.

64
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,741
I mean, where do you
even... find a pig?

65
00:03:24,742 --> 00:03:27,536
And then we have to get it over to
your house, and put makeup on it.

66
00:03:28,747 --> 00:03:31,290
Reese was completely blindsided, huh?

67
00:03:31,524 --> 00:03:32,156
You know what?

68
00:03:32,674 --> 00:03:33,561
I have had it.

69
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:37,747
How would you like it if I called the
Superintendent and told him all about this?

70
00:03:37,772 --> 00:03:39,597
Great. I'll put him
on the speaker phone.

71
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,940
REESE & CINDY
For King and Queen

72
00:04:03,123 --> 00:04:04,242
<i>Unbelievable.</i>

73
00:04:04,652 --> 00:04:07,527
I've never witnessed anything
like that in my entire life.

74
00:04:07,659 --> 00:04:08,852
There's no excuse for it.

75
00:04:08,858 --> 00:04:12,435
How did an immature jerk like that get to
be Principal of a high school, Hal? How?

76
00:04:12,779 --> 00:04:14,471
-Well, with what they...
-He actually laughed.

77
00:04:14,542 --> 00:04:18,244
He couldn't care less that our
son is curled up on his bed and
completely devastated by this.

78
00:04:21,547 --> 00:04:24,699
Honey, I think you actually got
chunks of cutting board in the salad.

79
00:04:27,023 --> 00:04:29,989
-Well, I happen to be very upset, Hal.
-I'm upset, too. And this...

80
00:04:30,355 --> 00:04:32,631
Principal sounds like a real idiot, but,

81
00:04:33,345 --> 00:04:37,824
you've talked to him, and if he's
not going to do anything about it,
I don't see what else we can do.

82
00:04:37,854 --> 00:04:38,885
Well, you know what, Hal?

83
00:04:39,251 --> 00:04:40,602
That's just unacceptable to me.

84
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:41,927
It's just the way it is.

85
00:04:42,353 --> 00:04:44,244
Kids do cruel things to each other.

86
00:04:44,781 --> 00:04:46,745
But, you know, they bounce
back when you're young.

87
00:04:47,188 --> 00:04:49,732
And I actually think that Reese
is coming around a little bit.

88
00:04:54,559 --> 00:04:57,743
Well, I brought him soup yesterday,
and he couldn't even make a sound.

89
00:04:58,626 --> 00:04:59,302
Now, I really...

90
00:04:59,695 --> 00:05:02,126
I really think thing's are
going to turn out okay.

91
00:05:04,329 --> 00:05:08,265
Are you trying to calm me down?

92
00:05:10,448 --> 00:05:11,085
No.

93
00:05:12,735 --> 00:05:17,103
I just don't think it leads anywhere
good when you get like this.

94
00:05:18,669 --> 00:05:19,363
Get like what?

95
00:05:21,069 --> 00:05:21,416
Well...

96
00:05:22,982 --> 00:05:23,336
you know.

97
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:24,778
No, I don't know.

98
00:05:26,149 --> 00:05:27,094
How is it I get?

99
00:05:29,637 --> 00:05:30,081
Well...

100
00:05:30,266 --> 00:05:31,597
If I have a problem,

101
00:05:33,414 --> 00:05:36,439
I would love for you
to explain it to me.

102
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,610
You know what, honey? This seems
like a-a longer conversation,

103
00:05:45,612 --> 00:05:48,899
and it just so happens that I am right
in the middle of a project in the garage.

104
00:05:49,153 --> 00:05:52,398
I'm fixing that drawer
from our bathroom cabinet.

105
00:05:52,716 --> 00:05:56,403
You know how you've always
had to keep your makeup brushes
in the pockets of your robe?

106
00:05:56,405 --> 00:05:58,490
Well, I finally got around to
it, and wouldn't you know,

107
00:05:58,696 --> 00:06:00,220
it's time for that second gluing.

108
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,864
<i>But if you let it dry too much,</i>

109
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:04,364
you might as well make
a bird's nest out of it.

110
00:06:04,537 --> 00:06:08,077
But then I'd have to sand it and paint it,
and that's a whole different magilla.

111
00:06:08,413 --> 00:06:12,540
But when I'm done, we will roll up our
sleeves, and we will get through this.

112
00:06:12,549 --> 00:06:14,822
I mean, if you have to vent, go ahead.

113
00:06:14,891 --> 00:06:16,937
I am your sounding board.

114
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:20,089
I don't care if you have
to bite my head off.

115
00:06:20,111 --> 00:06:22,887
It's okay, it's what I'm here for.

116
00:06:23,218 --> 00:06:24,856
I am your rock.

117
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:28,728
You've always been there for
me, and I'll be there for you,

118
00:06:29,054 --> 00:06:32,825
even though physically, I may be in
the garage, and you in the kitchen.

119
00:06:32,998 --> 00:06:35,742
No matter where I am, I'm there.

120
00:06:38,581 --> 00:06:39,687
I want names.

121
00:06:40,113 --> 00:06:40,919
How many were there?

122
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,441
Good. At least you can hear me now.

123
00:06:46,134 --> 00:06:47,943
Just nod when you see one.

124
00:06:54,684 --> 00:06:55,182
Kristin?

125
00:06:55,555 --> 00:06:56,132
<i>It's okay.</i>

126
00:06:56,963 --> 00:06:58,294
She can't hurt you now.

127
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:17,904
You just love that beautiful hair.

128
00:07:19,073 --> 00:07:19,881
Don't you, sweetie?

129
00:07:30,974 --> 00:07:32,286
Damn this drawer!

130
00:07:32,595 --> 00:07:33,675
What do you want from me?!

131
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:57,194
And you can kiss that baby good-bye.

132
00:07:57,219 --> 00:08:00,744
Another walk off home run for
Hal, and the crowd is on its feet.

133
00:08:02,505 --> 00:08:03,614
Hal! Hal!

134
00:08:21,784 --> 00:08:23,446
I can't take this anymore, Reese.

135
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:25,774
You have to stop this
and get on with your life.

136
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:29,990
Did I remind you of your life?

137
00:08:39,525 --> 00:08:40,167
Look, Reese.

138
00:08:40,347 --> 00:08:43,072
It's my ant farm. I've been
raising them for months.

139
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:45,935
I know all their names and love
each and every one of them.

140
00:08:46,525 --> 00:08:47,728
<i>Here, have fun.</i>

141
00:08:48,465 --> 00:08:50,777
Why does everything I love
always turn into a pig?

142
00:08:57,285 --> 00:08:58,106
Hey, I've got it.

143
00:08:58,517 --> 00:08:59,205
You'll love this.

144
00:08:59,644 --> 00:09:02,167
Today at lunch,
Rick Jensen sat in beef stew.

145
00:09:02,434 --> 00:09:04,230
And then spilled lemonade on his crotch.

146
00:09:04,422 --> 00:09:05,721
It was a perfect storm.

147
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:08,246
Kids were coming from
other schools to laugh at him.

148
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,068
Was he able to get his pants clean?

149
00:09:16,215 --> 00:09:17,304
Come on, Reese.

150
00:09:18,022 --> 00:09:19,180
You should get back to bed.

151
00:09:20,027 --> 00:09:22,037
I'll bet his mom wasn't
able to get his pants clean.

152
00:09:24,608 --> 00:09:25,793
Hi, Malcolm.
How was school?

153
00:09:26,438 --> 00:09:27,337
Okay, I guess.

154
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:31,015
Well, there was this
one weird thing.

155
00:09:32,424 --> 00:09:35,495
<i>This girl named Kristin, she's one
of the girls that picked on Reese.</i>

156
00:09:35,699 --> 00:09:37,137
<i>You're not going to believe
what happened to her.</i>

157
00:09:39,736 --> 00:09:40,182
Oh, my God!

158
00:09:41,124 --> 00:09:42,578
Oh, my God! Oh!

159
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:44,696
My hair! Oh, my God.

160
00:09:45,866 --> 00:09:46,822
Oh, my God!

161
00:09:47,082 --> 00:09:47,747
Who did this?!

162
00:09:48,109 --> 00:09:49,217
Who did this?!

163
00:09:49,749 --> 00:09:53,952
They tried to get it all out, but I heard
the janitor ended up having to cut off
all her hair with a hedge trimmer.

164
00:09:53,955 --> 00:09:54,759
Really?

165
00:09:57,893 --> 00:09:58,679
That's terrible.

166
00:09:59,479 --> 00:10:00,985
People can be so cruel.

167
00:10:06,193 --> 00:10:07,280
<i>Oh, absolutely.</i>

168
00:10:08,952 --> 00:10:10,504
Ugh! I know, exactly.

169
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,955
You know, Kristin could
not stop sobbing.

170
00:10:13,064 --> 00:10:14,791
I'm even earing now,
she's a complete wreck.

171
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:17,713
I know. Did you see
her without her hair?

172
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,041
<i>You know, I never realized
she had such a tiny head.</i>

173
00:10:21,522 --> 00:10:22,873
<i>Oh, but you know what
the best part is?</i>

174
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:24,087
Now Dylan's available.

175
00:10:25,254 --> 00:10:25,788
<i>Does he?</i>

176
00:10:26,581 --> 00:10:27,671
<i>No. Get out!</i>

177
00:10:34,966 --> 00:10:35,730
Okay, rookie...

178
00:10:36,109 --> 00:10:37,206
Show me what you got.

179
00:10:45,539 --> 00:10:46,115
Okay...

180
00:10:46,827 --> 00:10:48,657
At least we know
you're not on steroids.

181
00:10:58,052 --> 00:10:59,226
Mom, what are you doing here?

182
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:01,067
I'm here to pick up
some things for Reese.

183
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:03,545
You know, so he can catch
up on his school work.

184
00:11:03,641 --> 00:11:04,716
I hope you rented a truck.

185
00:11:04,718 --> 00:11:05,217
You know what?

186
00:11:05,771 --> 00:11:08,198
Everyone seems very amused
by your brother's pain.

187
00:11:08,507 --> 00:11:10,260
Well, I think people
better start thinking twice.

188
00:11:16,366 --> 00:11:17,197
Oh, my God!

189
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,006
<i>Who did this?</i>

190
00:11:24,177 --> 00:11:24,928
<i>Moppet?!</i>

191
00:11:25,543 --> 00:11:26,266
Baby?!

192
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,461
No!

193
00:11:35,365 --> 00:11:36,129
It's you!

194
00:11:42,586 --> 00:11:43,236
There you are.

195
00:11:44,761 --> 00:11:48,143
You took off so fast from school,
we didn't get a chance to talk
about what happened to Diane.

196
00:11:48,201 --> 00:11:49,672
I'm a very busy woman, Malcolm.

197
00:11:49,686 --> 00:11:51,339
It isn't easy running this household.

198
00:11:51,388 --> 00:11:55,816
I can imagine... cooking, shopping,
cutting the heads off of dolls.

199
00:11:55,955 --> 00:11:57,010
I have no idea what you're talking about.

200
00:11:57,425 --> 00:12:01,367
Come on, Mom, it's pretty obvious
what's going on here, and I think it's sick!

201
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,842
Did you see Diane's reaction?

202
00:12:02,857 --> 00:12:03,581
No, I didn't...

203
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:04,771
Was she crying?

204
00:12:04,809 --> 00:12:08,081
She had to be wrapped in a blanket
and carried to the school nurse's office.

205
00:12:08,138 --> 00:12:09,605
Terrible, just terrible.

206
00:12:10,288 --> 00:12:13,915
There's a salad in the fridge
and you boys can make yourselves
sloppy Joe's whenever you're hungry.

207
00:12:14,296 --> 00:12:15,320
I've got some errands to run.

208
00:12:15,465 --> 00:12:16,739
Oh, "errands," right?

209
00:12:16,884 --> 00:12:17,976
I know what you're up to, Mom.

210
00:12:17,991 --> 00:12:19,505
Oh, yes, Malcolm, you've caught me.

211
00:12:19,773 --> 00:12:23,716
I've got to return an overdue video,
go to the cleaners, and pick up
milk and cereal for the morning.

212
00:12:23,723 --> 00:12:24,652
Guilty as charged.

213
00:12:24,653 --> 00:12:25,723
<i>Oh, nice try.</i>

214
00:12:25,872 --> 00:12:27,375
Now, I want you to look
me in the eye and...

215
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:31,500
Mom, I know you're behind all
this, and sooner or later you're
going to have to talk to me.

216
00:12:31,671 --> 00:12:34,084
<i>For God's sake, Malcolm,
can't I have a moment's rest?</i>

217
00:12:34,152 --> 00:12:35,254
No, you can't!

218
00:12:35,434 --> 00:12:38,617
Tell me, did it feel good to
cut through Elmo's neck?

219
00:12:38,767 --> 00:12:39,331
Did it?!

220
00:12:39,921 --> 00:12:40,340
Mom?

221
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:42,324
Mom?

222
00:12:47,814 --> 00:12:49,657
Runners on second
and third, with two out.

223
00:12:50,193 --> 00:12:52,044
Here's the wind-up, and the pitch.

224
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:57,108
You know, it's a shame to see some of
these veterans hang on a little too long.

225
00:12:57,307 --> 00:12:58,771
Oh, sure, they were great once,

226
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:03,916
but there comes a point when you just
have to say "I'm done," and hang them up.

227
00:13:04,982 --> 00:13:06,492
Dad, you've got to do something.

228
00:13:06,728 --> 00:13:09,919
Mom has been stalking those
girls who humiliated Reese
like some kind of vigilante.

229
00:13:10,188 --> 00:13:11,725
What? Are you sure about this?

230
00:13:11,731 --> 00:13:13,654
Yes. She's nailed two of them so far,

231
00:13:13,771 --> 00:13:16,167
and she just climbed out of the
bathroom window to go get the third.

232
00:13:17,419 --> 00:13:21,318
This sounds like a lot
of supposition, Malcolm.

233
00:13:21,553 --> 00:13:26,437
I mean, it would be a different story if
you had hard evidence or an eyewitness.

234
00:13:27,049 --> 00:13:28,370
I saw her at school today.

235
00:13:28,572 --> 00:13:31,910
She was there when these butchered dolls'
heads rolled out of one of the girls' lockers.

236
00:13:32,486 --> 00:13:35,218
And what exactly do you mean
when you say you were "there"?

237
00:13:35,241 --> 00:13:37,240
Dad, stop it--don't you care?

238
00:13:37,272 --> 00:13:42,581
Of course, I care, But I think what we
need right now is caution and prudence.

239
00:13:42,982 --> 00:13:46,060
A proactive wait-and-see... if you will.

240
00:13:46,087 --> 00:13:47,121
So you're not going to do anything?

241
00:13:47,122 --> 00:13:48,655
Listen, when your mother gets like this,

242
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:51,292
we need to vigilantly keep
abreast of all the developments

243
00:13:51,472 --> 00:13:54,094
in a fully-engaged yet
cautiously-detached...

244
00:13:54,096 --> 00:13:55,658
Oh, forget it... if you're
not going to help me,

245
00:13:55,811 --> 00:13:58,936
then I'll just stop her myself,
and you can stay here and
play your ridiculous little game.

246
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:00,775
Good.

247
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:03,089
Sorry about the delay, folks.

248
00:14:03,421 --> 00:14:04,664
There was a fan on the field.

249
00:14:05,029 --> 00:14:08,698
Now let's see if this bonus baby is really
worth all the money that they paid for him.

250
00:14:15,891 --> 00:14:17,123
My God, that could've killed...

251
00:14:20,225 --> 00:14:23,312
You wouldn't believe the homework Mr.
Hendricks has been dumping on us lately.

252
00:14:23,618 --> 00:14:24,166
Lift your arm.

253
00:14:25,372 --> 00:14:27,111
I mean, okay, your wife moved out.

254
00:14:27,232 --> 00:14:28,426
Don't take it out on us.

255
00:14:28,807 --> 00:14:32,036
If his behavior with her is anything
like it is in math class, I totally get it.

256
00:14:32,552 --> 00:14:34,558
Hey, how is he doing?

257
00:14:35,629 --> 00:14:36,757
He's having a very good day.

258
00:15:07,918 --> 00:15:08,294
Hello?

259
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:08,895
<i>Hello.</i>

260
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:10,568
This is the Edgewood Hotel.

261
00:15:10,626 --> 00:15:14,484
I'm calling to verify a room with
a queen-sized bed for tonight.

262
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:16,427
I'm sorry, there must be some mistake.

263
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:17,163
<i>Oh?</i>

264
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:20,437
The reservation was
made by Heidi Kaczenski.

265
00:15:21,044 --> 00:15:24,560
She also requested a bottle of
champagne and the romance package.

266
00:15:24,706 --> 00:15:26,315
I think you'd better
cancel that reservation.

267
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:29,361
Heidi! Get in here this minute!

268
00:15:30,278 --> 00:15:31,732
Dad, what is so important? I...

269
00:15:31,734 --> 00:15:33,665
You and Scott got a
hotel room for tonight?!

270
00:15:34,236 --> 00:15:34,765
What?!

271
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:35,908
That was the hotel calling.

272
00:15:35,938 --> 00:15:37,178
How could you do this to us?!

273
00:15:37,183 --> 00:15:39,725
I didn't do anything. I was in my
room getting ready for the dance.

274
00:15:39,726 --> 00:15:41,275
You really don't know
anything about this?

275
00:15:41,276 --> 00:15:41,851
No!

276
00:15:42,982 --> 00:15:43,861
What's this?

277
00:15:46,507 --> 00:15:47,255
Oh, my God!

278
00:15:48,425 --> 00:15:49,685
That is not mine!

279
00:15:49,779 --> 00:15:51,312
<i>I don't know what the
hell you were thinking,</i>

280
00:15:51,342 --> 00:15:53,708
but as of right now, you
and Scott are through!

281
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:56,588
I hate you!
I hate both of you!

282
00:16:04,146 --> 00:16:05,236
I saw something move.

283
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:07,395
There's somebody out there.

284
00:16:18,384 --> 00:16:19,267
What's going on out here?

285
00:16:21,929 --> 00:16:23,199
I'll tell you what's going on.

286
00:16:23,271 --> 00:16:25,732
I saw this punk peeking in your window.

287
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,226
What?!

288
00:16:26,316 --> 00:16:27,173
I can't believe this!

289
00:16:27,185 --> 00:16:28,826
Jordan, I thought
you were a good kid!

290
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:29,349
But I was just...

291
00:16:30,129 --> 00:16:32,531
You picked the wrong night to
mess with me, you little perv!

292
00:16:32,635 --> 00:16:34,917
Well, let's see what the police
have to say about this.

293
00:16:48,155 --> 00:16:49,162
I need to talk to you.

294
00:16:50,128 --> 00:16:50,669
Not now.

295
00:16:51,063 --> 00:16:52,904
Please, I need to tell you something.

296
00:16:55,955 --> 00:16:57,286
I've been a terrible mother.

297
00:16:59,798 --> 00:17:00,703
It's okay, Mom.

298
00:17:01,384 --> 00:17:02,538
I've known that for a long time.

299
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:03,770
No, you don't understand.

300
00:17:04,768 --> 00:17:06,724
When those girls humiliated you...

301
00:17:07,676 --> 00:17:10,556
Instead of trying to comfort you and
help you deal with your feelings,

302
00:17:10,572 --> 00:17:14,543
I just got caught up in my own
anger and went on a rampage.

303
00:17:17,237 --> 00:17:17,638
What?

304
00:17:17,921 --> 00:17:21,139
All I was worried about was
making them pay, and they did.

305
00:17:21,526 --> 00:17:23,394
But what disturbs me is...

306
00:17:23,846 --> 00:17:27,532
how much I enjoyed crushing those
three girls and watching them suffer.

307
00:17:28,681 --> 00:17:31,222
I tapped into some dark,
ugly place inside of me.

308
00:17:31,579 --> 00:17:32,420
I was acting like...

309
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:36,383
...you.

310
00:17:38,447 --> 00:17:40,704
Oh, God, who am I kidding?
I wasn't acting like you.

311
00:17:45,646 --> 00:17:46,643
I am you.

312
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:54,791
There's this horrible thing that's
part of us that makes it seem
okay to do really scary stuff.

313
00:17:56,635 --> 00:17:59,558
I must have gotten it from Grandma,
and I passed it on to you, sweetie.

314
00:18:00,147 --> 00:18:01,255
And all I can say is...

315
00:18:03,545 --> 00:18:04,473
I'm sorry.

316
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,452
I'm deeply, deeply sorry.

317
00:18:12,009 --> 00:18:12,888
There's one left?

318
00:18:13,491 --> 00:18:15,438
No, Reese...

319
00:18:18,382 --> 00:18:19,567
That doesn't matter.

320
00:18:19,701 --> 00:18:21,230
Yeah, yeah, I know that, Mom.

321
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,208
I'm just trying to let it sink in.

322
00:18:30,718 --> 00:18:32,227
You know, that girl will
be getting away with it.

323
00:18:32,418 --> 00:18:33,546
She doesn't matter.

324
00:18:34,529 --> 00:18:35,645
What matters is us.

325
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:37,218
I get that stuff about us, Mom.

326
00:18:37,655 --> 00:18:38,512
That was amazing.

327
00:18:39,053 --> 00:18:41,221
I was just thinking about what
must be going through her head.

328
00:18:43,465 --> 00:18:44,859
But you're right, it's not about her.

329
00:18:45,158 --> 00:18:45,920
Exactly.

330
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:52,431
What do you mean what's
going on inside of her head?

331
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:54,857
You know, how she thinks she beat you.

332
00:18:55,336 --> 00:18:58,591
"I'm perfect, and I got away with it,
and that tired, frumpy housewife

333
00:18:58,598 --> 00:19:00,350
just didn't have what it
took to finish the job."

334
00:19:04,172 --> 00:19:06,933
If you think you're
manipulating me, you're wrong.

335
00:19:06,941 --> 00:19:10,442
That girl just needs to know she
can't go around hurting people
without there being consequences.

336
00:19:10,479 --> 00:19:13,062
And that way, she'll grow up
to be a very nice young lady.

337
00:19:13,405 --> 00:19:13,684
Got it.

338
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:17,878
And I want to make it clear that
this is a one time thing, due to
very special circumstances.

339
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,400
Understood.

340
00:19:18,647 --> 00:19:20,602
Now get back there and fill
up those balloons with paint.

341
00:19:21,854 --> 00:19:23,153
And I'll tell you what, Joe.

342
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:26,227
The idea that man came
from an ape still rankles me.

343
00:19:26,237 --> 00:19:27,497
I say prove it.

344
00:19:27,634 --> 00:19:29,183
Point well taken, Skip,

345
00:19:29,216 --> 00:19:34,062
but the good news here at the ballpark
is that the rain delay is finally over, and
we can get back to playing America's...

346
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,588
I think we have enough.

347
00:19:41,011 --> 00:19:41,875
Let's move.

348
00:19:43,311 --> 00:19:44,476
I knew I'd find you here!

349
00:19:44,929 --> 00:19:46,416
Well, congratulations, Columbo.

350
00:19:46,575 --> 00:19:47,735
Now, move, we're in a hurry.

351
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:48,550
Mom, no!

352
00:19:48,675 --> 00:19:50,273
What you're doing is crazy.

353
00:19:50,538 --> 00:19:52,368
It goes against everything
you've ever taught us.

354
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,411
You don't get it, Malcolm.

355
00:19:53,782 --> 00:19:56,691
This is a one time thing, due
to very special circumstances.

356
00:19:56,907 --> 00:19:57,468
Tell him, Mom.

357
00:19:57,475 --> 00:20:00,154
Get out of our way!

358
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,501
This is not going to happen.

359
00:20:07,284 --> 00:20:07,785
They're moving.

360
00:20:07,847 --> 00:20:09,210
-Adjust left.
-Adjusting left.

361
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:15,903
Direct hit.

362
00:20:15,997 --> 00:20:17,591
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

363
00:20:19,817 --> 00:20:20,979
Stop it!

364
00:20:23,652 --> 00:20:25,991
Make them stop!

365
00:20:28,816 --> 00:20:30,859
Let go of me you coward?

366
00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:32,665
Stop it!

367
00:20:36,967 --> 00:20:37,857
This is nice.

368
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:38,606
Just the two of us.

369
00:20:40,433 --> 00:20:41,733
I was just thinking the same thing.

370
00:20:45,576 --> 00:20:47,220
Stop it!

371
00:20:47,927 --> 00:20:49,131
<i>Stop!</i>

372
00:20:49,565 --> 00:20:51,017
It's a shame it was over so quickly.

373
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:51,950
I know.

374
00:20:52,005 --> 00:20:53,935
Maybe we can go bowling
together some time.

375
00:20:54,504 --> 00:20:55,247
I'd like that.

376
00:20:56,277 --> 00:20:57,392
<i>Unbelievable.</i>

377
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:00,286
So as long as you can
rationalize your behavior,

378
00:21:00,468 --> 00:21:01,653
I guess you can do whatever you want.

379
00:21:01,983 --> 00:21:04,166
There are no rules, huh, Mom?
Is that what you're saying?

380
00:21:04,266 --> 00:21:06,870
Oh, Malcolm, for Pete's
sake. Don't be so upset.

381
00:21:07,389 --> 00:21:09,189
I'll do something
with you next week.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
