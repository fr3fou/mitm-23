1
00:00:02,769 --> 00:00:03,448
There you go.

2
00:00:04,422 --> 00:00:05,515
Liver and beans again?

3
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:06,270
<i>It's all we had.</i>

4
00:00:08,369 --> 00:00:09,415
You've done it again, honey.

5
00:00:11,246 --> 00:00:14,622
Jamie, I'm sorry if you don't like it,
but I worked very hard to make this

6
00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:17,176
and nobody leaves until
their plates are clean.

7
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:33,280
Malcolm in the Middle
7.12 - "College Recruiters"

8
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:44,280
Synchronisation par Max & Tyno,
Script original par Raceman.

9
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:55,280
Forom.com, Life-is-Unfair.tk
& Malcolm-France.com

10
00:01:00,496 --> 00:01:01,769
Oh, I'll definitely
call you back.

11
00:01:01,809 --> 00:01:02,718
Hold on. Let me get a pen.

12
00:01:06,155 --> 00:01:06,975
What's the number again?

13
00:01:09,304 --> 00:01:10,172
Great. I got it.

14
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,745
I'll call you, I promise.

15
00:01:12,183 --> 00:01:14,665
If that wasn't a relative,
I'm going to be very upset.

16
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:16,243
It's just another college recruiter.

17
00:01:16,324 --> 00:01:18,399
Just another college recruiter?

18
00:01:18,553 --> 00:01:21,358
You know, when I was applying,
believe me, there were no recruiters.

19
00:01:21,554 --> 00:01:23,828
If I hadn't found that ad
inside that matchbook,

20
00:01:23,832 --> 00:01:26,427
I may not have pursued
higher education at all.

21
00:01:26,632 --> 00:01:27,902
But they're calling me all the time.

22
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:29,594
I must get ten calls a day.

23
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:33,338
Then each one must be handled like
that's the university you're going to.

24
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:34,774
It's called options.

25
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:37,042
Why do you think guys date ugly women?

26
00:01:37,215 --> 00:01:39,381
<i>I swear I will to
kill my mother!</i>

27
00:01:39,889 --> 00:01:44,088
She just slinks down here and marries off
my son to some Eastern European bimbo.

28
00:01:44,329 --> 00:01:45,528
The old reptile.

29
00:01:45,818 --> 00:01:47,598
I can't believe her leg
hasn't grown back.

30
00:01:47,746 --> 00:01:48,707
Honey, calm down.

31
00:01:48,747 --> 00:01:50,501
No. I am going to kill her.

32
00:01:50,864 --> 00:01:53,026
You know, if young person
dies, it looks suspicious.

33
00:01:53,049 --> 00:01:56,507
When old people die, it's just the way
of the world. There's no investigation.

34
00:01:56,513 --> 00:01:58,239
Well, at least Reese
is independent now.

35
00:01:58,352 --> 00:02:01,383
Independent?! He's living in our
garage! How independent is that?

36
00:02:01,604 --> 00:02:04,041
I read about this old woman who
drowned in her bowl of soup.

37
00:02:04,318 --> 00:02:06,330
-It happens.
-Honey, look at the up side.

38
00:02:06,432 --> 00:02:10,913
Malcolm is going off to college, Francis
is with Piama, now Reese is married.

39
00:02:11,361 --> 00:02:12,914
They've all flown the nest.

40
00:02:13,156 --> 00:02:14,213
We're done.

41
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,468
We still have Jamie and Dewey.

42
00:02:18,454 --> 00:02:19,254
I'm all packed up.

43
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:20,787
Good for you.

44
00:02:21,414 --> 00:02:22,121
Are you going somewhere?

45
00:02:22,221 --> 00:02:23,212
He's going to Francis's.

46
00:02:23,446 --> 00:02:24,788
Let's go over the rules again.

47
00:02:25,176 --> 00:02:27,240
When you are on a bus,
what are you to do?

48
00:02:27,577 --> 00:02:30,695
Talk to no one, don't let anyone
sit next to me, try to look sickly

49
00:02:30,696 --> 00:02:34,233
and learning-impaired, cough every
few minutes and nose-picking's okay.

50
00:02:34,234 --> 00:02:35,007
Encouraged.

51
00:02:35,493 --> 00:02:38,956
And what if you are on the bus for
a few hours and you have to go to
the bathroom really, really bad?

52
00:02:39,115 --> 00:02:40,006
I still don't go.

53
00:02:40,322 --> 00:02:41,092
That's my boy.

54
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:47,373
Mom, Dad, I would like to invite
you to a garage-warming.

55
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:51,168
Raduca thought that the least we
could do is show our appreciation
by treating you to a meal.

56
00:02:52,207 --> 00:02:54,943
-Well, I don't know what to say.
-We would be delighted to come.

57
00:02:55,111 --> 00:02:55,718
What are we having?

58
00:02:56,891 --> 00:03:00,155
Looks like baloney, some
kind of yellow cheese,

59
00:03:00,156 --> 00:03:02,363
half liter of Mountain Dew and...

60
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:04,418
Wheat Crisps.

61
00:03:04,692 --> 00:03:05,233
Wonderful.

62
00:03:08,876 --> 00:03:09,333
Huh?

63
00:03:10,404 --> 00:03:11,573
This is where you live?

64
00:03:11,765 --> 00:03:12,240
Yeah.

65
00:03:12,663 --> 00:03:13,514
Where's Piama?

66
00:03:13,856 --> 00:03:14,989
Her sister's in prison.

67
00:03:15,854 --> 00:03:17,433
Or marrying somebody in prison.

68
00:03:18,076 --> 00:03:19,293
Whatever it was,
she bought a dress.

69
00:03:19,576 --> 00:03:21,243
So what's the deal with the beard?

70
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:21,989
Oh, this thing?

71
00:03:22,761 --> 00:03:25,988
I don't know. I was trying to find a job
and not really finding anything and...

72
00:03:26,354 --> 00:03:28,391
kinda felt like something
was holding me back.

73
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:30,391
I think this makes me
stand out from the crowd.

74
00:03:30,523 --> 00:03:31,542
Mission accomplished.

75
00:03:33,251 --> 00:03:34,363
So this is how you live?

76
00:03:34,851 --> 00:03:39,908
No fridge, no real furniture, and the
only decoration's a stolen bus bench?

77
00:03:40,084 --> 00:03:40,734
Isn't that great?

78
00:03:41,047 --> 00:03:42,138
Francis, this is...

79
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:45,147
everything I've ever dreamed of!

80
00:03:45,507 --> 00:03:47,685
This is exactly how I'll
live when I grow up!

81
00:03:47,743 --> 00:03:48,545
Thanks, Dewey.

82
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:51,405
You know, it's not easy to
create this kind of lifestyle.

83
00:03:51,751 --> 00:03:52,820
Hey, you want to
listen to some music?

84
00:03:52,822 --> 00:03:53,224
Sure.

85
00:03:55,842 --> 00:03:59,069
Hey, Kipler, turn
that crap down!

86
00:04:02,578 --> 00:04:05,280
Feel that bass?
That's a powered subwoofer!

87
00:04:07,492 --> 00:04:08,603
I'm not going to be mean.

88
00:04:08,604 --> 00:04:11,760
I'm going to very nicely tell them their
marriage is a sham and must be dissolved.

89
00:04:11,762 --> 00:04:15,149
That might backfire. Look what happened
when my mother tried that with us.

90
00:04:15,162 --> 00:04:16,456
And what choice do we have?

91
00:04:16,696 --> 00:04:19,331
We can't let them live like
hobos in our filthy garage.

92
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,345
So beautiful.

93
00:04:29,558 --> 00:04:31,018
Please to enter.

94
00:04:32,691 --> 00:04:36,509
Raduca, I have to say it is incredible
what you've done with this place.

95
00:04:36,615 --> 00:04:38,470
No, no, no, this was Reese.

96
00:04:38,816 --> 00:04:39,818
He gets credit.

97
00:04:39,913 --> 00:04:41,843
Reese... you did this?

98
00:04:42,223 --> 00:04:45,623
He is very determined
when you give him task.

99
00:04:45,631 --> 00:04:47,285
Now, sweetie, you can't
give me all the credit.

100
00:04:47,505 --> 00:04:49,236
We both stomped that
spider nest together.

101
00:04:49,739 --> 00:04:52,250
Ah, yes, honeymoon.

102
00:04:52,757 --> 00:04:54,552
I am very impressed.

103
00:04:55,232 --> 00:04:56,564
Is this homework?!

104
00:04:56,925 --> 00:04:59,638
Yeah, Raduca won't let me watch
any television until it's finished.

105
00:05:00,183 --> 00:05:01,126
Wives. Am I right?

106
00:05:01,713 --> 00:05:04,778
Education is key to better life.

107
00:05:06,169 --> 00:05:06,719
Reese!

108
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:07,714
Chair!

109
00:05:12,263 --> 00:05:15,603
I can't remember when I've
had a baloney and Wheat-Crisp
casserole this good.

110
00:05:16,067 --> 00:05:18,892
Reese has studying
for green card exam.

111
00:05:19,346 --> 00:05:22,277
We must know every spouse's detail.

112
00:05:22,762 --> 00:05:26,677
Favorite color, toilet habit,
my menstruation cycle.

113
00:05:26,694 --> 00:05:27,463
I think I'm done.

114
00:05:28,111 --> 00:05:29,619
Reese! Plates!

115
00:05:38,383 --> 00:05:40,085
Did you see the way
she talks to him?

116
00:05:40,525 --> 00:05:42,228
She has broken his spirit.

117
00:05:42,568 --> 00:05:44,476
-He's not our Reese anymore.
-I know.

118
00:05:45,462 --> 00:05:47,054
-It's fantastic.
-Yeah.

119
00:05:48,905 --> 00:05:50,519
Here's our little scholar.

120
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:52,135
What?

121
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:55,462
Malcolm, this is Milt Anderson,
a recruiter from M.I.T.

122
00:05:56,074 --> 00:05:56,495
Dad...

123
00:05:56,596 --> 00:05:59,372
We talked about this, and
you're sitting here and listening
to what he has to say, got it?

124
00:05:59,461 --> 00:05:59,732
But...

125
00:05:59,743 --> 00:06:01,985
Now, Malcolm, I know
you've got a lot of questions.

126
00:06:04,314 --> 00:06:04,643
Yeah.

127
00:06:09,267 --> 00:06:10,094
You're from M.I.T.

128
00:06:10,235 --> 00:06:13,504
That's right. Mississippi
Institute of Technology.

129
00:06:13,989 --> 00:06:14,297
What?

130
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:17,571
Now, I know everybody always
assumes it's Massachusetts.

131
00:06:17,575 --> 00:06:20,483
And hey, they do good work,
too, but can they offer you

132
00:06:20,484 --> 00:06:23,934
the same kind of God-centric
approach to science that we do?

133
00:06:25,951 --> 00:06:27,596
Now, I know you're a gentleman,

134
00:06:28,068 --> 00:06:32,197
and you're not going to want to make
a decision until you come down and...

135
00:06:32,303 --> 00:06:36,107
taste some of the best catfish that
ever melted into your mouth!

136
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,416
Dad, could I talk
to you for a second?

137
00:06:39,838 --> 00:06:40,535
Of course.

138
00:06:41,836 --> 00:06:43,516
Any chance you could air
ship some of those ?

139
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:47,903
Dad, this is a complete waste of time.

140
00:06:48,483 --> 00:06:50,787
I've already told you there are only
four colleges in the whole world

141
00:06:50,788 --> 00:06:52,900
that have the nuclear biology
programs that I'm interested in.

142
00:06:53,202 --> 00:06:56,490
And this M.I.T. and Kolumbia
with a K aren't on the list.

143
00:06:56,495 --> 00:06:59,976
Maybe this isn't the school of your
dreams, but you need a fallback position.

144
00:06:59,984 --> 00:07:00,707
Forget about it, Dad.

145
00:07:00,869 --> 00:07:03,233
This is my decision and
I'm not talking to these bozos.

146
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,541
All right, fine.
I'll do it for you.

147
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:07,003
But one day, you'll thank me.

148
00:07:09,089 --> 00:07:11,556
Uh, Milt, you'll have
to excuse Malcolm.

149
00:07:11,592 --> 00:07:15,731
He, uh, had to do some...
brain exercises.

150
00:07:15,931 --> 00:07:17,743
You know, mental squats
and such. Anyway...

151
00:07:18,217 --> 00:07:20,070
tell me about your
science department.

152
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:22,814
Well, I'd love to.
Let me just find my brochure.

153
00:07:23,867 --> 00:07:27,112
Here, why don't you take
one of my key chains?

154
00:07:27,957 --> 00:07:28,925
It lights up!

155
00:07:30,341 --> 00:07:31,279
What else you got in there?

156
00:07:32,843 --> 00:07:34,172
I like that beer cozy.

157
00:07:34,731 --> 00:07:36,923
But I suppose it's either or.

158
00:07:45,415 --> 00:07:47,179
Why do we have to get
a stupid green card anyway?

159
00:07:47,204 --> 00:07:48,715
I hate studying. It's so boring.

160
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:51,314
Shut up and look at my breasts!

161
00:07:51,427 --> 00:07:53,752
This is the kind of thing
that it will be on test.

162
00:07:54,211 --> 00:07:57,143
Note the number and the
position of the beauty marks.

163
00:07:57,397 --> 00:07:58,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

164
00:07:58,519 --> 00:07:59,427
Eyes down here!

165
00:08:03,785 --> 00:08:04,375
I'm sorry.

166
00:08:05,011 --> 00:08:05,695
That's okay.

167
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:09,181
Sometimes it's better to see
water slides from a distance.

168
00:08:09,242 --> 00:08:12,768
You make plans for a perfectly good time,
and they go and fix the hole in the fence.

169
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:15,348
I just wish I had the kind
of money to buy us tickets.

170
00:08:15,384 --> 00:08:16,973
I would have lent you the six bucks.

171
00:08:16,976 --> 00:08:18,414
Hey, I don't roll that way.

172
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:21,014
It's bad enough I'm letting my little
brother buy me dinner tonight.

173
00:08:21,695 --> 00:08:22,752
So what do you want to do until then?

174
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:24,189
We could wrestle.

175
00:08:25,029 --> 00:08:26,572
You want to wrestle
for seven hours?

176
00:08:27,617 --> 00:08:29,046
<i>You in there!
Were is my rent?</i>

177
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:32,116
Mr. Banner, I can't open
the door right now.

178
00:08:32,141 --> 00:08:32,954
Bark right now.

179
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:37,309
It's my dog. He's crazy.

180
00:08:38,325 --> 00:08:39,112
And big.

181
00:08:50,401 --> 00:08:52,411
So, Greco-Roman or freestyle?

182
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:59,755
Oh, no. No more studying.
I need a break.

183
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:02,019
Reese, what are you doing here?!

184
00:09:03,383 --> 00:09:03,970
What's that?

185
00:09:04,457 --> 00:09:05,161
Who's there?

186
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:09,577
Raduca, who is this?!

187
00:09:09,695 --> 00:09:16,280
Um, this is, um, Bela, and I have
known him for many years because...

188
00:09:17,753 --> 00:09:19,956
he is my brother.

189
00:09:20,834 --> 00:09:22,162
I can't believe you!

190
00:09:23,561 --> 00:09:25,605
You had your brother in
town and don't tell me?!

191
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:28,768
Get over here!

192
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,269
Sorry I kept you boys waiting.

193
00:09:37,781 --> 00:09:39,143
I thought I had 4:30.

194
00:09:39,265 --> 00:09:41,137
You told me 4:30 a week ago.

195
00:09:41,154 --> 00:09:43,026
Boys, please, it's my fault.

196
00:09:43,465 --> 00:09:46,587
I've just had so many recruiters calling,
they've got me coming and going.

197
00:09:47,099 --> 00:09:47,482
Tea?

198
00:09:47,899 --> 00:09:48,680
Waybridge, huh?

199
00:09:49,421 --> 00:09:50,786
Guess Nick beat us here.

200
00:09:50,883 --> 00:09:52,184
I just like the color.

201
00:09:52,483 --> 00:09:53,812
It doesn't mean anything.

202
00:09:54,031 --> 00:09:56,029
You know, Grandville
has terrific sweaters.

203
00:09:56,137 --> 00:10:00,166
In fact, we have a collapsible
umbrella people love.

204
00:10:00,301 --> 00:10:02,845
Please, it's not about merchandise.

205
00:10:03,378 --> 00:10:04,506
It's about education.

206
00:10:05,608 --> 00:10:08,299
Of course, it is easier to study
when you're dry and toasty.

207
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:10,634
You got it.

208
00:10:11,864 --> 00:10:15,114
Now... tell me about your
respective universities.

209
00:10:15,204 --> 00:10:18,317
At Grandville, the head of our physics
department just won a Nobel prize.

210
00:10:18,721 --> 00:10:19,669
That's very impressive.

211
00:10:19,753 --> 00:10:21,647
At Euclid, we think it's about results.

212
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:27,117
For example, 70% of Euclid graduates
take care of their parents in retirement.

213
00:10:27,528 --> 00:10:28,714
Oh, I like that.

214
00:10:28,732 --> 00:10:31,044
How can you keep those stats?
Do you have no shame?

215
00:10:31,179 --> 00:10:32,735
Your Nobel prize was shared, okay?

216
00:10:32,826 --> 00:10:33,976
Your cyclotron in underfunded.

217
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:34,710
How dare you!

218
00:10:34,711 --> 00:10:35,327
Boys...

219
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:37,962
Excuse me.

220
00:10:39,072 --> 00:10:39,508
Hello.

221
00:10:41,319 --> 00:10:43,572
Oh, um, yes.

222
00:10:46,134 --> 00:10:49,269
Hi, Barry. Yes, I've been
thinking about you, too.

223
00:10:49,344 --> 00:10:50,316
Listen, I can't talk.

224
00:10:50,396 --> 00:10:51,622
Is that Barry from Michigan?

225
00:10:52,562 --> 00:10:54,144
Well, never you mind who's here.

226
00:10:55,152 --> 00:10:56,164
Yes, I got your muffins.

227
00:10:56,169 --> 00:10:57,925
They were delicious and
very thoughtful of you.

228
00:10:59,017 --> 00:11:01,449
Oh, stop! You are relentless.

229
00:11:02,059 --> 00:11:04,043
I hope I didn't keep you up
last night with all that noise.

230
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:06,213
Geez, Reese, I don't want
to hear about your sex life.

231
00:11:06,293 --> 00:11:06,597
What?

232
00:11:06,998 --> 00:11:09,020
No, I was getting the oil
stains out of the driveway.

233
00:11:10,088 --> 00:11:12,655
For your information,
marriage isn't just about sex.

234
00:11:12,927 --> 00:11:13,933
It's about commitment.

235
00:11:14,352 --> 00:11:16,540
Anyway, you know we can't have
sex until after the waiting period.

236
00:11:17,116 --> 00:11:18,029
The waiting period?

237
00:11:19,668 --> 00:11:21,071
Poor, naive Malcolm.

238
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,004
All women, when they get married, require
a waiting period of six months to a year.

239
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:29,549
You know, if you got your nose out
of a book, and started living life a
little, you might know these things.

240
00:11:29,692 --> 00:11:31,332
Raduca is a delicate flower,

241
00:11:31,555 --> 00:11:34,079
and it's going to take some time for her to
get used to the idea of being with a man.

242
00:11:34,438 --> 00:11:35,063
Who's that?

243
00:11:36,216 --> 00:11:37,135
Her brother Bela.

244
00:11:39,392 --> 00:11:40,839
Doesn't look much like her.

245
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:41,885
Shows how much you know.

246
00:11:42,004 --> 00:11:44,183
I've never seen two
people closer in my life.

247
00:11:47,812 --> 00:11:51,514
Mom, when  Raduca found out
I took the food out of your
refrigerator, she was pretty upset.

248
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:53,349
She says we shouldn't
be living off you.

249
00:11:53,716 --> 00:11:54,470
Really?

250
00:11:55,058 --> 00:11:57,792
I owe you 14 slices of bologna...

251
00:11:59,493 --> 00:12:01,232
a half a liter of soda...

252
00:12:05,112 --> 00:12:07,289
Reese, I was against your
marriage from the beginning.

253
00:12:07,292 --> 00:12:10,489
I thought it was a mistake for you
to be tied down so early in life.

254
00:12:10,493 --> 00:12:15,948
But, I see you and Raduca together and,
I must say, I think she's good for you.

255
00:12:17,182 --> 00:12:17,612
You do?

256
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:19,970
Why are you saying that?

257
00:12:20,452 --> 00:12:22,172
Well, I'm giving you my blessing.

258
00:12:23,219 --> 00:12:24,237
I see what's happening here.

259
00:12:24,732 --> 00:12:26,120
You're using reverse psychology.

260
00:12:26,783 --> 00:12:27,457
It's not working.

261
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:31,757
No, I'm really just saying that
I like her, and I like how you
are when you're with her.

262
00:12:31,828 --> 00:12:33,884
Nice try, Mom, but
I'm staying with Raduca.

263
00:12:34,358 --> 00:12:36,112
And I approve.

264
00:12:36,147 --> 00:12:37,570
You'd like me to think
so, wouldn't you?

265
00:12:37,704 --> 00:12:38,815
Yes, I would.

266
00:12:38,877 --> 00:12:40,094
Well, I'm staying with her, Mom.

267
00:12:40,382 --> 00:12:41,803
Check and mate.

268
00:12:44,129 --> 00:12:47,884
Well, if you were worried about
today's activities, you can just relax.

269
00:12:48,444 --> 00:12:53,071
My neighbors are on vacation, so
good-bye, Seelys, hello, cable television.

270
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:55,776
I have a better idea.

271
00:12:56,631 --> 00:12:58,462
There's a job center
I thought we could go to.

272
00:12:58,907 --> 00:12:59,984
Oh, I get it.

273
00:13:00,257 --> 00:13:02,043
My little bro is worried about me.

274
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,319
Maybe a little.

275
00:13:04,605 --> 00:13:06,176
Plus, cable is so overrated.

276
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:11,560
Look, Dewey, I know it may seem
like I don't have a lot going on, but
I've got plenty of irons in the fire.

277
00:13:12,092 --> 00:13:12,984
Like my screenplay.

278
00:13:18,865 --> 00:13:20,254
It's only five pages.

279
00:13:20,277 --> 00:13:23,555
They're probably going to bring
in some high-priced rewriter.
Why should I do his work for him?

280
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:26,220
Do you have any other irons?

281
00:13:26,611 --> 00:13:30,931
Look, I know it's tough to break
into Hollywood. I'd be pretty
stupid to rest everything on that.

282
00:13:31,623 --> 00:13:32,949
That's why I'm training a possum.

283
00:13:33,335 --> 00:13:34,104
To do what?

284
00:13:34,276 --> 00:13:37,141
Dial a phone, hop on one foot,
walk like John Wayne...

285
00:13:37,456 --> 00:13:39,947
Stuff that people who visit
roadside circuses like to see.

286
00:13:40,646 --> 00:13:42,375
So, does that put your mind at ease?

287
00:13:43,362 --> 00:13:45,140
Francis, you have to get a life.

288
00:13:45,414 --> 00:13:46,372
I have a life.

289
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:50,815
I've got my hobbies, my bus bench,
the guys at the apartment pool.

290
00:13:50,892 --> 00:13:53,275
I'm only 12, and I can see
that this is a dead end.

291
00:13:54,612 --> 00:13:56,840
So you know what
I should do better than I do.

292
00:13:57,761 --> 00:13:58,827
You're just like Mom.

293
00:13:58,904 --> 00:13:59,986
Maybe Mom has a point.

294
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:03,684
Maybe just hanging out by
the pool isn't going to be the
stepping-stone you're hoping for.

295
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:05,003
You never supported me!

296
00:14:05,009 --> 00:14:07,470
All I'm saying is jobs don't
just drop out of the sky.

297
00:14:07,476 --> 00:14:08,382
I hate you!

298
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:13,835
Fighting Irish or Golden Gophers?

299
00:14:15,218 --> 00:14:16,431
Blue and gold.

300
00:14:16,445 --> 00:14:17,853
Dad, I'm sorry.

301
00:14:18,474 --> 00:14:19,913
I know we fought about this, but,

302
00:14:20,121 --> 00:14:22,728
the truth is I'm actually glad you
kept those college guys off my back.

303
00:14:23,688 --> 00:14:25,908
Well, son, it hasn't been easy.

304
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:29,932
Today I've got two
lunches, a coffee...

305
00:14:30,285 --> 00:14:32,572
Oh! And I'm going bowling
with a guy from Yale.

306
00:14:32,907 --> 00:14:35,037
Thanks to you, I was able to clear
my head and make my decision.

307
00:14:35,995 --> 00:14:36,875
No, you haven't.

308
00:14:37,163 --> 00:14:38,972
I have a lobster dinner next Tuesday.

309
00:14:39,062 --> 00:14:40,358
I've decided to go to Harvard.

310
00:14:42,141 --> 00:14:42,734
Harvard?

311
00:14:43,568 --> 00:14:47,736
I waited at that frozen yogurt shop
for two hours, and he never showed!

312
00:14:47,753 --> 00:14:50,472
I just wrote a letter of early
acceptance. I'm mailing it today.

313
00:14:50,735 --> 00:14:53,276
They can accept me as early as
tomorrow, and all this will stop.

314
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:54,363
Stop?

315
00:14:54,383 --> 00:14:55,182
Thanks again, Dad.

316
00:14:55,202 --> 00:14:56,258
It's a big relief to me.

317
00:14:57,528 --> 00:14:58,329
Harvard?

318
00:14:59,795 --> 00:15:01,515
You're destroying your life!

319
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:03,904
Sorry, Francis.

320
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,588
I guess visiting wasn't
such a great idea.

321
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:09,809
Thanks for trying to
show me a good time.

322
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:16,105
I only need bus fare to get home,
so I'm leaving you the rest.

323
00:15:22,942 --> 00:15:24,133
Good-bye, Francis.

324
00:15:25,405 --> 00:15:25,851
<i>Wait.</i>

325
00:15:30,108 --> 00:15:31,203
Francis, you look great.

326
00:15:31,812 --> 00:15:32,373
Thanks.

327
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:34,306
I realized you were right.

328
00:15:34,868 --> 00:15:38,063
For some reason, I'sitting around
waiting for my life to start happening.

329
00:15:38,357 --> 00:15:42,615
I know that it's childish amd immature
of me to think that some job is
just going to fall out of the sky.

330
00:15:47,188 --> 00:15:47,737
Hey, man, what's up?

331
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:50,174
Francis, you're never
going to believe this! Hey.

332
00:15:50,882 --> 00:15:53,129
Remember how you were
always telling us to "rock on"?

333
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,733
Yeah, Travis. Rock on.

334
00:15:54,816 --> 00:15:55,654
That's what we did!

335
00:15:55,802 --> 00:15:59,283
And now they signed my band,
Ass Bandit, to a record contract.

336
00:15:59,451 --> 00:16:03,011
We actually have a song on the
radio, and we were wondering
if you wanted to manage us.

337
00:16:04,526 --> 00:16:05,037
Really?

338
00:16:05,211 --> 00:16:07,152
Yeah, man! You were
always there for us,

339
00:16:07,353 --> 00:16:09,652
borrowing our money so we
couldn't get wasted on beer,

340
00:16:09,705 --> 00:16:13,697
taking our car so we'd be stuck
here and have to practice all
the time, and it totally paid off.

341
00:16:14,052 --> 00:16:16,101
Now we are going to tour Europe!

342
00:16:16,567 --> 00:16:17,831
You got to come with us, Francis.

343
00:16:18,315 --> 00:16:21,362
All you got to do is make sure the hotel
rooms kick ass and the chicks are hot.

344
00:16:21,922 --> 00:16:22,723
I don't know...

345
00:16:23,201 --> 00:16:24,459
Sounds like a lot of traveling.

346
00:16:25,903 --> 00:16:26,699
Aw, what the hell?

347
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:27,403
I'll do it.

348
00:16:37,325 --> 00:16:37,982
<i>Tawny port.</i>

349
00:16:38,892 --> 00:16:40,226
I want this to be
a night to remember.

350
00:16:40,675 --> 00:16:41,740
I think it could be.

351
00:16:42,851 --> 00:16:46,831
Malcolm told me that he was very
excited about Bagley-Owens University.

352
00:16:47,608 --> 00:16:49,240
Well, we're very
excited about Malcolm.

353
00:16:50,795 --> 00:16:51,792
Are you really?

354
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:56,211
Well, perhaps this
will convince you.

355
00:16:58,444 --> 00:16:59,669
Oh, Vince...

356
00:17:01,953 --> 00:17:02,978
I don't know what to say.

357
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,521
Just say, "Yes, Malcolm will
be going to Bagley next fall."

358
00:17:14,863 --> 00:17:16,983
I'm such a mess, I can't even
get it on my finger.

359
00:17:17,034 --> 00:17:17,577
Let me help.

360
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:20,731
Dad...

361
00:17:21,512 --> 00:17:23,122
Malcolm, what are you doing here?

362
00:17:23,145 --> 00:17:26,218
What was my letter of intent to Harvard
doing in your secret money drawer?

363
00:17:27,404 --> 00:17:27,913
Harvard?

364
00:17:29,627 --> 00:17:30,565
Is this true, Hal?

365
00:17:30,643 --> 00:17:31,617
You're damn right it is!

366
00:17:31,703 --> 00:17:33,189
I think this dinner's over.

367
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:34,975
-Vince, I can explain.
-I don't want to hear it.

368
00:17:41,612 --> 00:17:42,433
Good-bye, Vince.

369
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,298
This is my decision.

370
00:17:49,891 --> 00:17:50,817
My future.

371
00:17:50,841 --> 00:17:51,657
You're a kid.

372
00:17:51,793 --> 00:17:54,711
You could change your mind.
You just needed a cooling-off period.

373
00:17:55,382 --> 00:17:58,481
I almost married a Mexican woman
two weeks before I married your mother.

374
00:17:59,844 --> 00:18:00,450
What are you doing?

375
00:18:01,385 --> 00:18:05,231
You're mortgaging my future for
some dinners and a few sweaters?

376
00:18:05,301 --> 00:18:08,384
I got other stuff:
ponchos, seat cushions...

377
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:12,982
All right, I was going to let
you make the final decision,

378
00:18:16,775 --> 00:18:18,319
I just liked the attention.

379
00:18:19,059 --> 00:18:21,903
No,no... I loved the attention.

380
00:18:23,623 --> 00:18:26,115
If I was a woman, I'd be a slut.

381
00:18:26,853 --> 00:18:28,394
You were just leading
all these guys on.

382
00:18:28,526 --> 00:18:29,642
I know.

383
00:18:30,587 --> 00:18:31,285
It's just...

384
00:18:34,814 --> 00:18:38,317
Malcolm, I'm an average guy,
in the middle of my life,

385
00:18:38,517 --> 00:18:40,995
in a job that can
replace me in an hour.

386
00:18:41,613 --> 00:18:43,027
I was never an important man.

387
00:18:44,696 --> 00:18:46,765
You're the only important
thing I've ever done.

388
00:18:49,443 --> 00:18:51,116
Oh, God!

389
00:18:52,972 --> 00:18:54,102
Don't feel bad, Dad.

390
00:18:55,122 --> 00:18:55,950
You raised me.

391
00:18:56,261 --> 00:18:57,213
You deserve the attention.

392
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:58,021
No!

393
00:18:58,984 --> 00:19:00,567
Vince left the check.

394
00:19:05,975 --> 00:19:06,754
Reese, what's wrong?

395
00:19:07,301 --> 00:19:09,602
I got the results of our green
card test in this envelope.

396
00:19:10,044 --> 00:19:11,116
But I just can't open it!

397
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,356
I know I didn't pass.
I totally panicked.

398
00:19:13,478 --> 00:19:15,781
Oh, Reese, don't be silly.

399
00:19:16,348 --> 00:19:19,909
These tests are for people who aren't
living together. Who aren't in love.

400
00:19:20,361 --> 00:19:22,593
You have a real marriage.
This is no problem.

401
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:24,966
-But, Mom, what if I...?
-You'll be fine.

402
00:19:25,579 --> 00:19:27,564
This is a mother's
promise to her son.

403
00:19:34,149 --> 00:19:37,438
Oh, wow, Reese. I'm so, so sorry.

404
00:19:37,569 --> 00:19:38,856
Quit stalling! How did I do?

405
00:19:40,475 --> 00:19:43,525
The INS is denying Raduca's
request for a green card.

406
00:19:44,063 --> 00:19:45,813
They're questioning the
validity of your marriage.

407
00:19:45,814 --> 00:19:47,694
They want her to report
to their office tomorrow.

408
00:19:49,469 --> 00:19:51,206
You said Raduca had a tail?

409
00:19:51,466 --> 00:19:52,463
Might have a tail!

410
00:19:52,468 --> 00:19:54,898
I don't know what the hell is going
on back there! I was nervous.

411
00:19:54,939 --> 00:19:56,827
Reese, I feel just terrible.

412
00:19:56,837 --> 00:19:57,396
That's it.

413
00:19:58,330 --> 00:19:59,393
It's the end of my marriage.

414
00:19:59,944 --> 00:20:02,017
The one thing that was going
right in my life is ruined.

415
00:20:02,151 --> 00:20:03,642
No, Reese. Nothing is ruined.

416
00:20:04,173 --> 00:20:06,946
If you love this girl, you'll
find a way to overcome this obstacle.

417
00:20:07,459 --> 00:20:08,236
I don't know.

418
00:20:08,276 --> 00:20:10,886
Remember when I told you
you couldn't keep that tarantula?

419
00:20:11,237 --> 00:20:14,008
Six months later, what
did I find in my salad?

420
00:20:15,453 --> 00:20:16,206
My tarantula.

421
00:20:16,242 --> 00:20:17,983
You hung onto it
because you loved it.

422
00:20:18,239 --> 00:20:19,604
And you love Raduca.

423
00:20:20,221 --> 00:20:23,183
We are not going to let the United States
government smash her with a shoe.

424
00:20:23,384 --> 00:20:23,745
Come on.

425
00:20:24,286 --> 00:20:26,583
Let's go tell her we'll figure out
a way to work this thing out.

426
00:20:34,016 --> 00:20:35,053
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

427
00:20:35,351 --> 00:20:37,539
<i>How come your brother
doesn't have a waiting period?!</i>

428
00:20:41,952 --> 00:20:43,880
Dewey, I just got off the phone
with your English teacher.

429
00:20:43,883 --> 00:20:46,260
She said you got an
"F" on your paper.

430
00:20:47,406 --> 00:20:48,146
An "F"!

431
00:20:48,577 --> 00:20:51,099
You keep this up, you'll fail the
class, which will go on your record,

432
00:20:51,101 --> 00:20:53,112
which will determine where
you are placed in high school

433
00:20:53,113 --> 00:20:55,107
and where you will go
to college, if anywhere.

434
00:20:55,324 --> 00:20:56,368
Don't go to college.

435
00:20:56,445 --> 00:20:57,422
It's okay with me.

436
00:21:00,081 --> 00:21:01,842
How do you think you're going
to make your way in the world?

437
00:21:02,239 --> 00:21:03,170
You don't get it, Mom.

438
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:04,812
Things take care of themselves.

439
00:21:06,852 --> 00:21:07,777
Rock on.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
