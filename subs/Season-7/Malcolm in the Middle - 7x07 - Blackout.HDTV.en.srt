1
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:23,550
Dr. Baxter's Corvette?

2
00:00:24,217 --> 00:00:25,490
Mrs. Smith's mini-van.

3
00:00:25,681 --> 00:00:27,031
I want to savor the moment.

4
00:00:30,725 --> 00:00:34,875

5
00:00:38,462 --> 00:00:39,562
Have you seen Malcolm?

6
00:00:39,751 --> 00:00:41,275
No! And you haven't either.

7
00:00:41,915 --> 00:00:43,053
-I haven't.
-Good.

8
00:00:43,266 --> 00:00:44,492
Then we understand each other.

9
00:00:44,522 --> 00:00:46,028
And you're going to make
yourself scarce tonight.

10
00:00:46,058 --> 00:00:46,858
But I'm cooking.

11
00:00:49,003 --> 00:00:51,895
Mom and Dad are going out
for their anniversary and
they're letting me pick dinner.

12
00:00:51,925 --> 00:00:53,367
I'm not eating
cereal for dinner!

13
00:00:53,397 --> 00:00:54,285
Yes, you are.

14
00:00:54,381 --> 00:00:58,287
Dad said if I emptied out the
rat traps in the crawl space,
then I get to pick dinner.

15
00:00:58,317 --> 00:00:59,108
That's funny.

16
00:00:59,778 --> 00:01:03,532
He didn't consult me, seeing as
I have the fist and you have the face.

17
00:01:04,418 --> 00:01:06,122
Reese says I don't
get to pick dinner.

18
00:01:06,152 --> 00:01:07,087
He's right, you don't.

19
00:01:07,117 --> 00:01:10,909
Change of plans. Your mother and
I are celebrating our anniversary
at home. We're having steaks.

20
00:01:10,939 --> 00:01:11,806
No fair!

21
00:01:12,002 --> 00:01:13,680
I wiped up rat brains!

22
00:01:13,851 --> 00:01:14,917
You promised!

23
00:01:14,931 --> 00:01:18,810
Dewey, if I kept half the promises
I made, this family would plunge
into chaos.

24
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,927
You come with me now.

25
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:25,700
I didn't do anything!

26
00:01:26,808 --> 00:01:27,608
What's going on?

27
00:01:29,738 --> 00:01:30,452
Kobe.

28
00:01:30,928 --> 00:01:31,334
What?

29
00:01:31,886 --> 00:01:34,133
I have Kobe beef.

30
00:01:34,162 --> 00:01:35,396
-No way.
-Yes!

31
00:01:35,465 --> 00:01:36,881
That's like $60 an ounce.

32
00:01:36,898 --> 00:01:39,387
I know. I won it in a
Minesweeper tournament at work.

33
00:01:39,417 --> 00:01:42,367
Years of practicing eight hours
a day has finally paid off.

34
00:01:43,666 --> 00:01:45,566
<i>I've never even
seen Kobe beef.</i>

35
00:01:46,116 --> 00:01:47,947
It's like meeting the Pope,
but you get to eat him.

36
00:01:47,977 --> 00:01:52,376
Exactly. But this is treated much better
than any pope was or ever will be.

37
00:01:52,499 --> 00:01:54,558
It lives on beer and ice cream.

38
00:01:54,567 --> 00:01:59,700
And right up until the moment
of slaughter, its rump and thighs
are massaged by geishas.

39
00:01:59,716 --> 00:02:01,058
It should be eating us.

40
00:02:07,882 --> 00:02:08,678
There's only two.

41
00:02:08,708 --> 00:02:11,666
One for me... one for the chef.

42
00:02:12,542 --> 00:02:15,564
You are the only person in this family
qualified to cook up these babies.

43
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:18,274
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

44
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:19,884
Mom doesn't get any
on her anniversary?

45
00:02:19,914 --> 00:02:20,864
You didn't hear me.

46
00:02:20,901 --> 00:02:22,205
Once in a lifetime.

47
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:24,099
I've had 22 anniversaries.

48
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,599
I'm telling your mother I screwed
up the reservations and we're
having a steak dinner at home.

49
00:02:27,629 --> 00:02:31,979
You cook up these next to the
prison-grade crap that I'm
giving the rest of the family.

50
00:02:32,248 --> 00:02:33,048
Where's Malcolm?

51
00:02:34,306 --> 00:02:36,707
I have no idea where Malcolm
is or what he's doing...

52
00:02:36,737 --> 00:02:39,757
Or why he's doing whatever it is
that I don't know what he's doing.

53
00:02:39,787 --> 00:02:42,787
All right, I know you're hiding
something, but I don't care.

54
00:02:54,254 --> 00:02:57,937
No, no, Jamie, I don't want
anyone to know I'm here.

55
00:03:00,777 --> 00:03:01,319
Look...

56
00:03:01,463 --> 00:03:02,370
Here's a toy.

57
00:03:03,358 --> 00:03:04,805
See? Fun.

58
00:03:17,117 --> 00:03:17,600

-I paid the bill.

62
00:03:31,249 --> 00:03:32,649
It's the whole neighborhood.

63
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,521
See?

64
00:03:33,858 --> 00:03:35,903
God wants our evil plan to work.

65
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:36,492
Go.

66
00:03:36,727 --> 00:03:38,637
<i>Hal! I can't see anything!</i>

67
00:03:38,679 --> 00:03:40,044
I'll find a flashlight.

68
00:03:43,738 --> 00:03:45,088
Oh, would you look at that.

69
00:03:45,431 --> 00:03:49,631
Is there a single neighbor that
lends us something that doesn't
have dead batteries?

70
00:03:50,437 --> 00:03:51,922
-What was that?
-I'll check.

71
00:03:51,942 --> 00:03:53,743
Maybe an emboldened possum.

72
00:04:07,185 --> 00:04:07,995
Francis!

73
00:04:08,385 --> 00:04:08,790
Mom.

74
00:04:08,795 --> 00:04:10,213
What are you doing here?

75
00:04:10,656 --> 00:04:12,161
I... need a bandage.

76
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,457
I tripped over something in the
garage, when the lights went out.

77
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:16,358
What were you doing
in the garage?

78
00:04:16,663 --> 00:04:19,313
I was hiding from Dad.
I wanted to talk to you first.

79
00:04:19,673 --> 00:04:23,781
Francis, your father and I have
a joint checking account. It doesn't
matter who you talk to first.

80
00:04:23,811 --> 00:04:27,639
No, it's just... you know how emotional
he gets. I don't want him overreacting
when he hears what happened.

81
00:04:27,669 --> 00:04:28,614
What happened?

82
00:04:30,151 --> 00:04:31,733
I think my marriage is over.

83
00:04:33,667 --> 00:04:35,380
-That's bad news.
-Of course it is.

84
00:04:35,824 --> 00:04:36,545
What's going on?

85
00:04:36,575 --> 00:04:38,408
We've been fighting
about everything lately.

86
00:04:38,438 --> 00:04:42,201
I mean, how do you answer
when someone asks, "Does your
face have to look like that?"

87
00:04:42,231 --> 00:04:43,581
I put up with her face.

88
00:04:43,681 --> 00:04:45,948
With that nose always
pointing at me.

89
00:04:45,988 --> 00:04:47,113
Oh, Francis...

90
00:04:47,225 --> 00:04:51,406
I still love her; I don't want
it to end, but I just... I don't
see how it's going to last.

91
00:04:51,436 --> 00:04:53,786
<i>Lois, can you come
out here? I need you.</i>

92
00:04:53,806 --> 00:04:55,190
Just don't tell Dad, okay?

93
00:04:55,191 --> 00:04:57,252
He'll be a mess and I'll end
up having to take care of him.

94
00:04:57,282 --> 00:05:01,256
Okay, I'll get your father out of the
way and then you and I can talk later.

95
00:05:07,419 --> 00:05:09,889
Francis, I'm so
glad you're here.

96
00:05:10,006 --> 00:05:13,533
Dad promised we'd all have cereal for
dinner tonight, and now he won't let us.

97
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:15,287
Dewey, I understand.

98
00:05:15,421 --> 00:05:19,321
And I swear to you by all that is holy
that you will be eating cereal tonight.

99
00:05:19,533 --> 00:05:20,555
You can count on me.

100
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,429
You're not going to do
anything, are you?

101
00:05:22,459 --> 00:05:23,087
No, I'm not.

102
00:05:23,425 --> 00:05:24,644
But I'll tell you
what I will do.

103
00:05:24,674 --> 00:05:27,784
If you let anyone know I'm here,
I will punch you so hard in the stomach,

104
00:05:27,814 --> 00:05:30,064
you won't be able to
eat cereal for two days.

105
00:05:30,115 --> 00:05:31,427
There. Problem solved.

106
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:35,925
<i>The bedroom, where you,
Hal, are headed right now.</i>

107
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:48,477
Where did that come from?

108
00:05:48,507 --> 00:05:50,757
I'm just trying to
celebrate our anniversary.

109
00:05:52,179 --> 00:05:52,989
Not just yet.

110
00:05:53,229 --> 00:05:54,679
I still have some work to do.

111
00:05:59,906 --> 00:06:02,106
Officer, what is this about?

112
00:06:02,757 --> 00:06:04,057
You better lock the doors.

113
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:07,650
Actually, Hal, you know, on second
thought, I'm really not in the mood.

114
00:06:09,007 --> 00:06:10,319
Oh, I see.

115
00:06:11,009 --> 00:06:12,147
Stoke the flame.

116
00:06:12,644 --> 00:06:14,496
Oh, I like the way you think.

117
00:06:30,912 --> 00:06:31,701
Hello?

118
00:06:32,265 --> 00:06:35,288
Malcolm! For God sakes,
we've been looking all over for you.

119
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:36,344
What?

120
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,229
Wait, slow down.
I can't understand what you're saying.

121
00:06:39,874 --> 00:06:40,951
Are you drunk?

122
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:42,696
-You are drunk!
-Who's drunk?

123
00:06:42,725 --> 00:06:45,825
Malcolm. He's drunk at a party
100 miles down the freeway.

124
00:06:45,983 --> 00:06:49,658
Now we both have to go down there,
pick him up and drive his car back.

125
00:06:49,665 --> 00:06:50,838
Oh, for God's sake!

126
00:06:51,515 --> 00:06:52,875
You know what would
teach him a lesson?

127
00:06:52,905 --> 00:06:55,205
If we made him wait until
after we ate dinner.

128
00:06:55,324 --> 00:06:57,260
Let him stew in his own juices.

129
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,262
His own delicious,
savory juices.

130
00:07:00,264 --> 00:07:02,332
Get your keys, Hal.
I'll meet you in the car.

131
00:07:02,362 --> 00:07:03,191
All right!

132
00:07:03,866 --> 00:07:06,116
Malcolm... you just stay
right where you are.

133
00:07:08,404 --> 00:07:09,677
I hate children.

134
00:07:19,177 --> 00:07:20,141
So clever.

135
00:07:20,334 --> 00:07:25,077
It'll take them two hours on the
highway, an hour to figure out I'm not
there and then two hours back.

136
00:07:25,107 --> 00:07:27,507
So I'd say I have about
five hours left to live.

137
00:07:27,716 --> 00:07:29,316
How about we make
it worthwhile?

138

Piama. Hi, baby.

147
00:08:12,671 --> 00:08:13,279
I found it.

00:08:13,428 --> 00:08:15,842
It is even more beautiful
than I remember.

149

I'm going to grab it and go. They
won't even know I was here. I love you.

Oh, did the blackout scare you?

153
00:08:52,972 --> 00:08:55,190
Listen, pal, I need the
batteries from one of your toys.

154

Where's that frog that used
to shock you in the bathtub?

Hey, Lois, can you come
out here? I need you.

What's this? I thought we were
going out for our anniversary.

00:09:11,547 --> 00:09:13,497
Honey, this is going
to be even better.

158
00:09:13,779 --> 00:09:18,044
We are going to stay
home and have Kobe beef.

159
00:09:19,121 --> 00:09:22,997
Okay, I thought you'd
be a little excited.

160
00:09:23,263 --> 00:09:26,118
Ah, I'm sorry, Hal.
I'm just a little lost in thought.

161
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:27,849
A friend at work
is having, um...

162
00:09:28,164 --> 00:09:29,456
marital problems.

163
00:09:30,265 --> 00:09:31,307
And that's very sad.

164
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:33,300
But we are going
to have Kobe beef.

165
00:09:33,566 --> 00:09:38,225
Reese is going to prepare its
flesh perfectly because he thinks
he's going to get some to eat.

166
00:09:38,255 --> 00:09:39,104
But he's not.

167
00:09:39,316 --> 00:09:40,590
Isn't that great?

168
00:09:41,046 --> 00:09:43,441
-That's a good scheme.
-You bet it's a good scheme.

169
00:09:43,471 --> 00:09:46,860
-Do you know where my apron is?
-I washed it, it's in the bedroom closet.

170
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:47,565
The bedroom.

171
00:09:47,757 --> 00:09:50,034
Where you, Hal,
are headed right now.

172
00:09:58,023 --> 00:09:59,393
Where did that come from?

173
00:09:59,413 --> 00:10:01,663
I'm just trying to
celebrate our anniversary.

174
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:16,167
Francis!

175
00:10:17,093 --> 00:10:17,537
Mom.

176
00:10:18,727 --> 00:10:22,175
I don't have a lot of time and I want
to talk to you about your marriage.

177
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:23,864
Oh, yeah, great.

178
00:10:24,614 --> 00:10:26,514
I'd love to hear what
you have to say.

179
00:10:26,691 --> 00:10:29,231
Have you and Piama
thought about, uh...

180
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:30,583
spicing things up?

181
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:31,982
What?

182
00:10:32,096 --> 00:10:35,814
Francis, if it isn't right in
the bedroom, it isn't going
to be right anywhere else.

183
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:36,168
What?

184
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:39,425
When I say "the
bedroom," I mean sex.

185
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:40,887
Yeah, I got it.

186
00:10:41,022 --> 00:10:42,990
Francis, marriage isn't mental.

187
00:10:43,048 --> 00:10:44,672
It isn't even really
about feelings.

188
00:10:44,702 --> 00:10:48,209
When you get  right down to it,
it's a sloppy, sweaty physical act.

189
00:10:48,225 --> 00:10:50,843
Now, your father may have flaws,he
may not make a lot of money,

190
00:10:50,873 --> 00:10:54,336
but he has never been other than
a rigorous and challenging lover.

191
00:10:54,494 --> 00:10:54,992
Mom...

192
00:10:55,126 --> 00:10:56,016
Can I be frank with you?

193
00:10:56,046 --> 00:10:56,495
No!

194
00:10:56,568 --> 00:10:59,665
Do you remember sometimes
in the morning I'd forget to put
juice in your lunchbox?

195
00:10:59,695 --> 00:11:02,113
I was lucky I could
remember my own name.

196
00:11:02,992 --> 00:11:09,468
Because, when your father gets down
to work, and is intimate with me, he is
like a skilled general invading a country.

197
00:11:09,482 --> 00:11:14,591
He doesn't just launch an assault
by sea, he uses paratroopers and
columns of infantry.

198
00:11:15,134 --> 00:11:16,541
And even secret agents.

199
00:11:19,306 --> 00:11:21,729
Honey, good for you.
Get it all out.

200
00:11:22,038 --> 00:11:23,292
We can talk more later.

201
00:11:31,634 --> 00:11:34,486
-I'm willing to propose a compromise.
-Dewey, give it up.

202
00:11:34,544 --> 00:11:36,294
You'll never get
anything you want.

203
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,099
We have to get rid
of Mom and Dad.

204
00:11:42,328 --> 00:11:44,420
-Don't worry about it.
-I am worried about it.

205
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:46,300
Those Dutch girls
won't hold forever.

206
00:11:49,571 --> 00:11:50,839
Dutch girls! No!

207
00:11:50,842 --> 00:11:52,246
Stay, Dutch girls, stay!

208
00:11:52,651 --> 00:11:53,905
We didn't have fun.

209
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:58,130
American parties are supposed to
have deejays and African-Americans.

210
00:11:58,348 --> 00:11:59,438
I'll get you those.

211
00:11:59,444 --> 00:12:00,450
<i>We are leaving.</i>

212
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,914
If we wanted to be bored,
we could go to Luxembourg.

213
00:12:02,944 --> 00:12:03,674
You can't go.

214
00:12:04,118 --> 00:12:07,420
While you were in there, a rock star
called and said he's going to come over.

215
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:10,045
We don't blame you for
our bitter disappointment.

216
00:12:10,274 --> 00:12:13,374
We don't know how to overcome
your country's Puritan heritage.

217
00:12:13,387 --> 00:12:14,165
I can learn!

218
00:12:14,276 --> 00:12:14,881
Teach me!

219
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:15,585
Good-bye.

220
00:12:15,949 --> 00:12:18,513
No, no, no, please,
don't leave.

221
00:12:19,055 --> 00:12:20,174
I'll lose face.

222
00:12:20,214 --> 00:12:25,258
In American culture, if I say
I'm throwing a party and my
guests leave, then I'm humiliated.

223
00:12:25,316 --> 00:12:28,866
And I have to prove myself
in combat against the mayor.

224
00:12:29,088 --> 00:12:30,052
I might die.

225
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:41,697
We know your story's a load of crap,
but we think you're cute. We'll stay.

226
00:12:41,728 --> 00:12:44,984
But if we are not drunk in 20 minutes,
we are leaving.

227
00:12:45,415 --> 00:12:49,575
Thank you so much for being
reasonable. Just go back in
my room and stay out of sight.

228
00:12:49,605 --> 00:12:51,283
This won't take long, I promise.

229
00:12:52,909 --> 00:12:56,255
Dude, I can't believe you admitted
you're afraid to fight the mayor.

230
00:12:56,285 --> 00:12:57,741
What are we going to
do about Mom and Dad?

231
00:12:57,771 --> 00:12:58,688
I've got it covered.

232
00:12:58,718 --> 00:12:59,238
How?

233
00:12:59,492 --> 00:13:05,176
Let's just say that since people started
getting prescription drugs in the mail,
it's opened a whole new world of possibility.

234
00:13:05,206 --> 00:13:09,648
Remember when Dad took away my
GameBoy and then he fell asleep at
work and he thought he was going to be fired?

235
00:13:09,678 --> 00:13:12,071
Tuna salad with cumin
and allergy medicine.

236
00:13:13,148 --> 00:13:15,483
Reese, do you know how
crazy and dangerous that is?

237
00:13:15,513 --> 00:13:17,151
Even you wouldn't
poison your own family.

238
00:13:17,181 --> 00:13:22,251
No? Malcolm, last month, when
you thought your watch skipped
from Wednesday to Friday...

239
00:13:23,346 --> 00:13:24,407
it wasn't the watch.

240
00:13:25,154 --> 00:13:28,376
Okay, I've got a plan
that isn't insane.

241
00:13:28,838 --> 00:13:31,138
I'll make a call to get
them out of the house.

242
00:13:32,209 --> 00:13:34,359
Oh, here comes Dad.
Just keep him occupied.

243
00:13:39,669 --> 00:13:40,969
How are the coals looking?

244
00:13:41,075 --> 00:13:41,725
Almost ready.

245
00:13:41,731 --> 00:13:43,465
Oh, okay. Let me know.

246
00:13:43,993 --> 00:13:44,996
-Dad, wait.
-What?

247
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,380
Where do babies come from?

248
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:51,038
Reese, I'm sure we've
talked about this.

249
00:13:51,068 --> 00:13:52,218
Yeah, but I'm blanking.

250
00:13:52,282 --> 00:13:53,082
Two guys, right?

251
00:13:55,169 --> 00:13:56,875
You know, we can
talk about this later.

252
00:13:56,905 --> 00:13:59,655
You better get that phone.
It sounds like it's for you.

253
00:14:09,372 --> 00:14:10,703
<i>I hate children.</i>

254
00:14:12,206 --> 00:14:14,309
Francis? Francis?

255
00:14:14,367 --> 00:14:17,736
I had another thought for you
and Piama ballroom dancing.

256
00:14:18,411 --> 00:14:22,015
Oh, that sounds great, Mom.
But you know, your advice from earlier,

257
00:14:22,022 --> 00:14:25,141
it really helped out,
so I think we're going to be cool.

258
00:14:27,418 --> 00:14:29,454
-That stupid fish?!
-<i>Malcolm!</i>

259
00:14:29,523 --> 00:14:30,123
<i>Crap!</i>

260
00:14:31,651 --> 00:14:33,517
-That stupid fish?!
-<i>Malcolm!</i>

261
00:14:33,536 --> 00:14:34,061
Crap!

262
00:14:45,387 --> 00:14:45,928
Hello?

263
00:14:49,419 --> 00:14:55,131
<b>6:42 pm
</b>

264
00:14:55,132 --> 00:14:58,213
<b>6:42 pm
THE KITCHEN</b>

265
00:15:01,505 --> 00:15:03,607
Come on. Follow me, this way.

266
00:15:04,322 --> 00:15:05,287
Movies are wrong.

267
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,521
America is not a fun country.

268
00:15:07,524 --> 00:15:12,543
The public transportation is underfunded
and you can't drink beer in the library,
and now the lights are out.

269
00:15:12,573 --> 00:15:17,473
This country's also full of lying
fathers who say you can have
cereal and then make you eat steak.

270
00:15:17,557 --> 00:15:19,127
I promise you, you'll have fun.

271
00:15:19,182 --> 00:15:21,073
Dewey, shut up and get lost!

272
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:24,641
If you understood our culture better,
there's no way you'd be here.

273
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:30,340
It's not going to work.

274
00:15:30,737 --> 00:15:33,140
Mom and Dad aren't going anywhere. We're
going to have to do this another night.

275
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:35,287
There is no other night.
They're going home tomorrow.

276
00:15:35,317 --> 00:15:36,644
But there is a blackout.

277
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:39,331
What are we supposed to do with a
bunch of Dutch girls in the dark?

278
00:15:39,361 --> 00:15:40,993
These girls are from Amsterdam.

279
00:15:41,174 --> 00:15:43,348
They don't even have a
word for virginity there.

280
00:15:43,378 --> 00:15:46,309
Is there a high-speed train available
to take us to a "juke joint"?

281
00:15:46,339 --> 00:15:48,969
We wish to experience
typical American culture.

282
00:15:48,973 --> 00:15:49,705
And you will.

283
00:15:49,723 --> 00:15:52,654
This is a very important
part of American culture.

284
00:15:52,732 --> 00:15:54,786
Which is getting the
parents out of the house.

285
00:15:54,816 --> 00:15:56,621
You know, teenage hijinks.

286
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:59,827
In Holland, parents enjoy for
children to have pleasure.

287
00:15:59,862 --> 00:16:03,770
I know, it's crazy.
And yet, we rule the world.

288
00:16:05,604 --> 00:16:10,038
Okay, Malcolm, your arrogant
American attitude has charmed us.

289
00:16:11,002 --> 00:16:12,850
-There will be alcohol?
-I promise.

290
00:16:12,978 --> 00:16:16,228
You just go and wait in our room
and we'll get it all sorted out.

291
00:16:16,834 --> 00:16:18,784
I get the easy-looking
one on the left.

292
00:16:18,971 --> 00:16:20,225
We all speak English.

293
00:16:20,297 --> 00:16:20,803
I know.

294
00:16:23,569 --> 00:16:25,269
<i>Come on, come on. Let's go.</i>

295
00:16:54,531 --> 00:16:57,431
Just because it's drugs,
doesn't mean it has to taste bad.

296
00:17:58,788 --> 00:17:59,938
<i>I hate children.</i>

297
00:18:01,035 --> 00:18:02,096
I can't believe it.

298
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:09,104
Your mother and I, well, all of us, really
are missing the greatest beef in the world
because your brother Malcolm is drunk!

299
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:10,630
He's not drunk, Dad.

300
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:14,326
-He's hiding under his bed with Dutch girls.
-Don't cover for him!

301
00:18:14,696 --> 00:18:18,880
Malcolm, you're such a big
man when you're getting
drunk to impress your friends.

302
00:18:18,893 --> 00:18:23,393
But when it's time to drive home
and take your punishment, it's
"Oh, Daddy, come save me."

303
00:18:23,571 --> 00:18:25,271
-<i>That stupid fish!</i>
-Malcolm!

304
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,407
Crap!

305
00:18:30,419 --> 00:18:31,223
You're here!

306
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:32,836
Kinda.

307
00:18:32,841 --> 00:18:35,715
You lied to me.
You're not drunk at all!

308
00:18:35,725 --> 00:18:38,150
You lied to me.
You're not getting divorced.

309
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:38,615
Sorry.

310
00:18:38,777 --> 00:18:41,542
You sold out your wife and your
marriage and got me all...

311
00:18:41,572 --> 00:18:43,500
-Excited, Mom?
-No. Upset.

312
00:18:43,509 --> 00:18:45,367
All so you could steal
your father's fish!

313
00:18:45,397 --> 00:18:48,699
You can't steal what belongs to you.
I reeled it in for five hours.

314
00:18:48,729 --> 00:18:50,958
He just swooped in at the
last moment and gaffed it.

315
00:18:50,988 --> 00:18:53,688
You said if I ever called and said I
was drunk I wouldn't get in trouble.

316
00:18:53,718 --> 00:18:55,879
That only applies if
you're actually drunk!

317
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:58,222
That was ten years ago!
Why do you even care?

318
00:18:58,232 --> 00:19:00,432
-It was between me and some guys.
-What guys?

319
00:19:00,495 --> 00:19:07,216
They come around the pool, every day at 3:00,
talking smack like all I do is hang around at the
pool all day and I never did anything with my life.

320
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:08,732
So I told 'em about the fish.

321
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:10,640
And they said they
didn't believe me!

322
00:19:10,656 --> 00:19:13,826
Man, I can't wait to see the
look on Jason Sullivan's face!

323
00:19:13,921 --> 00:19:16,275
3:00? How old are these people?

324
00:19:16,546 --> 00:19:17,546
Good point.

325
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:22,149
A 12-year-old should not be
lecturing people about how they
have or have not lived their lives!

326
00:19:22,179 --> 00:19:25,971
-You're trying to impress a 12-year-old?
-Not trying to, going to.

327
00:19:25,989 --> 00:19:28,576
I don't want this dead fish in my house.
You can have it.

328
00:19:28,606 --> 00:19:31,106
But once I help you,
you know what you have to do.

329
00:19:31,512 --> 00:19:33,010
Learn not to care what
other people think?

330
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,262
Get a job!

331
00:19:34,971 --> 00:19:37,093
Yeah, that'll show 'em.

332
00:19:38,295 --> 00:19:41,633
I am going to decide your punishment
on a full stomach, Malcolm.

333
00:19:41,827 --> 00:19:42,724
Malcolm?

334
00:19:43,086 --> 00:19:43,800
Francis?

335
00:19:43,806 --> 00:19:47,154
-You lied about being drunk?
-What are you doing with my fish?

336
00:19:47,169 --> 00:19:48,052
Dinner!

337
00:19:53,175 --> 00:19:57,718
I don't know where you get it,
the dishonesty. We are your
family, and you betray us.

338
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,782
God, this is so good, Reese.

339
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:00,419
Thanks.

340
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:06,282
Malcolm, I would like to reach into your
ear and tear out that part of your brain
that makes you do things like this!

341
00:20:06,869 --> 00:20:08,779
-Smoky.
-That's the mesquite.

342
00:20:08,808 --> 00:20:11,914
I don't even know what's
happening in my own house.

343
00:20:12,224 --> 00:20:13,613
Really good, Reese.

344
00:20:13,809 --> 00:20:16,188
Hey, thanks for your piece, Dewey.
You sure you don't want any?

345
00:20:16,218 --> 00:20:16,873
No, thanks.

346
00:20:16,993 --> 00:20:18,607
That is so nice of you, Dewey.

347
00:20:18,615 --> 00:20:20,515
At least we have one
boy we can trust.

348
00:20:36,002 --> 00:20:37,199
I taste?

349
00:20:37,393 --> 00:20:38,393
You don't want that.

350
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:41,310
Reese made this special
sleeping sauce for Mom and Dad,

351
00:20:41,699 --> 00:20:43,949
but I thought the whole
family deserved some.

352
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:54,129
A typical American dinner, no?

353
00:20:54,257 --> 00:20:55,742
A special American dinner.

354
00:20:56,015 --> 00:20:56,806
Lucky Charms?

355
00:20:57,068 --> 00:20:57,531
Danke.

356
00:20:59,792 --> 00:21:03,573
Mm, the frosted moons and stars
are both magic and also delicious.

357
00:21:04,361 --> 00:21:07,592
I can't believe they promised it to you
and then just tried to take it back.

358
00:21:07,622 --> 00:21:08,699
Forget about them.

359
00:21:08,804 --> 00:21:10,366
Let's just enjoy
our time together.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
