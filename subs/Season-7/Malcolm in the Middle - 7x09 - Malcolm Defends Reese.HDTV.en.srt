1
00:00:08,595 --> 00:00:10,736
<i>Reese, are you trying to sneak out?</i>

2
00:00:10,892 --> 00:00:14,199
No. I'm trying to get comfortable in
this crappy bed, if you don't mind.

3
00:00:14,229 --> 00:00:18,829
Fine. Then you won't mind if
I stand right out here in the
hall until I see you go to sleep.

4
00:00:27,965 --> 00:00:29,797
She can't stay awake all night.

5
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:43,350
Malcolm in the Middle
7.09 - "Malcolm Defends Reese"

00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:54,350
Synchronisation par Max & Tyno,
Script original par Raceman.

Forom.com, Life-is-Unfair.tk
& Malcolm-France.com

8
00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:15,589
Fascinating timeline, Reese.

9
00:01:15,778 --> 00:01:16,444
So let's see.

10
00:01:16,617 --> 00:01:22,462
It was the moon landing,
the War of 1812, then the
Lincoln-Kennedy shoot-out.

11
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:27,853
It's embarrassing enough having
Reese in my class this year.

12
00:01:27,883 --> 00:01:30,696
What's worse is Herkabe's made
him his personal whipping boy.

13
00:01:30,726 --> 00:01:35,802
Reese, I'm just looking through my notes
here, and it appears that that was your
20th wrong answer in a row.

14
00:01:35,832 --> 00:01:37,132
And you know what
that means, don't you?

15
00:01:37,162 --> 00:01:38,377
<i>Monkey dance!</i>

16
00:01:38,425 --> 00:01:40,721
Monkey dance! Monkey dance!

17
00:01:41,147 --> 00:01:41,961
Monkey dance?

18
00:01:41,995 --> 00:01:43,195
Your first right answer.

19
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:45,510
Well, let's not leave
your audience waiting.

20
00:01:50,721 --> 00:01:51,467
Wait, Reese.

21
00:01:51,814 --> 00:01:52,221
Stop.

22
00:01:52,633 --> 00:01:53,483
This isn't right.

23
00:01:56,824 --> 00:01:57,820
Okay, continue.

24
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:07,306
Lois, hello, it's me, Claire.

25
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:08,550
Hey, come on in.

26
00:02:09,992 --> 00:02:11,698
Hi, sweetie.

27
00:02:11,988 --> 00:02:14,159
Claire, you are a godsend.

28
00:02:14,297 --> 00:02:16,362
Thank you for taking him
on such short notice.

29
00:02:16,392 --> 00:02:17,864
Is this schedule
gonna work for you?

30
00:02:17,894 --> 00:02:20,631
Oh, good Lord, Lois.
Any schedule works for me.

31
00:02:20,848 --> 00:02:22,598
What have I got to
do with my time?

32
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:25,821
Poke around a big, empty house,
waiting for one of my kids to call?

33
00:02:25,851 --> 00:02:27,701
We both know that's
not gonna happen.

34
00:02:27,825 --> 00:02:29,885
You know, you raise them,
you put the through college,

35
00:02:29,915 --> 00:02:33,380
and loan them money to buy a house, and
suddenly, they don't need you anymore.

36
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:35,660
God forbid you should
express a need to them.

37
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:37,105
I could tell you stories...

38
00:02:37,245 --> 00:02:38,120
Bet you could.

39
00:02:38,145 --> 00:02:38,858
-Yeah.
-Well.

40
00:02:39,056 --> 00:02:42,018
-Again, thank you.
-I'm glad to do it, honestly.

41
00:02:42,338 --> 00:02:44,187
Takes my mind off my shingles.

42
00:02:44,694 --> 00:02:47,697
Good Lord, you've never felt pain
like that in all your waking days.

43
00:02:47,727 --> 00:02:49,099
It's just dreadful.

44
00:02:49,271 --> 00:02:50,689
Did I tell you about the pain?

45
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:54,064
-I think you did this morning.
-It's worse than my arthritis,
which is crippling.

46
00:02:54,094 --> 00:02:57,995
It feels like someone's stabbing you
all over with tiny, razor-sharp knives.

47
00:02:58,001 --> 00:03:00,203
Oh, pray God you
never get it, Lois.

48
00:03:00,534 --> 00:03:03,500
Oh, listen to me just going
on and on about myself.

49
00:03:03,987 --> 00:03:05,828
Wind me up and I
can talk all day.

50
00:03:07,116 --> 00:03:09,692
Well, like I said,
I have a million things to do.

51
00:03:09,694 --> 00:03:11,737
You know, so do I, so do I.

52
00:03:11,817 --> 00:03:14,677
I have laundry stacked
up just waiting for me.

53
00:03:14,681 --> 00:03:19,300
And I have so neglected my
scrapbooking that it's a scandal.
Do you scrapbook, Lois?

54
00:03:19,793 --> 00:03:22,409
They've got these really
cute kits. It's a lot of fun.

55
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:26,021
My niece Terri well, she prefers
Teresa, but she's a Terri.

56
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,750
<i>Anyway, she got me started on it.</i>

57
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:31,680
<i>Well, what else is she gonna do with
herself? She's barren, poor thing.</i>

58
00:03:31,762 --> 00:03:32,912
You're still mad at me?

59
00:03:33,178 --> 00:03:34,558
You threw at my head, Dad.

60
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:36,329
It was a brushback pitch, Dewey.

61
00:03:36,504 --> 00:03:39,541
I got to protect the plate or you're
gonna be taking me downtown all day.

62
00:03:40,841 --> 00:03:41,224
Hi.

63
00:03:41,467 --> 00:03:41,873
Hi.

64
00:03:43,543 --> 00:03:44,643
Did you do your vocab?

65
00:03:44,793 --> 00:03:46,222
Yeah. It wasn't so bad.

66
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:47,771
<i>Yeah, it was pretty easy.</i>

67
00:03:47,801 --> 00:03:48,401
<i>Yeah.</i>

68
00:03:48,674 --> 00:03:49,974
So I'll see you in school?

69
00:03:50,044 --> 00:03:50,944
Talk to you later.

70
00:03:55,339 --> 00:03:56,417
What was that about?

71
00:03:56,651 --> 00:03:57,251
That's Gina.

72
00:03:57,456 --> 00:03:58,414
She's from my class.

73
00:03:58,444 --> 00:03:59,244
Do you like her?

74
00:03:59,845 --> 00:04:00,495
I don't know.

75
00:04:01,637 --> 00:04:02,409
I guess so.

76
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,704
Well, you played it cool, son.

77
00:04:07,449 --> 00:04:08,761
Maybe too cool.

78
00:04:10,665 --> 00:04:12,009
Feel this shoulder, Lois.

79
00:04:12,215 --> 00:04:14,125
It's like a sack of
burning jelly in there.

80
00:04:14,155 --> 00:04:15,555
Go ahead, give it a squeeze.

81
00:04:16,108 --> 00:04:18,258
It is spongier than
the thing on your back.

82
00:04:19,502 --> 00:04:20,474
Hal, your home.

83
00:04:20,691 --> 00:04:21,143
Hi, honey.

84
00:04:21,173 --> 00:04:21,691
Hi, Hal.

85
00:04:22,226 --> 00:04:22,725
Hello.

86
00:04:22,822 --> 00:04:24,713
This is Claire,
Jamie's new babysitter.

87
00:04:24,743 --> 00:04:26,411
I just moved into the
Franklin's old house.

88
00:04:26,441 --> 00:04:29,191
-Hey, that's a nice place.
-It is, it is on the outside.

89
00:04:29,434 --> 00:04:31,997
Of course it's full of dry rot.
I must have called the guy 50 times...

90
00:04:32,027 --> 00:04:33,148
Claire was just leaving.

91
00:04:33,178 --> 00:04:35,263
Well, heck, why don't you
stay and have dinner with us?

92
00:04:35,293 --> 00:04:36,065
<i>No, no.</i>

93
00:04:36,228 --> 00:04:36,843
Got to run.

94
00:04:39,823 --> 00:04:43,223
I hope it wasn't too much trouble
cooking for my special diet, Lois.

95
00:04:43,264 --> 00:04:47,749
It's been a bit of an adjustment
after the doctors took
out six feet of my colon.

96
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:50,885
You know what I call it now?

97
00:04:51,311 --> 00:04:52,350
My semicolon.

98
00:04:52,362 --> 00:04:53,800
My semicolon!

99
00:04:55,453 --> 00:04:57,317
Claire, I really have
to go to sleep now.

100
00:04:57,347 --> 00:04:58,951
Oh, God, I wish I could sleep.

101
00:04:59,386 --> 00:05:04,318
I toss and turn all night.
I start off on my stomach,
then I flip over to my back.

102
00:05:04,407 --> 00:05:05,284
No, wait, no.

103
00:05:05,535 --> 00:05:08,214
I start on my back,
I flip over to my stomach...

104
00:05:09,149 --> 00:05:10,133
I don't know.

105
00:05:10,614 --> 00:05:11,772
I can't think any more.

106
00:05:12,757 --> 00:05:13,477
Is it...

107
00:05:14,544 --> 00:05:15,316
"C"?

108
00:05:15,642 --> 00:05:17,548
I'm sorry, Reese.
That's incorrect.

109
00:05:17,844 --> 00:05:18,274
Hammy?

110
00:05:19,647 --> 00:05:20,349
Yes!

111
00:05:20,709 --> 00:05:22,570
Fort Ticonderoga is correct.

112
00:05:22,638 --> 00:05:26,582
I was looking for a close race,
but, Hammy, you've really run
away with this thing.

113
00:05:26,612 --> 00:05:34,180
I'm sorry, that's all the time we have today,
but join us again tomorrow for another exciting
installment of... "What Is Dumber Than Reese?"

114
00:05:42,606 --> 00:05:45,010
You're nothing but a bully
and a sadist, you know that?!

115
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:48,390
How could you possibly take any
satisfaction in humiliating Reese?!

116
00:05:48,434 --> 00:05:49,256
It's Reese!

117
00:05:49,609 --> 00:05:50,959
You have to stop this, now!

118
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:53,170
Well, well, well, that
took you long enough.

119
00:05:53,368 --> 00:05:53,769
What?

120
00:05:53,866 --> 00:05:56,012
I've been trying to get your
attention since the semester began.

121
00:05:56,042 --> 00:06:00,289
I'm surprised you didn't say something
last week, when Reese was curled up
in a fetal ball under my desk.

122
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,569
What do you want from me?

123
00:06:02,468 --> 00:06:03,118
Come with me.

124
00:06:05,049 --> 00:06:06,385
I won it my senior year.

125
00:06:08,174 --> 00:06:09,952
-Football trophy?
-Behind that.

126
00:06:11,142 --> 00:06:13,145
-The soccer trophy?
-Behind that.

127
00:06:14,515 --> 00:06:18,065
-There's just a bunch of crappy ribbons.
-Behind the spelling bee award.

128
00:06:18,433 --> 00:06:20,261
That thing that looks like it
broke off that other trophy?

129
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:25,730
I cannot be responsible for the myopic
value this sports-obsessed administration
places on academic achievement.

130
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:31,410
But that little plaque represents the
highest GPA in the history of the school,
and it is mine, Malcolm, all mine.

131
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,067
So what?

132
00:06:32,305 --> 00:06:32,973
So wha...

133
00:06:33,651 --> 00:06:35,789
I had to work hard
for that plaque.

134
00:06:35,949 --> 00:06:40,022
I had to score higher than Edna Fornby,
who'd held the title for 38 years.

135
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:43,823
A towering intellect, blind since birth,
went on to be a Rhodes scholar.

136
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:45,709
Really classy lady.

137
00:06:46,023 --> 00:06:48,991
Cried like a baby when
I took it from her.

138
00:06:50,608 --> 00:06:51,613
What a night.

139
00:06:52,062 --> 00:06:54,385
And now, you are on
track to take it from me.

140
00:06:54,717 --> 00:06:55,556
What's your point?

141
00:06:55,586 --> 00:06:56,786
I can't let that happen.

142
00:06:57,122 --> 00:07:02,425
And if you don't want to see
me destroy your brother every
day for the rest of the year...

143
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:04,117
you won't let it happen.

144
00:07:04,154 --> 00:07:06,284
-Are you serious?
-As a heart attack.

145
00:07:07,154 --> 00:07:09,035
Now, I can't just
give you a "B."

146
00:07:09,158 --> 00:07:10,158
People are watching.

147
00:07:10,403 --> 00:07:12,695
For some reason,
I rub people the wrong way.

148
00:07:12,884 --> 00:07:15,724
But that doesn't stop you from
tanking the course on your own.

149
00:07:15,754 --> 00:07:17,504
Are you really that
shallow and petty?

150
00:07:17,534 --> 00:07:19,345
You have no idea.

151
00:07:20,431 --> 00:07:23,380
So, you know, take
a few days, think it over.

152
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:26,840
It'll give me more time to think
up some challenges for Reese.

153
00:07:27,176 --> 00:07:30,076
Do you think hot coals would
set off the sprinkler system?

154
00:07:32,527 --> 00:07:34,414
Lois, I was just gonna
bring Jamie home.

155
00:07:34,444 --> 00:07:35,874
Thought I'd save you the trip.

156
00:07:35,904 --> 00:07:36,648
<i>Come on, Jamie.</i>

157
00:07:36,678 --> 00:07:38,574
Thanks, Claire.
See you tomorrow.

158
00:07:38,578 --> 00:07:39,238
Won't you come in?

159
00:07:39,268 --> 00:07:41,518
I'd love to, but I have
such a busy schedule.

160
00:07:41,543 --> 00:07:42,510
I understand.

161
00:07:45,226 --> 00:07:46,500
Busy, busy, busy.

162
00:07:46,511 --> 00:07:48,273
No one has any time anymore.

163
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,818
Oh, my goodness, I walked
you all the way home.

164
00:07:51,071 --> 00:07:53,971
You get out of those work clothes,
and I'll make some tea.

165
00:07:57,577 --> 00:07:59,618
Hey, Dewey, look at this.

166
00:08:01,058 --> 00:08:03,708
I got the microwave to work
without closing the door.

167
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:04,910
That's great, Dad.

168
00:08:06,008 --> 00:08:08,876
So, did you, uh...
talk to Gina?

169
00:08:08,982 --> 00:08:09,333
No.

170
00:08:10,181 --> 00:08:10,605
Oh.

171
00:08:11,903 --> 00:08:14,753
It's just that you said you
would talk to her later, and,

172
00:08:15,384 --> 00:08:17,680
I mean, if I remember,
she remembers.

173
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:18,887
Maybe I'll talk
to her tomorrow.

174
00:08:18,917 --> 00:08:19,631
Tomorrow?

175
00:08:20,646 --> 00:08:23,421
Gee, Dewey, if I'm Gina,
I don't know what's going on.

176
00:08:23,499 --> 00:08:24,562
It's no big deal, Dad.

177
00:08:24,592 --> 00:08:25,123
Dewey!

178
00:08:27,627 --> 00:08:28,302
Come here.

179
00:08:28,822 --> 00:08:32,897
Look... I know it's not easy
figuring this stuff out.

180
00:08:32,901 --> 00:08:37,601
You want to be with her, but
you just don't know what to say,
and you feel like such a doofus.

181
00:08:37,903 --> 00:08:38,495
I know.

182
00:08:38,496 --> 00:08:39,822
So here's what you're gonna do.

183
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:42,452
You're gonna go in the house
right now and call her.

184
00:08:42,901 --> 00:08:43,489
Right now?

185
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:47,828
Or you could wait till you're
old, toothless, alone, living
in a welfare hotel,

186
00:08:48,169 --> 00:08:51,810
hoping the couple screaming next door
invites you over to dinner sometime.

187
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,626
It's up to you.

188
00:08:54,872 --> 00:08:56,130
It's called leaky gut.

189
00:08:58,296 --> 00:08:59,120
Hal.

190
00:08:59,552 --> 00:09:01,052
Why don't we go out to dinner?

191
00:09:01,109 --> 00:09:02,155
Doesn't that sound good?

192
00:09:02,185 --> 00:09:03,689
Well, I'm helping Dewey
with a project, hon.

193
00:09:03,719 --> 00:09:05,169
Why don't you go with Claire?

194
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:07,925
When it's quiet,
you can hear it dripping.

195
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:11,755
Hear that?

196
00:09:13,643 --> 00:09:14,368
You ready?

197
00:09:14,423 --> 00:09:14,979
No, wait.

198
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:16,253
I need more time.

199
00:09:16,283 --> 00:09:18,148
Believe me,
I have been through it.

200
00:09:18,213 --> 00:09:21,111
You just want to run away,
hide under the covers and cry.

201
00:09:21,118 --> 00:09:22,018
But you know what?

202
00:09:22,492 --> 00:09:24,162
That's how you
know you're a man.

203
00:09:28,798 --> 00:09:29,448
<i>Hello?</i>

204
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:35,529
<i>Hello?</i>

205
00:09:37,385 --> 00:09:38,002
Hello.

206
00:09:38,304 --> 00:09:40,451
Gina. Hi, this is Dewey's dad.

207
00:09:42,114 --> 00:09:46,069
He just called to say that
he was thinking of you.

208
00:09:46,588 --> 00:09:48,588
Oh, and he thinks that
homework is dumb.

209
00:09:49,699 --> 00:09:50,339
Really?

210
00:09:50,435 --> 00:09:52,099
She thinks homework is dumb, too.

211
00:10:02,504 --> 00:10:03,117
Reese.

212
00:10:03,461 --> 00:10:07,011
I think it's terrible what Herkabe's
been putting you through in class.

213
00:10:07,131 --> 00:10:09,631
I really feel bad about
the way he's treating you.

214
00:10:10,516 --> 00:10:12,366
I'll bet I could make
you feel worse!

215
00:10:14,732 --> 00:10:15,610
Thought it over.

216
00:10:16,835 --> 00:10:17,714
What happened to your lip?

217
00:10:17,744 --> 00:10:18,448
Reese.

218
00:10:18,966 --> 00:10:20,154
He's a troubled young man.

219
00:10:20,184 --> 00:10:23,678
God knows I've tried my best with him,
but you can't let that fact poison...

220
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:24,979
Relax, I'm gonna do it.

221
00:10:25,423 --> 00:10:25,873
You will?

222
00:10:25,912 --> 00:10:28,395
Reese can't help who he is.
And you can't help being a jerk.

223
00:10:28,425 --> 00:10:30,795
I'm the only one who has
a choice over what I do.

224
00:10:30,825 --> 00:10:35,098
So, yeah, I'll take your sick
little deal so you can keep your
pathetic, meaningless plaque.

225
00:10:35,128 --> 00:10:36,144
Thank you, Malcolm.

226
00:10:36,172 --> 00:10:40,105
I know that you think that this
compromised victory will taste
like ashes in my mouth,

227
00:10:40,135 --> 00:10:43,037
but there's something
I learned a long time ago.

228
00:10:44,542 --> 00:10:45,892
Ashes don't taste that bad.

229
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:50,709
Okay, class, we'll start this
morning with an oral quiz.

230
00:10:51,078 --> 00:10:56,685
Who was the victor in the disputed
presidential election of 1896.

231
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:57,607
Um...

232
00:11:01,171 --> 00:11:01,672
Malcolm?

233
00:11:03,793 --> 00:11:04,843
Surely you know this.

234
00:11:07,435 --> 00:11:08,013
Tilden.

235
00:11:08,482 --> 00:11:09,108
What was that?

236
00:11:09,138 --> 00:11:09,736
Tilden!

237
00:11:11,385 --> 00:11:12,240
That's incorrect.

238
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:16,080
What an idiot!

239
00:11:16,677 --> 00:11:18,675
Monkey dance! Monkey dance!

240
00:11:18,712 --> 00:11:19,782
<i>Monkey dance!</i>

241
00:11:19,814 --> 00:11:20,735
<i>Monkey dance!</i>

242
00:11:20,765 --> 00:11:22,684
<i>Monkey dance!
Monkey dance!</i>

243
00:11:28,746 --> 00:11:29,940
We have a problem.

244
00:11:30,133 --> 00:11:30,462
What?

245
00:11:30,698 --> 00:11:34,648
Some wavy-haired blond boy was chatting
up Gina at the bike racks after school.

246
00:11:35,202 --> 00:11:36,253
Don't you work, Dad?

247
00:11:36,266 --> 00:11:39,166
Never mind that. The point is,
you should have been there.

248
00:11:39,421 --> 00:11:40,621
It was probably Stephan.

249
00:11:40,837 --> 00:11:41,587
He's no threat.

250
00:11:41,649 --> 00:11:42,904
I saw him, Dewey.

251
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:44,079
He's an Adonis!

252
00:11:44,406 --> 00:11:47,406
Okay, what you need here is
some sort of romantic gesture.

253
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:48,587
What do you mean?

254
00:11:48,691 --> 00:11:52,463
Just off the top of my head,
you could send her a nice
box of expensive chocolates.

255
00:11:52,493 --> 00:11:53,226
I'm not sure.

256
00:11:53,251 --> 00:11:54,615
Too late. You already did.

257
00:11:54,733 --> 00:11:58,306
You just dropped off a big
box on her front doorstep,
rang the bell and ran like hell.

258
00:11:58,336 --> 00:12:00,436
You also trampled some
of her rose bushes.

259
00:12:00,475 --> 00:12:01,625
Congratulations, son.

260
00:12:02,232 --> 00:12:03,182
You're in the game.

261
00:12:05,062 --> 00:12:09,226
Hal, I have to do something about
Claire. She is driving me crazy.

262
00:12:10,444 --> 00:12:14,020
Oh, Hal, that is so sweet.

263
00:12:14,546 --> 00:12:15,396
It's not for you.

264
00:12:18,228 --> 00:12:19,939
Didn't you learn your
lesson with Francis?

265
00:12:19,969 --> 00:12:22,087
That Jenny Thompson
was a stuck-up snot.

266
00:12:22,122 --> 00:12:23,600
Hal, I have bigger problems.

267
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:25,832
I cannot stand that woman.

268
00:12:26,433 --> 00:12:30,413
Which normally isn't an
issue, except, I can't afford
to tell her off and lose her.

269
00:12:30,443 --> 00:12:34,081
She's good with Jamie, she's right down
the street, she's incredibly cheap.

270
00:12:34,111 --> 00:12:37,537
She'd be perfect if she weren't
the most annoying person
on the face of the planet.

271
00:12:37,567 --> 00:12:40,973
I feel like the top of my head
is going to explode if I hear
her say another word.

272
00:12:41,003 --> 00:12:42,115
What rhymes with dreamy?

273
00:12:42,145 --> 00:12:43,681
Hal, for God's sake.

274
00:12:44,206 --> 00:12:45,884
I heard what you said, Lois.

275
00:12:46,034 --> 00:12:48,521
Look, you just have to
completely disengage with her.

276
00:12:48,551 --> 00:12:54,161
Take Jamie when she drops him off,
nod pleasantly, you can even smile,
and then, slam the door in her face.

277
00:12:54,176 --> 00:12:55,826
And don't beat
yourself up over it.

278
00:12:55,856 --> 00:12:57,518
Some people are just crazy.

279
00:12:58,985 --> 00:13:00,385
Do we have any fun stickers?

280
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,622
B-minus! Ha!

281
00:13:09,718 --> 00:13:10,873
I did better than you.

282
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:12,160
For the first time...

283
00:13:13,286 --> 00:13:13,720
Wait.

284
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:16,360
A, B, C, D...

285
00:13:17,016 --> 00:13:17,768
Never mind.

286
00:13:19,729 --> 00:13:24,832
Buck up, Malcolm. Only 12 more weeks,
and then I'll back off and let you pick
the course you want to tank.

287
00:13:24,862 --> 00:13:26,699
Hey, we're not in your stupid
class anymore, all right?

288
00:13:26,729 --> 00:13:27,693
Will you just leave me alone?

289
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:30,539
Oh, a sullen rebuke.
What a bonus.

290
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:34,484
You know, I might make them get me a
bigger plaque when I beat you, Malcolm.

291
00:13:35,328 --> 00:13:37,880
Ugh! How can they
let it get so dingy?

292
00:13:38,149 --> 00:13:38,897
Hey, Slick!

293
00:13:39,234 --> 00:13:44,234
Instead of pushing dust around
over there, why don't you polish
up these trophies? It's disgraceful.

294
00:13:44,952 --> 00:13:47,752
You know, I'll admit,
it wasn't easy beating old Fornby.

295
00:13:47,757 --> 00:13:51,244
Of course she had the added
advantage of being blind and
club-footed, no distractions,

296
00:13:51,274 --> 00:13:53,874
but still, I had to bust my
hump that last semester.

297
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:57,706
Did you know, instead of seventh
period gym, I created my own AP class?

298
00:13:57,791 --> 00:14:00,997
While those Cro-Magnons were
chasing balls and sweating like swine,

299
00:14:01,027 --> 00:14:05,736
I was sitting in an air-conditioned
room with my tie unloosed,
discussing Renaissance poetry.

300
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:07,237
You wore a suit to school?

301
00:14:07,247 --> 00:14:08,567
And a silk handkerchief.

302
00:14:08,825 --> 00:14:12,162
They hated me because
I made them look ridiculous.

303
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:17,498
Okay, Dewey, you set the
table with the box of candy.

304
00:14:17,809 --> 00:14:19,680
Now it's time to
reap your reward.

305
00:14:20,073 --> 00:14:22,816
She's not going to feel like
I'm trying to buy her, is she?

306
00:14:22,846 --> 00:14:25,546
Let me teach you a valuable
lesson about women, Dewey.

307
00:14:25,873 --> 00:14:27,963
They think they deserve
everything you give them.

308
00:14:27,993 --> 00:14:30,043
They all like to think
they're special...

309
00:14:30,065 --> 00:14:31,365
even the ones that aren't.

310
00:14:31,548 --> 00:14:32,140
Now go.

311
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:36,695
You can do it, Son!

312
00:14:40,996 --> 00:14:41,401
Yes?

313
00:14:44,168 --> 00:14:45,326
Is Gina home?

314
00:14:45,475 --> 00:14:47,428
Are you the kid that
sent her that candy?

315
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:49,659
Um... maybe.

316
00:14:49,934 --> 00:14:51,834
Don't you know she's
allergic to nuts?

317
00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:56,726
Oh, God.

318
00:15:02,815 --> 00:15:03,886
Hello, Lois.

319
00:15:04,007 --> 00:15:05,242
Hi, sweetie.

320
00:15:05,627 --> 00:15:07,363
I made you a snack
in the kitchen.

321
00:15:07,376 --> 00:15:08,748
What a day.

322
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:14,837
Jamie was fine, but I got that
horrible ringing in my ear. It was
just dreadful. Do you ever get that?

323
00:15:15,172 --> 00:15:16,872
Well, you're blessed if you don't.

324
00:15:17,198 --> 00:15:20,196
I never noticed those cushions
before. They're darling.

325
00:15:20,415 --> 00:15:23,106
What did you pay for them? They look
so comfortable. Mind if I try 'em out?

326
00:15:23,136 --> 00:15:24,354
I'd like you to go now, Claire.

327
00:15:24,384 --> 00:15:26,639
Oh, good, because I have
a ton of things to do.

328
00:15:26,669 --> 00:15:29,099
You know how it is, though,
something always comes up.

329
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:31,979
What I would like is for you
to be in your own house now.

330
00:15:32,096 --> 00:15:33,071
Boy, so would I.

331
00:15:33,243 --> 00:15:36,636
I really have to clean my bathroom
tile grout. It's disgusting.

332
00:15:36,663 --> 00:15:39,814
Get your fat butt
out of my house!

333
00:15:41,804 --> 00:15:44,987
You're so funny. Although,
I could lose a little weight here...

334
00:15:45,019 --> 00:15:45,691
Get out!

335
00:15:45,747 --> 00:15:46,787
<i>Get out! Get out!</i>

336
00:15:46,817 --> 00:15:47,873
Get out! Get out!

337
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:49,841
Get out!

338
00:15:50,447 --> 00:15:52,276
Wow. Where did that come from?

339
00:15:52,314 --> 00:15:56,556
I have put up with this this
long because I needed you
for Jamie, but I've had it, lady.

340
00:15:56,586 --> 00:16:00,664
I'll send you a check for the
money I owe you, and after that,
I never want to see your face again.

341
00:16:00,694 --> 00:16:01,444
Well, now, I...

342
00:16:10,249 --> 00:16:16,199
Okay, I'm glad we finally got all that
out in the open, 'cause now that we know
we have issues, we can talk about them.

343
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:23,454
You can't do this. Just because
I missed one stupid gym class!

344
00:16:27,474 --> 00:16:30,461
It is a dark day
for North High,

345
00:16:30,715 --> 00:16:37,872
but given recent information that has
come to our attention regarding the
previous GPA record holder and his failure

346
00:16:37,888 --> 00:16:41,213
to meet the physical education
requirement, I have no choice.

347
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:43,128
I take no pleasure...

348
00:16:44,048 --> 00:16:48,763
in the pain this unfortunate incident
has caused, but rules are rules.

349
00:16:49,624 --> 00:16:55,517
So, I am directing that this
plaque be returned to Edna Fornby,

350
00:16:55,652 --> 00:16:58,912
who though blind and crippled,
managed to pass gym.

351
00:17:02,096 --> 00:17:03,427
Tough break, Mr. Herkabe.

352
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:05,311
I know it was you, Malcolm.

353
00:17:05,341 --> 00:17:07,368
And I wouldn't be so quick
to gloat. I'm not defeated yet.

354
00:17:07,398 --> 00:17:10,072
I'm like Napoleon at
St. Helena, plotting my return.

355
00:17:10,255 --> 00:17:10,997
You mean Elba.

356
00:17:11,142 --> 00:17:12,113
He died on St. Helena.

357
00:17:12,143 --> 00:17:12,743
Oh, shut up!

358
00:17:13,544 --> 00:17:16,544
I have to call Mother before
she hears it from someone else.

359
00:17:18,532 --> 00:17:19,573
Hey, honey.

360
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,837
Hal, it's terrible.

361
00:17:22,933 --> 00:17:24,171
Oh, what happened?

362
00:17:24,557 --> 00:17:25,463
Claire died.

363
00:17:26,449 --> 00:17:27,047
What?

364
00:17:27,638 --> 00:17:28,788
Her sister just called.

365
00:17:28,863 --> 00:17:30,663
I guess no one really
saw it coming.

366
00:17:31,171 --> 00:17:32,444
I feel so bad.

367
00:17:34,855 --> 00:17:36,005
Are you baking cookies?

368
00:17:36,311 --> 00:17:37,282
Snickerdoodles.

369
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:40,987
Boy, life is so precarious, isn't it?

370
00:17:41,565 --> 00:17:44,716
You know, just yesterday, she
was sitting right here, and then...

371
00:17:44,746 --> 00:17:46,596
Hal, you know what
I just thought of?

372
00:17:46,922 --> 00:17:50,149
We never go dancing.
Why don't we go dancing tonight?

373
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:51,582
Doesn't that sound like fun?

374
00:17:52,227 --> 00:17:53,381
Yeah, sure.

375
00:17:54,328 --> 00:17:55,039
I guess.

376
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,806
Excuse me, honey.

377
00:18:03,369 --> 00:18:03,967
You okay?

378
00:18:05,631 --> 00:18:06,276
Oh...

379
00:18:12,263 --> 00:18:13,713
You know, I've been thinking.

380
00:18:13,877 --> 00:18:15,980
Maybe she's not the
right girl for you.

381
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:18,768
She sure has made
this hard on us.

382
00:18:18,778 --> 00:18:20,221
There's no "us," Dad.

383
00:18:20,391 --> 00:18:21,200
It's you.

384
00:18:22,053 --> 00:18:24,471
Every idea you have
about girls is wrong.

385
00:18:25,302 --> 00:18:26,499
How was I ever born?

386
00:18:26,533 --> 00:18:30,638
Well, by that time, your
mother was pretty much
stuck in the relationship, and...

387
00:18:31,087 --> 00:18:32,029
Thanks a lot, Dad.

388
00:18:32,245 --> 00:18:33,171
I liked Gina.

389
00:18:33,934 --> 00:18:34,755
I really did.

390
00:18:35,275 --> 00:18:37,511
I'm sorry, Dewey.
I feel terrible.

391
00:18:37,998 --> 00:18:39,162
Maybe there's some
way I can help you...

392
00:18:39,192 --> 00:18:40,748
-No!
-Okay, right.

393
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:42,846
I will stay out of it.

394
00:18:43,766 --> 00:18:45,144
I can make this right.

395
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:46,894
I have better candy.

396
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:49,117
You'll like this candy.

397
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:50,590
<i>It's really good.</i>

398
00:18:51,128 --> 00:18:52,578
Come on, just hop in the car.

399
00:18:54,029 --> 00:18:55,956
Come on, give me a break.

400
00:18:56,513 --> 00:18:58,384
Don't you remember
your first love?

401
00:19:04,098 --> 00:19:04,922
What are you doing here?

402
00:19:04,952 --> 00:19:09,104
Reclaiming what is rightfully mine.
Once I complete this course, they'll
be forced to reinstate me.

403
00:19:09,134 --> 00:19:11,178
You can't take a
class 20 years later.

404
00:19:11,194 --> 00:19:12,871
Who is being petty,
now, Malcolm?

405
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:17,791
No, no, no. You will soon discover
what my cable guy learned the hard
way you can't defeat Lionel Herkabe.

406
00:19:17,821 --> 00:19:18,787
You see, Malcolm...

407
00:19:21,373 --> 00:19:22,417
Hey, Mr. Herkabe.

408
00:19:23,009 --> 00:19:24,002
How do you like dodge ball?

409
00:19:24,032 --> 00:19:25,582
Oh, no, wait, wait, wait, wait!

410
00:19:26,822 --> 00:19:30,537
You are just making yourself
look weak and foolish!

411
00:19:30,574 --> 00:19:33,174
I might stop hitting you if
you dance like a monkey.

412
00:19:33,763 --> 00:19:34,264
Like...

413
00:19:35,586 --> 00:19:36,396
like this?

414
00:19:36,763 --> 00:19:38,383
You call that a monkey dance?

415
00:19:44,382 --> 00:19:46,282
Some things you don't
do for trophies.

416
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:49,665
You treasure them here
where it counts the most.

417
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:51,155
<i>You think that hurt?</i>

418
00:19:51,185 --> 00:19:52,385
<i>That didn't hurt.</i>

419
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:54,793
<i>Oh, God, make it stop!</i>

420
00:19:55,818 --> 00:19:57,336
No one can take that away.

421
00:20:10,848 --> 00:20:11,473
Hi.

422
00:20:11,866 --> 00:20:12,496
Hi.

423
00:20:16,849 --> 00:20:18,146
Your dad's really weird.

424
00:20:18,956 --> 00:20:20,538
You have no idea.

425
00:20:21,847 --> 00:20:23,847
You want to eat lunch
together tomorrow?

426
00:20:24,342 --> 00:20:24,784
Okay.

427
00:20:26,395 --> 00:20:26,800
Bye.

428
00:20:27,165 --> 00:20:27,669
Bye.

429
00:20:31,785 --> 00:20:33,039
Sorry to bother you.

430
00:20:33,393 --> 00:20:35,091
I'm Claire's sister, Donna.

431
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:37,084
Oh, hi. Hi.

432
00:20:37,312 --> 00:20:37,872
Come on in.

433
00:20:37,927 --> 00:20:39,685
I don't want to impose.

434
00:20:39,724 --> 00:20:42,852
I just want to thank you for
being so nice to my sister.

435
00:20:42,934 --> 00:20:44,190
She often spoke of you.

436
00:20:44,205 --> 00:20:46,202
Oh. Well, you know,
I thought the world of her.

437
00:20:46,232 --> 00:20:47,390
Come on now, Lois.

438
00:20:47,544 --> 00:20:51,798
I think we both know that
Claire required a certain
amount of patience. Am I right?

439
00:20:54,392 --> 00:20:57,181
Anyway, you wouldn't believe
the flight I took coming here.

440
00:20:57,211 --> 00:21:01,916
First, they grounded the plane, which,
you know, you think, better they do that
than trying to fly it with something wrong.

441
00:21:01,946 --> 00:21:04,444
Then they said they're going to
fix it, and I'm thinking, oh!

442
00:21:04,474 --> 00:21:07,634
You know, Donna, I'm sorry,
but you happened to catch
me at a really busy time.

443
00:21:07,664 --> 00:21:10,869
Oh, you think you're busy,
try planning a funeral.

444
00:21:10,872 --> 00:21:12,000
Not that I'm complaining...

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
