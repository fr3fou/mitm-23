1
00:00:00,637 --> 00:00:01,331
Theven...

2
00:00:01,929 --> 00:00:02,605
<i>Heigth...</i>

3
00:00:03,068 --> 00:00:03,974
<i>Nine...</i>

4
00:00:04,322 --> 00:00:07,279
Yeth, I thtill have
the record, thucker!

5
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:15,180
Malcolm in the Middle
7.18 - "Bomb Shelter"

6
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:26,180
Synchronisation par Max & Tyno,
Script original par Raceman.

7
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:37,180
Forom.com, Life-is-Unfair.tk
& Malcolm-France.com

8
00:00:42,093 --> 00:00:45,727
I swear this mall gets more
beautiful every time we come.

9
00:00:45,821 --> 00:00:47,561
They have really
made some changes.

10
00:00:47,792 --> 00:00:49,738
They're used to be
a Banana Republic over there.

11
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:51,102
Now it's over there.

12
00:00:51,244 --> 00:00:53,389
Can we please just get my
underwear and get out of here?

13
00:00:53,391 --> 00:00:55,660
Malcolm, you know it's hard
to buy underwear for you.

14
00:00:55,674 --> 00:00:57,728
You have your father's irregular crotch.

15
00:00:57,832 --> 00:00:59,160
<i>Nothing to be ashamed of, son.</i>

16
00:00:59,167 --> 00:01:01,915
<i>If a woman really loves you,
it won't botherher a bit.</i>

17
00:01:06,307 --> 00:01:07,310
Will you look at that?

18
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:10,387
They turned a Soap Town
into a Soap And Such.

19
00:01:15,383 --> 00:01:17,214
Hi. Are you here to take class?

20
00:01:17,816 --> 00:01:20,691
Yes, that's why I came
in here, to take class.

21
00:01:21,984 --> 00:01:23,026
It's dancing, right?

22
00:01:23,123 --> 00:01:25,287
Yes. Just sign up at the counter.

23
00:01:29,334 --> 00:01:30,222
So, you're the new guy.

24
00:01:30,264 --> 00:01:32,210
What? Oh, yeah, hi.

25
00:01:33,063 --> 00:01:33,587
It's all right.

26
00:01:33,865 --> 00:01:35,273
I don't mind a little competition,

27
00:01:36,083 --> 00:01:38,167
but just so you know
what you're up against.

28
00:01:50,722 --> 00:01:55,159
So the person who keeps his or her
hand on the vehicle the longest

29
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:59,181
is going to drive out of here
in this brand-new truck!

30
00:01:59,837 --> 00:02:01,516
Oh, Hal, look at that truck.

31
00:02:01,832 --> 00:02:03,969
Can you imagine if we could
finally get rid of the van?

32
00:02:03,979 --> 00:02:07,311
That piece of junk's costing us a hundred
bucks a month in duct tape alone.

33
00:02:07,501 --> 00:02:09,868
All right, the contest is going
to begin in ten seconds.

34
00:02:10,225 --> 00:02:12,674
<i>If all the contestants are
ready, here we go.</i>

35
00:02:12,964 --> 00:02:19,389
<i>In seven, six, five,
four, three, two, one.</i>

36
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:20,260
And we're off!

37
00:02:20,494 --> 00:02:22,982
I can't believe we never entered
one of these contests before.

38
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:24,795
It's going to be
a long ride, honey.

39
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:27,332
We got our first loser.

40
00:02:27,359 --> 00:02:28,236
Ha! Idiot!

41
00:02:28,251 --> 00:02:29,036
Number two.

42
00:02:29,044 --> 00:02:30,512
Ha! Damn it all to hell!

43
00:02:36,295 --> 00:02:38,340
Come on, pal, here
we go, here we go.

44
00:02:38,582 --> 00:02:39,276
There we go.

45
00:02:42,195 --> 00:02:42,986
Oh, geez.

46
00:02:46,813 --> 00:02:47,878
No, no, no, Jamie!

47
00:02:47,888 --> 00:02:50,343
You have to stay in your chair
until breakfast is ready, okay?

48
00:02:50,352 --> 00:02:52,520
Listen, your mommy's going
to be home in a couple days,

49
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:54,200
just as soon as she wins that truck.

50
00:02:54,493 --> 00:02:55,873
And then everything
will be back to normal.

51
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:57,503
Oh, eggs.

52
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:15,090
Hello!

53
00:03:15,311 --> 00:03:17,049
Oh, hi, Hal, how's it going?

54
00:03:17,435 --> 00:03:18,996
Oh, uh, everything is...

55
00:03:19,233 --> 00:03:20,191
everything's great, honey.

56
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,525
Oh, good. Listen, I was thinking
this might be the perfect time for
you to get to your "To Do" board.

57
00:03:28,872 --> 00:03:32,658
Well, um, you know, I am not
sure that I'm going to be able to...

58
00:03:32,663 --> 00:03:35,292
Hal, I'm making this sacrifice
for the whole family.

59
00:03:35,295 --> 00:03:37,591
I think the least you can do is
catch up on some housework.

60
00:03:37,593 --> 00:03:40,215
Okay, okay, I'll talk to you later.

61
00:03:40,707 --> 00:03:41,445
Oh, geez.

62
00:03:45,146 --> 00:03:46,714
DO TO-DO LIST

63
00:03:48,137 --> 00:03:48,986
What was that?

64
00:03:49,013 --> 00:03:49,920
<i>Nothing!</i>

65
00:03:50,733 --> 00:03:55,046
Oh, my God, Dad's middle
management trophy... The Middie.

66
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:58,040
We have no choice but to
confess and take the punishment.

67
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:02,362
You're a good brother.

68
00:04:11,982 --> 00:04:13,660
Are you sure you've
never danced before?

69
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:14,965
No, never.

70
00:04:25,693 --> 00:04:27,262
You really have a gift.

71
00:04:30,661 --> 00:04:31,375
She's right.

72
00:04:31,603 --> 00:04:34,967
Turns out, I'm naturally talented
at science and dancing...

73
00:04:35,587 --> 00:04:37,712
two things that are
guaranteed to get you beat up.

74
00:04:47,272 --> 00:04:48,507
All right, partner up.

75
00:04:50,356 --> 00:04:52,581
You know, our dance
competition's coming up next week.

76
00:04:52,589 --> 00:04:54,724
You can choose any girl in
the class to be your partner.

77
00:04:55,406 --> 00:04:56,969
Really? Any girl?

78
00:04:59,421 --> 00:05:02,285
You and Danielle would
be a dream together.

79
00:05:03,245 --> 00:05:03,766
Who?

80
00:05:09,869 --> 00:05:11,567
I think I need a little
time to think about it.

81
00:05:19,584 --> 00:05:20,954
Say hi to Angela for me.

82
00:05:25,703 --> 00:05:26,780
So who's Angela?

83
00:05:27,106 --> 00:05:28,163
She's my best friend.

84
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:29,240
He's helping her move.

85
00:05:30,197 --> 00:05:31,225
-Huh.
-What?

86
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:35,326
No, I am not worried
about him and Angela.

87
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:36,007
Good for you.

88
00:05:37,126 --> 00:05:39,214
I actually met my husband
when he helped me move.

89
00:05:39,684 --> 00:05:42,080
Boy, there's nothing sexier than
a man coming to the rescue.

90
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:47,139
The two of you lug that mattress
up the stairs, you get it laid down
on the floor in the bedroom.

91
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,666
You're both already sweaty.

92
00:05:50,651 --> 00:05:52,399
Anyway, I think you're
making the right choice.

93
00:05:52,705 --> 00:05:54,098
A truck will never
let you down.

94
00:05:55,558 --> 00:05:56,619
I've got to go.

95
00:05:57,347 --> 00:05:59,070
<i>Oh, another one out !</i>

96
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:01,941
Can't we just throw
the thing in the trash?

97
00:06:02,159 --> 00:06:03,891
That is the worst possible place.

98
00:06:04,158 --> 00:06:06,437
Dad accidentally throws his car
keys out three times a week,

99
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:08,165
and he always ends up
going through the barrels.

100
00:06:11,087 --> 00:06:11,724
What was that?

101
00:06:16,513 --> 00:06:17,440
There's a handle here.

102
00:06:23,621 --> 00:06:25,223
Oh, my God, do you
know what this means?

103
00:06:25,474 --> 00:06:25,998
Yes!

104
00:06:26,441 --> 00:06:28,120
Rabbits have been
using our technology!

105
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:32,214
No, it's a bomb shelter. People built these
in the '50s and '60 in case of a nuclear war.

106
00:06:38,182 --> 00:06:39,536
This is incredible.

107
00:06:41,953 --> 00:06:43,072
<i>What the hell... ?</i>

108
00:06:43,434 --> 00:06:44,088
Dad?

109
00:06:44,508 --> 00:06:46,322
<i>Boys, are you down there?</i>

110
00:06:47,093 --> 00:06:49,138
Dad, look, we have a bomb shelter.

111
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,627
Oh, good God.

112
00:06:52,823 --> 00:06:54,965
I never knew this was here.

113
00:06:55,254 --> 00:06:56,256
Isn't it amazing?

114
00:06:56,418 --> 00:06:59,170
All right, let's get out of here.
We don't know how stable this place is.

115
00:06:59,497 --> 00:07:01,324
There could be snakes
and rats and...

116
00:07:02,284 --> 00:07:03,403
Is that my trophy?

117
00:07:04,482 --> 00:07:05,251
Yeah.

118
00:07:05,555 --> 00:07:05,944
Here!

119
00:07:09,426 --> 00:07:10,804
You broke the Middie!

120
00:07:11,622 --> 00:07:14,053
They only give out
200 of these a year!

121
00:07:15,009 --> 00:07:15,540
<i>Wait!</i>

122
00:07:19,302 --> 00:07:20,961
Hurry, get the trash cans!

123
00:07:21,401 --> 00:07:22,958
<i>You boys let
me out of here!</i>

124
00:07:33,659 --> 00:07:35,820
<i>You better not burry me
in here with the rats!</i>

125
00:07:36,652 --> 00:07:37,607
You want to see what's on TV?

126
00:07:37,615 --> 00:07:38,206
Okay.

127
00:07:38,714 --> 00:07:40,007
<i>Help me out!</i>

128
00:07:41,069 --> 00:07:42,429
They let me pick
Hanna as my partner.

129
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,556
We really got a shot at
winning this competition.

130
00:07:44,908 --> 00:07:47,448
Plus, I get to touch
her body, like, a lot.

131
00:07:51,515 --> 00:07:52,248
Sorry.

132
00:08:01,457 --> 00:08:04,698
Dad, if you can hear me,
knock once on the hatch.

133
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:10,684
Okay, it's pretty obvious we've
all made some mistakes here.

134
00:08:10,768 --> 00:08:13,390
There's no point in trying to figure
out who's right and who's wrong.

135
00:08:13,485 --> 00:08:18,776
The important thing is you forgive us so
we can forgive you so we can let you out.

136
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:22,206
Now if we're all on the same
page, knock once on the lid.

137
00:08:24,426 --> 00:08:25,883
He agreed. We're both witnesses.

138
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:37,363
You know Dad, I really think...

139
00:08:39,233 --> 00:08:40,260
It's a trick!

140
00:08:44,127 --> 00:08:44,898
I just...!

141
00:08:45,361 --> 00:08:47,702
Vengeance!

142
00:08:50,085 --> 00:08:50,727
<i>Back, Dad!</i>

143
00:08:50,984 --> 00:08:51,576
<i>Back, Dad!</i>

144
00:08:51,684 --> 00:08:52,048
Back!

145
00:08:52,507 --> 00:08:52,956
<i>Back!</i>

146
00:08:58,596 --> 00:09:00,274
I don't know if I can
trust Dad after this.

147
00:09:03,096 --> 00:09:03,867
You're insane.

148
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:06,418
I'm just saying, how much food
could there be down there?

149
00:09:06,435 --> 00:09:07,880
Eventually, this will
take care of itself.

150
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:08,596
Reese!

151
00:09:08,601 --> 00:09:09,656
He's had a long life.

152
00:09:09,698 --> 00:09:10,814
What is he, like, 70?

153
00:09:10,867 --> 00:09:11,576
Forget it.

154
00:09:12,097 --> 00:09:13,032
Ah, you're right.

155
00:09:13,514 --> 00:09:14,571
I forgot about Mom.

156
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:17,185
She's bound to notice eventually,
no matter how busy she is.

157
00:09:17,422 --> 00:09:20,123
And once she latches onto something,
you know how she never lets it go.

158
00:09:43,438 --> 00:09:45,294
Well, hello.

159
00:09:53,754 --> 00:09:54,873
Mr. President.

160
00:09:56,507 --> 00:09:59,690
Well, looks like we're
in this Cold War together.

161
00:10:00,858 --> 00:10:02,132
So, Jack...

162
00:10:03,313 --> 00:10:04,014
what are you drinking?

163
00:10:07,442 --> 00:10:09,616
So what if she's a klutz?
She's still beautiful, right?

164
00:10:11,395 --> 00:10:13,073
I can't wait for the competition.

165
00:10:13,305 --> 00:10:15,871
You and me out there
in front of everyone?

166
00:10:20,483 --> 00:10:23,512
All right, she's totally hot,
but she's got no presence.

167
00:10:23,763 --> 00:10:26,194
Her footwork's sloppy and her
jazz square'sall over the place.

168
00:10:34,045 --> 00:10:35,575
I'm just going to have to
make my peace with this.

169
00:10:35,745 --> 00:10:38,334
I chose Hanna for the contest and
now there's nothing I can do about it.

170
00:10:43,037 --> 00:10:44,200
Oh, my ankle!

171
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:45,647
I'm so sorry.
Are you all right?

172
00:10:46,527 --> 00:10:47,386
It hurts.

173
00:10:48,501 --> 00:10:49,933
I can't stand on it.

174
00:10:50,743 --> 00:10:52,564
Oh, my God, what a terrible accident.

175
00:10:53,315 --> 00:10:54,194
It was an accident.

176
00:10:54,526 --> 00:10:55,563
I'm so sorry.

177
00:10:56,468 --> 00:10:57,118
It was.

178
00:11:17,431 --> 00:11:19,370
Good! Perfect.

179
00:11:19,485 --> 00:11:21,943
All right now just turn and...

180
00:11:24,311 --> 00:11:26,416
I'm so glad you were still
available for the competition.

181
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:28,294
I was really upset by Hanna's, um...

182
00:11:28,741 --> 00:11:31,847
accidental injury, but I think
you and I might win this thing.

183
00:11:32,006 --> 00:11:33,972
Well, if we can do
it with our dancing,

184
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:37,406
maybe you could stop
sleeping with the judges.

185
00:11:37,465 --> 00:11:38,634
That'll free up my evenings.

186
00:11:40,194 --> 00:11:41,396
Who knew she banters, too.

187
00:12:06,693 --> 00:12:09,818
Salisbury steak... my old friend.

188
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:18,945
Ha-cha.

189
00:12:22,688 --> 00:12:24,038
Hello, ladies.

190
00:12:25,081 --> 00:12:25,556
<i>Dad?</i>

191
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:30,781
Dad, you alive?

192
00:12:30,924 --> 00:12:35,791
<i>The minute I get out of here,
you boys are in so much...</i>

193
00:12:38,834 --> 00:12:39,505
...trouble!

194
00:12:40,667 --> 00:12:42,903
Hey, if he's not willing to
negotiate, we've got no choice.

195
00:12:42,968 --> 00:12:44,015
We're going to have to split up.

196
00:12:45,044 --> 00:12:46,905
Okay, I'll meet you in
Mexico in five years.

197
00:12:47,048 --> 00:12:47,800
Wait a minute.

198
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:51,374
What if we do everything on his
"To Do" board and then let him out?

199
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:52,901
That's brilliant.

200
00:12:53,034 --> 00:12:54,969
He couldn't be mad at us
if we did all this for him.

201
00:12:55,473 --> 00:12:57,930
He's got stuff on here that he's
been meaning to do for years.

202
00:12:59,427 --> 00:13:00,943
"Change Dewey's diaper."

203
00:13:03,502 --> 00:13:05,361
So, for the contest, what do
you think we should wear?

204
00:13:05,794 --> 00:13:09,353
I was thinking about a really
hot sequined backless number.

205
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:11,246
And for me, something classy.

206
00:13:12,177 --> 00:13:14,500
Just so you know,
I was holding back in there.

207
00:13:14,661 --> 00:13:18,395
You two have no idea what I'm going
to unleash tomorrow at the contest.

208
00:13:18,404 --> 00:13:22,728
Well, if it's anything like what you
unleashed during stretching, we're
pulling out of the competition.

209
00:13:23,316 --> 00:13:26,845
Insults are for those who can't
express themselves... in motion!

210
00:13:30,294 --> 00:13:32,011
I think I'm falling in love with him.

211
00:13:32,525 --> 00:13:33,197
You, too?

212
00:13:35,376 --> 00:13:36,168
So, I'll see you tomorrow?

213
00:13:36,228 --> 00:13:36,789
Right.

214
00:13:37,113 --> 00:13:38,981
Oh, there was one more thing.

215
00:13:43,151 --> 00:13:44,177
Nope, that wasn't it.

216
00:13:44,612 --> 00:13:45,006
See ya.

217
00:13:50,489 --> 00:13:55,308
I'm sure it's nothing, Cheryl, but
you'll probably feel better after
a doctor's taken a look at it.

218
00:13:57,061 --> 00:13:59,654
<i>There's another one. She's
down and we're here in the...</i>

219
00:13:59,667 --> 00:14:01,477
Wow, Mom, just four
left. That's great.

220
00:14:01,654 --> 00:14:04,152
Yeah, and it'll be three
before you know it.

221
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:07,180
Mom, I need some advice on something.

222
00:14:07,184 --> 00:14:07,495
Sure.

223
00:14:07,594 --> 00:14:08,887
I started taking this
dance class, and...

224
00:14:08,891 --> 00:14:09,755
Good for you.

225
00:14:09,929 --> 00:14:11,212
I just signed up to meet a girl.

226
00:14:11,388 --> 00:14:12,076
Of course.

227
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:13,687
I got to dance with
the girl I wanted, but...

228
00:14:14,444 --> 00:14:17,170
she had an accident and I started
dancing with this other girl and...

229
00:14:17,452 --> 00:14:19,668
I didn't think there'd anything
other than dancing there, and...

230
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:21,520
And now she likes you and
you're going to break her heart?

231
00:14:21,698 --> 00:14:23,016
No, that's not it.

232
00:14:23,308 --> 00:14:24,105
I like her, too.

233
00:14:24,124 --> 00:14:25,279
You both like each other?

234
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:25,655
Yeah.

235
00:14:26,122 --> 00:14:27,685
So why are you bothering me?

236
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:28,600
I'm working here.

237
00:14:28,606 --> 00:14:32,557
The point is I like her, but she's
not exactly what I consider to be...

238
00:14:33,963 --> 00:14:34,754
a cute girl.

239
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:39,267
Oh, this is going
to be a tricky one.

240
00:14:40,467 --> 00:14:41,178
Here, hold this.

241
00:14:42,866 --> 00:14:44,043
What is wrong with you?

242
00:14:44,235 --> 00:14:46,060
You're attracted to her,
she's attracted to you.

243
00:14:46,066 --> 00:14:47,507
The only problem is in your head.

244
00:14:47,737 --> 00:14:51,891
Listen, if you're trying to
build relationships on looks,
you are in for a world hurt.

245
00:14:52,538 --> 00:14:53,676
Take Janet here.

246
00:14:54,263 --> 00:14:57,524
20 years ago she marries her husband
because she thinks he looks like Lee Majors.

247
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:59,914
And today he's lost all his
hair, he's gained 200 pounds,

248
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,063
and she is stuck with a blimp
who won't even put on his shirt
to come to the dinner table.

249
00:15:03,464 --> 00:15:08,828
She is reduced to trying to win
attention by bringing home a truck.
I mean, how sad is that?

250
00:15:10,424 --> 00:15:12,760
That is what I'm doing, isn't it?

251
00:15:13,684 --> 00:15:14,746
<i>There's another one.</i>

252
00:15:15,133 --> 00:15:18,632
<i>36 down. There's only three left
here, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

253
00:15:18,636 --> 00:15:19,206
You see that ?

254
00:15:20,268 --> 00:15:21,309
That took courage.

255
00:15:24,029 --> 00:15:26,977
I'll tell you, Jack, they
made women in those days.

256
00:15:27,324 --> 00:15:29,685
There's nothing wrong with
a little meat on the bones.

257
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,018
Now that is a fanny.

258
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:37,078
Ah, Jack, you died too young.

259
00:15:38,236 --> 00:15:38,969
We beat 'em.

260
00:15:39,316 --> 00:15:43,018
Now they're wearing blue jeans and
eating cheeseburgers in Red Square.

261
00:15:43,363 --> 00:15:44,960
Oh, and we made it to the moon.

262
00:15:46,443 --> 00:15:48,024
Big waste of money.

263
00:15:50,246 --> 00:15:52,354
l'll tell you what
I miss the most, Jack.

264
00:15:53,556 --> 00:15:58,009
All these years, we have never
had a president as cool as you.

265
00:15:58,539 --> 00:15:59,716
Here's to you, buddy.

266
00:16:04,813 --> 00:16:06,241
You're right to look
at me like that.

267
00:16:06,742 --> 00:16:09,347
You just can't drink a
martini without an olive.

268
00:16:26,036 --> 00:16:28,413
Oh, would you look at that.
We have a back door.

269
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:30,346
I'll be right back, Jack.

270
00:16:46,211 --> 00:16:49,410
<i>After you finish the fireplace,
I'll start scrubbing the shower tiles.</i>

271
00:16:49,513 --> 00:16:52,316
<i>And I'll give Jamie a bath,
then we can both do the gutters.</i>

272
00:16:52,483 --> 00:16:55,685
All right, but first we have to shampoo
the rug to give it time to dry.

273
00:17:12,978 --> 00:17:16,773
If you are 99% sure you turned your
oven off, don't drive yourself crazy.

274
00:17:16,921 --> 00:17:19,508
Besides, dogs have an
instinct to run away from fire.

275
00:17:21,435 --> 00:17:23,488
<i>Well, there was number three.</i>

276
00:17:24,545 --> 00:17:25,752
And then they were two.

277
00:17:26,043 --> 00:17:28,867
<i>Don't go anywere, folks,
we're going to crown a winner.</i>

278
00:17:31,306 --> 00:17:32,412
So it's just you and me.

279
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:35,285
All the little
children have gone home.

280
00:17:37,239 --> 00:17:38,142
You have any kids?

281
00:17:39,179 --> 00:17:39,614
Four.

282
00:17:40,183 --> 00:17:40,696
Five.

283
00:17:42,023 --> 00:17:43,300
-Epidurals?
-Please.

284
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:45,255
You tear?

285
00:17:45,482 --> 00:17:47,083
Like an old sock.

286
00:17:47,788 --> 00:17:50,266
All right ladies, it's time for
another bathroom break.

287
00:17:55,068 --> 00:17:56,265
You're not taking a break, Mabel?

288
00:17:56,457 --> 00:17:57,306
I'm good.

289
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:06,276
Me, too.

290
00:18:39,007 --> 00:18:41,992
Hey, Danielle. Before we go there,
there's something I need to tell you.

291
00:18:42,012 --> 00:18:43,038
I like you a lot.

292
00:18:43,513 --> 00:18:44,095
You do?

293
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:45,682
I mean, great.

294
00:18:45,878 --> 00:18:47,479
You know, I'd never
would have expected it.

295
00:18:53,381 --> 00:18:56,295
And now, Malcolm and Danielle.

296
00:19:11,363 --> 00:19:12,636
Why wouldn't you have expected it?

297
00:19:13,697 --> 00:19:14,276
Huh?

298
00:19:15,974 --> 00:19:17,575
Why wouldn't you have
expected to like me?

299
00:19:22,099 --> 00:19:24,549
It wasn't a criticism
of you. It's just that...

300
00:19:25,418 --> 00:19:28,622
Sometimes I can be really
shallow about these things.

301
00:19:30,068 --> 00:19:30,955
Malcolm?

302
00:19:35,408 --> 00:19:37,374
So what kind of guys do you
like when you're shallow?

303
00:19:42,687 --> 00:19:44,432
No, it's nothing. It's just that...

304
00:19:45,003 --> 00:19:48,495
I've made mistakes in the past going
after guys just based on their looks.

305
00:19:48,504 --> 00:19:50,781
So you almost didn't go out with me
because I'm not good-looking enough?

306
00:19:52,631 --> 00:19:55,051
Would you let it go,
okay? I like you.

307
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,258
Now dip me.

308
00:19:56,633 --> 00:19:57,831
-Face or body?
-What?

309
00:19:57,851 --> 00:19:59,150
Face or body, which don't you like?

310
00:19:59,161 --> 00:20:00,197
Or maybe you don't like any of it.

311
00:20:00,345 --> 00:20:01,831
It's all fine.

312
00:20:01,836 --> 00:20:02,990
It's good enough.
Now dip me.

313
00:20:03,012 --> 00:20:04,248
I can't believe you'd think like that.

314
00:20:04,301 --> 00:20:05,438
For God's sakes!

315
00:20:06,137 --> 00:20:07,204
You know, you're no prize.

316
00:20:12,442 --> 00:20:15,177
No, we can't let Dad out until
we do everything on the list.

317
00:20:15,232 --> 00:20:16,312
If Dad's going to act like...

318
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:17,934
I can explain.

319
00:20:19,158 --> 00:20:19,679
Wait a minute.

320
00:20:20,393 --> 00:20:22,168
You've been sneaking
out the whole time?

321
00:20:22,728 --> 00:20:23,827
Is that party mix?

322
00:20:23,898 --> 00:20:26,324
You're damn right it's party mix.

323
00:20:26,506 --> 00:20:32,017
This is the only thing that has kept me
sane while I was trapped in that hellhole.

324
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:33,037
Then why are you going back?

325
00:20:36,551 --> 00:20:38,479
I am not on trial here.

326
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:40,166
I can't believe he
wasn't really trapped.

327
00:20:40,462 --> 00:20:42,356
Come on, Dewey, let's
go mess up the house.

328
00:20:43,369 --> 00:20:46,008
I did it! I won the truck!

329
00:20:46,011 --> 00:20:47,699
Lois, you're not going to believe
what these boys have done.

330
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:50,009
-They trapped me in a hole...
I was there for three days.
-He wasn't trapped...

331
00:20:50,925 --> 00:20:53,276
Did you hear what I said?
I said I won the truck!

332
00:20:54,789 --> 00:20:55,646
-Oh, my God!
-You won the truck!

333
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:56,849
We won the truck!

334
00:20:57,108 --> 00:20:57,905
We won the truck!

335
00:20:58,024 --> 00:20:58,854
We won the truck!

336
00:20:59,079 --> 00:20:59,852
We won the truck!

337
00:20:59,899 --> 00:21:01,179
Let's go for a ride.

338
00:21:01,236 --> 00:21:01,968
Just a sec.

339
00:21:02,003 --> 00:21:03,449
First I have to change my pants.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
