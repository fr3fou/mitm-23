1
00:00:07,844 --> 00:00:08,944
Give me the candy bar.

2
00:00:11,642 --> 00:00:13,263
You heard me, Jamie. Give it.

3
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:21,229
<i>Where is it?</i>

4
00:00:21,441 --> 00:00:22,491
<i>Where'd it go?</i>

5
00:00:27,429 --> 00:00:30,574
Wow, I was five before
I got Reese to fall for that.

6
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:38,290
Malcolm in the Middle
7.05 - "Jessica Stays Over"

7
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:49,290
Synchronisation par Max & Tyno,
Script original par Raceman.

8
00:00:54,290 --> 00:01:00,290
Forom.com, Life-is-Unfair.tk
& Malcolm-France.com

9
00:01:08,595 --> 00:01:09,116
Sorry.

10
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:11,096
I didn't... Sorry.

11
00:01:11,217 --> 00:01:15,067
It's no big deal, Malcolm. You know,
one day you will be old enough to shave.

12
00:01:16,811 --> 00:01:17,641
-Go.
-Oh...

13
00:01:18,073 --> 00:01:19,101
Yeah, okay.

14
00:01:21,256 --> 00:01:22,706
That's Jessica, our neighbor.

15
00:01:22,806 --> 00:01:25,924
Mom and Dad are letting her
sleep on our couch for a week
until her father's arraigned.

16
00:01:25,954 --> 00:01:31,404
Seems he got drunk Friday night, decided
to track down her mom and tried to
drive a street-sweeper to Mexico.

17
00:01:32,445 --> 00:01:33,930
She has some family issues.

18
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:36,219
<i>Malcolm, Reese,
Jessica, let's go.</i>

19
00:01:39,313 --> 00:01:41,070
-What are you doing?
-Are you kidding?

20
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,609
No way I'm letting Jessica
get a look at the goods.

21
00:01:43,639 --> 00:01:45,568
What is taking
you boys so long?

22
00:01:45,586 --> 00:01:48,224
Tell Sasquatch in there to give
us a shot at the bathroom.

23
00:01:48,254 --> 00:01:51,153
Hey, Mom, can I borrow your car
tonight? Frank Miller's signing
his new graphic novel...

24
00:01:51,183 --> 00:01:54,651
You're going to drive it the way
you threw your pants in a wad
behind the hamper yesterday?

25
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:55,723
I don't think so.

26
00:01:56,553 --> 00:01:57,132
What?

27
00:01:58,112 --> 00:02:00,462
How does her mind even
form thoughts like that?

28
00:02:04,775 --> 00:02:05,702
Is that a bee?

29
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,747
That is how you
know it's fresh.

30
00:02:07,785 --> 00:02:11,371
You won't find any bees in
your store-bought honey,
I'll tell you that much.

31
00:02:11,401 --> 00:02:14,064
-Where did this come from?
-Spoils of war, Dewey.

32
00:02:14,368 --> 00:02:17,167
You know that beehive in the toolshed
I've been battling for months?

33
00:02:17,197 --> 00:02:19,493
Victory is mine.

34
00:02:19,579 --> 00:02:20,705
You did it yourself?

35
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,560
How'd you know how to do that?

36
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:23,440
It's instinctual.

37
00:02:23,516 --> 00:02:27,976
See, human beings were born with
everything they need to destroy bees.

38
00:02:28,152 --> 00:02:30,834
Except the poison,
you have to buy that.

39
00:02:31,347 --> 00:02:33,015
I feel kind of sorry
for the bees, though.

40
00:02:33,045 --> 00:02:34,916
It's survival of
the fittest, Dewey.

41
00:02:35,185 --> 00:02:38,349
If they had won, they'd be
spreading us on toast right now.

42
00:02:40,278 --> 00:02:40,934
Big deal.

43
00:02:41,243 --> 00:02:43,293
So I don't get the car to
go to the book signing.

44
00:02:43,323 --> 00:02:46,323
Meeting your heroes is always
such a disappointment, anyway.

45
00:02:53,845 --> 00:02:54,655
Hi, Malcolm.

46
00:02:55,046 --> 00:02:56,177
You got the car?

47
00:02:56,684 --> 00:02:57,929
How'd you get the car?

48
00:02:58,583 --> 00:03:01,389
I just had a little shopping to do,
and your mom insisted I take the car.

49
00:03:01,419 --> 00:03:02,865
What do you mean she insisted?

50
00:03:02,895 --> 00:03:05,552
I've been begging her for weeks.
Every time I ask, she says no.

51
00:03:05,582 --> 00:03:07,332
That's where you
made your mistake.

52
00:03:07,558 --> 00:03:10,304
I just got all vulnerable and
poured on stuff about my dad.

53
00:03:10,334 --> 00:03:11,183
It was easy.

54
00:03:11,556 --> 00:03:12,149
No way.

55
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:16,880
Look, Malcolm, it's not something
I'm proud of, believe me.

56
00:03:17,169 --> 00:03:19,869
It's how I've learned to
survive in my twisted family.

57
00:03:20,399 --> 00:03:23,899
They're like a total cesspool of
manipulation and emotional blackmail.

58
00:03:24,029 --> 00:03:25,746
Everyone screwing
everyone over.

59
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:30,690
I don't even know a true, honest
way to connect with people anymore.

60
00:03:31,363 --> 00:03:32,231
It's sick.

61
00:03:33,076 --> 00:03:34,195
I'm sick!

62
00:03:35,251 --> 00:03:36,100
Jessica, wait.

63
00:03:37,724 --> 00:03:38,438
I'm sorry.

64
00:03:39,525 --> 00:03:41,925
Ah, thanks for carrying
my bags for me, Malcolm.

65
00:03:42,358 --> 00:03:43,408
Told you it was easy.

66
00:03:47,623 --> 00:03:49,573
You can bite my American ass, Zhao Lee.

67
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:51,584
What's that?

68
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:54,428
The school made us adopt pen
pals from different countries.

69
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:56,408
I got stuck with this
loser from China.

70
00:03:56,729 --> 00:03:58,873
-What's wrong with China?
-It's not what you think, Dewey.

71
00:03:58,903 --> 00:04:02,597
He won't send you illegal fireworks
or get your nunchucks autographed
by the emperor.

72
00:04:02,627 --> 00:04:03,862
The guy's a total jerk.

73
00:04:04,358 --> 00:04:07,286
It started off with a simple request
to apologize for Pearl Harbor.

74
00:04:07,316 --> 00:04:08,466
The guy wouldn't do it.

75
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:11,406
He's so arrogant.
When I draw squiggles, it's nonsense.

76
00:04:11,434 --> 00:04:13,084
When he does it,
it's a language.

77
00:04:13,265 --> 00:04:14,422
I was so pissed.

78
00:04:14,892 --> 00:04:17,988
But then I thought, be the better man,
and reason with the guy.

79
00:04:18,018 --> 00:04:19,718
"Do you want me to
kick your butt?

80
00:04:20,067 --> 00:04:21,591
Check yes or no."

81
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:25,394
And there's his response. He couldn't
even follow simple instructions.

82
00:04:25,397 --> 00:04:27,017
"You need help, Reese."

83
00:04:27,104 --> 00:04:29,535
He thinks a whole planet between
us is going to protect him.

84
00:04:29,565 --> 00:04:30,974
He thinks he's so smart.

85
00:04:31,012 --> 00:04:34,545
We'll see who's smart when I mail myself
to China and kick him upside-down ass.

86
00:04:34,575 --> 00:04:34,915
What?

87
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:36,621
Reese, that's crazy.

88
00:04:36,661 --> 00:04:38,511
Name one thing that's crazy about it.

89
00:04:39,732 --> 00:04:41,748
You're right. I take it back.

90
00:04:41,812 --> 00:04:45,262
I can't wait to see his face when
he opens up his mail and I pop out.

91
00:04:46,404 --> 00:04:49,017
And how are you supposed to
get back after you beat him up?

92
00:04:49,047 --> 00:04:51,709
Dewey, you know nothing
about Asian culture.

93
00:04:52,092 --> 00:04:57,243
After I humiliate him, I earn
his respect, plus half his land
and his sister, if she's hot.

94
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:01,648
All I got to do is stay off of Mom's
radar for the next three days.

95
00:05:03,266 --> 00:05:04,347
You call this clean?

96
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,751
I have to say, Mom, if you're just
going to phone it in, why even bother?

97
00:05:07,781 --> 00:05:10,581
You just bought yourself two
days grounded in your room.

98
00:05:10,609 --> 00:05:11,115
Fine.

99
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:14,019
Maybe you can use that time
to learn how to roll socks.

100
00:05:14,142 --> 00:05:16,392
Make it three days.
You want to try for more?

101
00:05:16,398 --> 00:05:17,498
Nope. Three's perfect.

102
00:05:25,949 --> 00:05:28,014
Hey, survivor, huh?

103
00:05:29,018 --> 00:05:31,918
I guess you weren't around when
Uncle Hal came a-knockin'.

104
00:05:32,822 --> 00:05:34,622
Oh, all right, all right.
Let it go.

105
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:36,236
War's over.

106
00:05:40,743 --> 00:05:42,828
All right, knock it off!

107
00:05:43,332 --> 00:05:44,350
I mean it!

108
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,183
Back off!

109
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:50,294
I'm warning you!

110
00:05:55,393 --> 00:05:57,187
Your friends died like cowards.

111
00:06:01,768 --> 00:06:02,868
What's wrong with you?

112
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:03,835
Nothing. I'm fine.

113
00:06:03,893 --> 00:06:07,546
Aw, this crisper is disgusting.
It's like vegetable soup in there.

114
00:06:07,569 --> 00:06:09,519
Malcolm, get a sponge
and clean it out.

115
00:06:09,689 --> 00:06:10,100
Okay.

116
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,560
You're not going to fight me
or try to weasel out of it?

117
00:06:15,338 --> 00:06:16,538
All right, what's wrong?

118
00:06:17,167 --> 00:06:18,267
Nothing. It's just...

119
00:06:19,673 --> 00:06:22,534
-There's this math test coming
up, and... I don't know...
-Malcolm, stop.

120
00:06:22,564 --> 00:06:24,288
You're going to ace it
like you always do.

121
00:06:24,318 --> 00:06:27,368
That's just the point. You totally
expect me to get a hundred.

122
00:06:27,492 --> 00:06:31,342
My teacher expects me to get a hundred.
Everyone expects me to get a hundred.

123
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:36,351
Do ynow what it's like every time
you do anything in school to have
everyone expect you to be perfect?

124
00:06:36,381 --> 00:06:39,381
Do you have any idea what kind
of pressure that puts on you?

125
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:43,792
It was so easy.

126
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:48,368
I started with this load of crap about
my math test and then the rest just
came pouring out of me so naturally.

127
00:06:48,398 --> 00:06:52,685
Before I knew it she was telling
me to take the car and go and
have fun with my friends.

128
00:06:52,715 --> 00:06:54,171
She even gave me money for gas.

129
00:06:54,201 --> 00:06:54,832
Nice.

130
00:06:56,345 --> 00:06:57,194
Is that a tear?

131
00:06:57,907 --> 00:06:58,641
No.

132
00:07:04,442 --> 00:07:10,982
Six boxes of cereal, two gallons of
milk, eight peanut butter and jelly
sandwiches, adult diapers and Madlibs.

133
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:12,233
You thought of everything.

134
00:07:12,263 --> 00:07:15,713
And I also packed some barbells so
I can get there in fighting shape.

135
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:18,144
-They look like soup cans.
-You noticed.

136
00:07:18,395 --> 00:07:20,845
See, there's a lot of
things that serve two purs.

137
00:07:20,864 --> 00:07:21,868
Like my pillow.

138
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:25,909
It's stuffed with M&M's so I can sleep
and snack from the same source.

139
00:07:25,939 --> 00:07:28,689
It's the same way NASA designed
the old space capsules.

140
00:07:28,714 --> 00:07:30,065
The very same.

141
00:07:30,072 --> 00:07:32,127
And you'll be ready with the
tapes to cover with Mom, right?

142
00:07:32,157 --> 00:07:34,329
-Yeah.
-All right, let's get moving.

143
00:07:34,644 --> 00:07:36,994
I want to be at the post
office for the 4:00 pick-up.

144
00:07:37,024 --> 00:07:38,774
Should I get you
stamped "fragile"?

145
00:07:39,029 --> 00:07:40,479
What's that supposed to mean?

146
00:08:00,385 --> 00:08:02,083
And the journey begins.

147
00:08:05,421 --> 00:08:09,097
Malcolm, you wouldn't happen to know
the life expectancy of a bee, would you?

148
00:08:09,127 --> 00:08:10,352
-I don't know.
-Great.

149
00:08:11,085 --> 00:08:15,204
What's the point of hauling around
that giant head of yours if you can't
retain a few simple facts?

150
00:08:15,234 --> 00:08:19,129
Hal, he gets enough pressure from
school without his family piling on.

151
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,746
Did Mom just defend me?

152
00:08:22,109 --> 00:08:25,165
Wow, this vulnerability crap is
more effective than I thought.

153
00:08:25,195 --> 00:08:27,009
Reese's eggs are stone cold.

154
00:08:27,163 --> 00:08:29,013
Dewey, you can bring
them to him now.

155
00:08:39,464 --> 00:08:41,214
<i>It's about time, butt-munch.</i>

156
00:08:41,629 --> 00:08:44,029
<i>She actually expects
me to eat this slop?</i>

157
00:08:45,917 --> 00:08:48,823
Hal... what are you
doing home? It's 10:15.

158
00:08:48,946 --> 00:08:50,335
It's that bee, Lois.

159
00:08:50,354 --> 00:08:52,515
He attacked me again
on my way to the car.

160
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:54,193
I barely made it back in here.

161
00:08:54,369 --> 00:08:56,169
The damn thing won't
leave me alone.

162
00:08:56,258 --> 00:08:58,481
-He's on some crazy vendetta.
-Hal!

163
00:08:58,488 --> 00:09:01,288
Okay, maybe it's not that
crazy when you think about it.

164
00:09:01,462 --> 00:09:06,130
I mean, I did kill all his family
and friends and basically
destroyed his whole world.

165
00:09:07,216 --> 00:09:08,594
That's got to come as a blow.

166
00:09:08,624 --> 00:09:10,448
Hal, you have got to go to work.

167
00:09:10,464 --> 00:09:11,583
I know, you're right.

168
00:09:11,749 --> 00:09:12,926
This is absurd.

169
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:14,862
Okay.

170
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,060
Here's the plan, Lois.

171
00:09:17,111 --> 00:09:21,511
I am going to move very casually
toward the back door and draw
his attention over there.

172
00:09:21,565 --> 00:09:26,015
Once he's diverted, you run
lickety-split to my car and drive
it right up here to the side doors.

173
00:09:26,045 --> 00:09:30,985
Honk the horn. Two short beeps,
then one long. I'll count to three
we'll open the doors simultaneously.

174
00:09:31,015 --> 00:09:32,254
You've got to be kidding me.

175
00:09:32,284 --> 00:09:35,391
Hey, I am not going to
let some bee run my life.

176
00:09:40,841 --> 00:09:42,991
-Where are you going?
-Rick Kessler's party.

177
00:09:43,129 --> 00:09:44,229
How you getting there?

178
00:09:44,244 --> 00:09:48,394
I'm going to tell my mom how
I can't beat people's expectations
on my science test.

179
00:09:49,308 --> 00:09:50,558
Are you a complete moron?

180
00:09:50,898 --> 00:09:51,246
What?

181
00:09:51,795 --> 00:09:52,522
Amateurs.

182
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:56,056
You are not trying to
manipulate a guy here, Malcolm.

183
00:09:56,654 --> 00:09:59,432
-You have to use your brain.
-But it worked great last time.

184
00:09:59,462 --> 00:10:03,235
Which is why you can never use it again.
Especially with your mom's radar.

185
00:10:04,059 --> 00:10:05,845
Come on, sit down,
listen to me.

186
00:10:06,771 --> 00:10:08,495
You got lucky the first time.

187
00:10:08,535 --> 00:10:13,939
But if you want to pull this off,
getting the car two nights in a row,
you have to be very, very good.

188
00:10:14,606 --> 00:10:15,779
-Why can't I just...
-Hey!

189
00:10:15,809 --> 00:10:17,844
Do you want to ride Jamie's
Big Wheel to the party?

190
00:10:17,874 --> 00:10:23,160
I am telling you, you have to share some
real fear or feeling of inadequacy.

191
00:10:23,275 --> 00:10:26,675
If you are not totally honest,
she will see right through your scam.

192
00:10:27,317 --> 00:10:27,876
Okay.

193
00:10:29,521 --> 00:10:30,312
So, like what?

194
00:10:30,555 --> 00:10:32,355
Well, I don't know.
What do you got?

195
00:10:33,367 --> 00:10:35,185
Well, I, uh...

196
00:10:35,195 --> 00:10:37,945
Come on, Malcolm, your biggest
problem is choosing one.

197
00:10:38,042 --> 00:10:40,415
Okay, well, I'm not that tall.

198
00:10:41,068 --> 00:10:44,018
-That's what you're going with?
-I don't know. This is hard.

199
00:10:44,457 --> 00:10:48,247
We'll go down the list and see which one
makes you feel the most uncomfortable.

200
00:10:48,277 --> 00:10:49,868
We've established
that you're short.

201
00:10:49,898 --> 00:10:50,457
Yeah.

202
00:10:50,612 --> 00:10:51,562
And pretty scrawny.

203
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:52,261
Yeah.

204
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,743
And completely self-absorbed.

205
00:10:53,773 --> 00:10:54,188
Yeah.

206
00:10:54,309 --> 00:10:55,642
With huge mother issues.

207
00:10:55,983 --> 00:10:56,315
Yeah.

208
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:57,945
You don't really put
out a sexual vibe.

209
00:10:57,975 --> 00:10:59,166
-Hey!
-Bingo.

210
00:11:09,284 --> 00:11:12,101
It was amazing.
We've never really talked like that.

211
00:11:13,011 --> 00:11:15,711
She said she felt like a
total outcast in high school.

212
00:11:16,085 --> 00:11:17,435
She told me all this stuff.

213
00:11:17,526 --> 00:11:21,926
Like really personal stuff,
but it didn't feel creepy like
your mom's telling you stuff.

214
00:11:22,299 --> 00:11:23,899
It was more like
we were equals.

215
00:11:24,633 --> 00:11:25,405
It was great.

216
00:11:26,081 --> 00:11:26,853
Good work.

217
00:11:27,393 --> 00:11:28,393
Did you get the car?

218
00:11:28,815 --> 00:11:29,278
What?

219
00:11:29,645 --> 00:11:30,899
Oh, yeah.

220
00:11:31,493 --> 00:11:34,108
You know, I think
I'm going to skip the party.

221
00:11:34,393 --> 00:11:36,654
-You're kidding.
-Yeah, I don't know, I just...

222
00:11:36,684 --> 00:11:38,434
I don't really feel
like going out.

223
00:11:40,849 --> 00:11:41,549
You know what?

224
00:11:42,161 --> 00:11:44,711
I think I'm going to stay
home and start a journal.

225
00:11:49,094 --> 00:11:50,464
Stupid jet engine.

226
00:11:58,156 --> 00:12:00,656
Why don't you learn how
to fly this stupid thing?!

227
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:13,699
Oh, sure, I feel lonely.

228
00:12:13,892 --> 00:12:17,492
Sometimes even with my family all
around me, I feel like there's this...

229
00:12:17,808 --> 00:12:22,458
I don't know, this-this gulf between
us that I can't get across and maybe
don't even want to.

230
00:12:22,637 --> 00:12:26,150
-Does that sound awful?
-No, no. I know exactly
what you're talking about.

231
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:29,891
There's this deep chasm of loneliness,
but the weird thing is, it's...

232
00:12:30,223 --> 00:12:31,573
it's not all that horrible.

233
00:12:32,172 --> 00:12:33,542
It's almost like this...

234
00:12:33,792 --> 00:12:35,490
-This...
-Sweet pain?

235
00:12:36,133 --> 00:12:37,252
Oh, my God.

236
00:12:37,944 --> 00:12:39,862
I thought I was the only
one who felt that way.

237
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:43,448
Well, it's not something
I really talk about. I can't
believe I'm even telling you.

238
00:12:43,478 --> 00:12:45,928
Don't worry, Mom. I...
I understand. I really do.

239
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:50,433
Oh, look at the time. Malcolm,
we've gabbed the whole morning
away. I got to get dressed for work.

240
00:12:50,463 --> 00:12:52,113
Go ahead. I'll finish the dishes.

241
00:12:52,545 --> 00:12:54,045
I’m gonna take you up on that.

242
00:12:57,171 --> 00:12:58,464
<i>That was genius.</i>

243
00:13:00,764 --> 00:13:01,497
Jessica?

244
00:13:02,002 --> 00:13:05,495
-You were there the whole time?
-Seriously, that was awesome.

245
00:13:05,956 --> 00:13:07,106
What are you going for?

246
00:13:07,114 --> 00:13:07,982
What? Nothing.

247
00:13:08,215 --> 00:13:09,296
Malcolm, it's me.

248
00:13:10,135 --> 00:13:14,173
What are you after? I mean
you've got her opening up
to you. Forget about the car.

249
00:13:14,203 --> 00:13:16,822
With that level of intimacy,
I'd shoot for a laptop.

250
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:19,017
We were just talking
about things we felt.

251
00:13:19,047 --> 00:13:21,844
Wow, Malcolm, that's really...

252
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:24,490
-Pathetic.
-Shut up.

253
00:13:24,702 --> 00:13:29,180
Listen, Monday I need you to get
your mom out of the house for
a couple of hours after school.

254
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:30,672
Take her to a chick
flick or something.

255
00:13:30,702 --> 00:13:31,688
You should enjoy that.

256
00:13:31,718 --> 00:13:32,338
What for?

257
00:13:32,426 --> 00:13:36,328
My boyfriend's coming over, and
I'd like to have the house to ourselves,
if you know what I mean.

258
00:13:36,358 --> 00:13:36,940
What?!

259
00:13:36,978 --> 00:13:38,748
Oh, good, you do
know what I mean.

260
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,489
I wasn't sure with that whole
chasm of loneliness crap.

261
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,036
You can't hook up in my house.

262
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:46,710
-I've never hooked up in my house.
-Okay, Malcolm, it's your decision.

263
00:13:47,579 --> 00:13:50,066
Just a little worried how your
mom might react when she finds out

264
00:13:50,096 --> 00:13:53,372
that the only reason you've been
opening up to her is to get her car.

265
00:13:53,402 --> 00:13:54,852
That's not even true anymore.

266
00:13:55,132 --> 00:13:56,791
Anyway, you'd look just as bad.

267
00:13:56,868 --> 00:13:59,318
Malcolm, my dad's in jail,
and I live on a couch.

268
00:13:59,511 --> 00:14:02,023
Looking bad isn't really
a big motivator for me.

269
00:14:02,987 --> 00:14:04,087
Now, you owe me.

270
00:14:04,318 --> 00:14:05,968
You'd really do it,
wouldn't you?

271
00:14:05,997 --> 00:14:06,884
Knowing me...

272
00:14:08,545 --> 00:14:09,185
Yeah.

273
00:14:09,659 --> 00:14:11,992
Fine, but I can't believe
you're being like this.

274
00:14:12,022 --> 00:14:14,345
I thought you were helping me
because you were my friend.

275
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:15,263
Yeah, Malcolm?

276
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:16,933
Save the girl talk
for your mom.

277
00:14:23,107 --> 00:14:24,033
<i>"Day 23.</i>

278
00:14:25,027 --> 00:14:28,808
<i>"I'm out of food, "but I've never
felt so focused  and alive.</i>

279
00:14:29,576 --> 00:14:32,476
<i>I see everything now
with crystal clarity that..."</i>

280
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:43,807
<i>"Day 24.</i>

281
00:14:44,455 --> 00:14:46,055
<i>"I must be
getting close.</i>

282
00:14:46,188 --> 00:14:47,688
<i>I can smell the docks."</i>

283
00:15:02,344 --> 00:15:04,563
I know Mommy wanted us
to go to the park.

284
00:15:04,766 --> 00:15:07,969
But why go outside where bad
things want to hurt Daddy,

285
00:15:08,069 --> 00:15:11,319
when we can have just as much fun
inside the house, right, Jamie?

286
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:14,691
How about a nice shaving
cream beard, huh?

287
00:15:14,864 --> 00:15:17,414
I did one last week at work,
and everyone loved it.

288
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:32,722
Don't worry, Jamie,
it's me he's after, not you.

289
00:15:33,774 --> 00:15:35,424
<i>Stop looking
at me, Dewey.</i>

290
00:15:35,665 --> 00:15:36,850
<i>I'm not looking at you.</i>

291
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:37,980
<i>Don't touch me.</i>

292
00:15:38,038 --> 00:15:40,495
-<i>I'm not touching you.</i>
-<i>You're practically touching me.</i>

293
00:15:40,525 --> 00:15:42,037
-<i>Shut up.</i>
-<i>You shut up.</i>

294
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:43,857
-<i>Why don't you?</i>
-<i>Why don't you make me?</i>

295
00:15:43,887 --> 00:15:46,073
-<i>Why don't you make me?</i>
-<i>Maybe I will.</i>

296
00:15:46,103 --> 00:15:50,432
He thinks he's on his way to
China, and you've just been
torturing him in that box?!

297
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:51,854
Yeah.

298
00:15:52,196 --> 00:15:53,396
Can he breathe in there?

299
00:15:53,851 --> 00:15:55,101
He's still making noises.

300
00:15:55,572 --> 00:15:56,912
And he's got food and water?

301
00:15:56,942 --> 00:15:57,194
Yeah.

302
00:16:01,995 --> 00:16:02,670
All right.

303
00:16:07,524 --> 00:16:12,174
Honestly, Hal, I haven't felt this close
to Malcolm since he was four years old.

304
00:16:14,551 --> 00:16:17,051
Did I tell you he's taking
me to a movie tomorrow?

305
00:16:17,056 --> 00:16:18,059
I can't believe it.

306
00:16:19,381 --> 00:16:23,413
I mean, put out there, yon't know
whether it'll ever come back to you.

307
00:16:24,468 --> 00:16:29,014
And then, when it does,
it's wonderful.

308
00:16:30,345 --> 00:16:32,745
It's worth all the crap
you have to put up with.

309
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:36,394
Our boy is growing up, Lois.

310
00:16:38,485 --> 00:16:41,225
-I'm very proud of both of you.
-Thanks, honey.

311
00:16:44,018 --> 00:16:46,391
-Can you turn off the smoke now?
-In a minute.

312
00:16:48,557 --> 00:16:51,107
-How long do we have the place?
-At least two hours.

313
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,050
So, what do you want to do?

314
00:16:56,122 --> 00:16:59,422
-Jessica, I have to talk to you.
-Malcolm, what are you doing here?

315
00:16:59,703 --> 00:17:01,453
-Where's Lois?
-Still at the movies.

316
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,388
I told her everything.

317
00:17:03,546 --> 00:17:04,923
I couldn't hold
it back from her.

318
00:17:04,953 --> 00:17:08,351
We where in the lobby, and
I saw something that reminded
me of how much she really loves me.

319
00:17:08,381 --> 00:17:11,145
This mom was holding up her
son so he could get a drink
of water, and I thought,

320
00:17:11,175 --> 00:17:14,287
"What kind of Mom lets their kid
drink from a public king fountain?"

321
00:17:14,317 --> 00:17:18,902
She would have yelled at me about all the
germs, and I thought about how much she
really cares about me, and I couldn't hold it back.

322
00:17:18,932 --> 00:17:21,582
-Malcolm, we'll talk
about this later.
-It was horrible.

323
00:17:22,818 --> 00:17:26,814
I tried to explain that
getting close to her started
off as a way to use her, but...

324
00:17:26,844 --> 00:17:28,423
It turned into something real.

325
00:17:29,942 --> 00:17:31,003
But she didn't care.

326
00:17:31,975 --> 00:17:33,314
She was just too hurt.

327
00:17:33,476 --> 00:17:35,660
She said she didn't want
to look at me anymore.

328
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:39,540
And then she walked right
out of Autumn Encounter and
straight into Body Count III.

329
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:43,310
It's too bad, because Autumn
Encounter looked really good.

330
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:45,265
Can make myself a sandwich?

331
00:17:45,419 --> 00:17:46,932
Wait. Mike,
this won't take long.

332
00:17:46,962 --> 00:17:49,029
My mom used to make
me sandwiches.

333
00:17:49,737 --> 00:17:53,047
Now she'll never make
me sandwiches again.

334
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:55,265
Malcolm pull yourself together!

335
00:17:55,392 --> 00:17:56,619
This is kind of weird.

336
00:17:57,163 --> 00:17:59,305
Wait. Wait, Mike. Mike?

337
00:18:06,887 --> 00:18:07,254
Hi.

338
00:18:08,315 --> 00:18:08,643
Hi.

339
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:09,892
I'm Mike, Jessica's friend.

340
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:10,332
Dewey.

341
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,156
Mind if I make
myself a sandwich?

342
00:18:12,186 --> 00:18:12,836
I don't care.

343
00:18:17,398 --> 00:18:19,161
Wait, can you do
me a favor first?

344
00:18:19,971 --> 00:18:22,433
There's this crate in the
garage I can't get open.

345
00:18:22,463 --> 00:18:24,013
-You look really strong.
-Sure.

346
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:36,290
I bet you weren't
expecting this, Zhao!

347
00:18:36,308 --> 00:18:39,358
Now you're gonna experience a
good old American ass-whuppin'.

348
00:18:39,931 --> 00:18:40,742
Hey, quit it!

349
00:18:40,868 --> 00:18:42,735
I don't speak Chinese, jackass.

350
00:18:44,634 --> 00:18:45,213
All right.

351
00:19:03,712 --> 00:19:04,348
You!

352
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,168
Okay, let's... stay calm.

353
00:19:10,391 --> 00:19:12,204
Let's not do anything stupid.

354
00:19:14,429 --> 00:19:15,929
<i>Eat wind, honey sucker!</i>

355
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:45,204
This. Ends. Now.

356
00:20:59,501 --> 00:21:00,801
<i>Is everything okay?</i>

357
00:21:01,533 --> 00:21:05,246
Everything is just fine.

358
00:21:10,116 --> 00:21:11,930
Who's the idiot now?

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
