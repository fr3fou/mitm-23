<i>While Betty kept the fat man occupied,
I ducked down the hallway to his office.

2
00:00:05,978 --> 00:00:10,926
<i>If I found his phone records, they would
prove that he was the one who called the
police station on the night of the murder.

3
00:00:12,128 --> 00:00:16,392
<i>All I knew was, the next person
through that door would be the
man who killed my partner.

4
00:00:16,895 --> 00:00:18,751
<i>"Hello, McKendrick,"
I heard from behind me.

5
00:00:19,097 --> 00:00:21,277
<i>I spun around,
but standing there was...

6
00:00:21,936 --> 00:00:27,628
<i>A stupid housewife who wouldn't
let her son buy nunchaks even
though they're totally safe.

00:00:27,681 --> 00:00:28,416

11
00:01:12,995 --> 00:01:15,271
All right, Reese,
you're busted.

12
00:01:15,301 --> 00:01:17,413
Of all the stupid...
Come on, front and center.

13
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,385
Now, don't blame yourself.

14
00:01:24,564 --> 00:01:27,091
Dewey, you were smoking?

15
00:01:27,465 --> 00:01:31,137
Do you have any idea what a dangerous,
disgusting addiction that is?

16
00:01:31,233 --> 00:01:32,969
It took me years to quit!

17
00:01:33,103 --> 00:01:35,402
Do you want to end up breathing
through a hole in your neck?

18
00:01:35,407 --> 00:01:36,556
Do you think that's cool?

19
00:01:36,747 --> 00:01:38,677
You can breathe through
a hole in your neck?

20
00:01:38,771 --> 00:01:40,408
What do you think your mother's
gonna say about this?

21
00:01:40,427 --> 00:01:42,085
You can't tell Mom!
She'll kill me!

22
00:01:42,088 --> 00:01:43,482
Well, you should've
thought of that earlier.

23
00:01:43,529 --> 00:01:45,381
Where would you even
get cigarettes anyway?

24
00:01:45,496 --> 00:01:47,599
There's, like, 20 cartons
hidden in your shop vac.

25
00:01:48,207 --> 00:01:51,564
Oh, my God. That is my
stash from ten years ago.

26
00:01:52,223 --> 00:01:53,535
Lois would kill me if...

27
00:01:56,061 --> 00:02:00,846
All right, Dewey, under the
circumstances, I am giving
you your one free pass.

28
00:02:00,895 --> 00:02:01,918
-Free pass?
-That's right.

29
00:02:01,931 --> 00:02:07,668
I have given each of your brothers one
free pass, one time that I didn't tell
your mother about something they did.

30
00:02:08,053 --> 00:02:10,715
All right, Francis,
this is your one free pass!

31
00:02:14,568 --> 00:02:17,095
Okay, Reese,
but this is your one!

32
00:02:22,376 --> 00:02:25,598
Okay, Malcolm,
this is your one!

33
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:28,137
Please make this
my one free pass.

34
00:02:28,195 --> 00:02:28,755
All right.

35
00:02:29,055 --> 00:02:30,386
We've got some
paperwork to sign.

36
00:02:32,192 --> 00:02:32,752
<i>Chair.

37
00:02:33,562 --> 00:02:34,141
Book.

38
00:02:34,628 --> 00:02:35,400
<i>Window.

39
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:36,431
Mama.

40
00:02:36,572 --> 00:02:39,704
Come on, Jamie,
you can talk, just one word.

41
00:02:40,401 --> 00:02:42,426
Hal, has Jamie said anything
in front of you yet?

42
00:02:43,181 --> 00:02:46,285
Whatever he said, he's a liar, Lois!
He hasn't seen anything.

43
00:02:46,303 --> 00:02:47,431
What are you talking about?

44
00:02:48,929 --> 00:02:49,913
What are you talking about?

45
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:52,015
I'm worried about Jamie. He's...

46
00:02:52,169 --> 00:02:54,381
However old he is, and
he hasn't said a word yet.

47
00:02:54,705 --> 00:02:56,289
I thought that's what
we liked about him.

48
00:02:57,033 --> 00:02:59,665
You know,
it's probably his filthy ears.

49
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:02,267
I bet he's all plugged up with
wax and he can't hear anything.

50
00:03:02,281 --> 00:03:03,111
I don't think so.

51
00:03:03,286 --> 00:03:05,639
Relax, honey. Kids go at their own pace.

52
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,968
Heck, in sixth grade, I had
a full beard, and I still couldn't
tie my shoes properly.

53
00:03:13,747 --> 00:03:14,805
Ah. There you are.

54
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:17,467
Stevie, you ran off without
your backup inhaler.

55
00:03:17,896 --> 00:03:20,203
Thanks... Dad.

56
00:03:20,761 --> 00:03:23,327
-Did Stevie tell you his big news?
-No. What's going on?

57
00:03:23,456 --> 00:03:28,235
Stevie's been accepted as
a research subject at the
Norvet Biomedical Institute.

58
00:03:28,243 --> 00:03:32,405
Dr. Norvet himself picked him
for the motor-neuropathy program.

59
00:03:32,749 --> 00:03:34,737
It's... nothing.

60
00:03:34,751 --> 00:03:35,483
Nothing?

61
00:03:35,672 --> 00:03:40,483
Come on, Stevie. This is the most exciting
thing that's happened to us since
they put your stomach on the inside.

62
00:03:40,798 --> 00:03:41,434
Who knows?

63
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:44,916
This Christmas might just
be our first ski vacation.

64
00:03:45,276 --> 00:03:45,778
Dad...

65
00:03:45,836 --> 00:03:47,958
Tomorrow after school we'll
go look at snowboards.

66
00:03:48,093 --> 00:03:50,312
-Dad...
-I said just look.

67
00:03:57,098 --> 00:03:57,909
My desk!

68
00:03:58,355 --> 00:03:59,763
Reese! What's your problem?

69
00:03:59,847 --> 00:04:01,129
He's my problem.

70
00:04:01,463 --> 00:04:05,245
I get to come home to my own room
and put my own stuff on my own desk.

71
00:04:06,064 --> 00:04:07,684
There's such a thing
as manners, Stevie.

72
00:04:07,742 --> 00:04:09,344
When you're a guest
in someone's house...

73
00:04:16,112 --> 00:04:17,568
Real classy, Reese.

74
00:04:17,576 --> 00:04:18,473
Go ahead, hit him.

75
00:04:18,531 --> 00:04:19,534
It's not fair!

76
00:04:19,731 --> 00:04:21,255
He's hit me plenty of times.

77
00:04:21,371 --> 00:04:23,358
He makes fun of me,
he treats me like crap,

78
00:04:23,542 --> 00:04:25,702
and just because he's in that
chair he gets away with it!

79
00:04:26,296 --> 00:04:27,376
I blame...

80
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:29,090
society.

81
00:04:32,133 --> 00:04:33,078
Sorry, Stevie.

82
00:04:33,211 --> 00:04:33,693
Good.

83
00:04:33,751 --> 00:04:37,204
Malcolm, get your dirty
socks off this table or I'll
feed them to you for dinner!

84
00:04:37,225 --> 00:04:38,590
Like I'd taste a difference.

85
00:04:44,614 --> 00:04:45,926
I'm gonna do it anyway.

86
00:04:46,778 --> 00:04:47,356
What?

87
00:04:47,398 --> 00:04:49,019
I'm gonna beat you up anyway.

88
00:04:49,174 --> 00:04:52,205
This Friday after school,
we're gonna go somewhere private

89
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:55,476
and I'm gonna beat you so bad your
wheelchair's gonna need a wheelchair.

90
00:04:55,825 --> 00:04:58,902
I want you to think about that
for a few days. Picture it.

91
00:04:59,648 --> 00:05:01,925
Dream about it, like I'm doing.

92
00:05:02,224 --> 00:05:05,196
Even if you tell on me, I will
find some way to make this happen.

93
00:05:06,045 --> 00:05:09,036
So you might as well have some
dignity and keep your mouth shut.

94
00:05:10,461 --> 00:05:13,471
Your ass might not know
I'm kicking it, but I will.

95
00:05:16,042 --> 00:05:16,776
Here you go.

96
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,111
All right, Jamie.

97
00:05:20,311 --> 00:05:22,680
The doctor said there's no
physical reason you can't talk,

98
00:05:22,683 --> 00:05:24,610
so that is exactly what
you are going to do.

99
00:05:24,977 --> 00:05:25,441
Talk.

100
00:05:26,074 --> 00:05:28,972
He said the best way to get you started
is for me to talk to you constantly

101
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:32,340
about everything happening around you so
that you live in a more verbal world.

102
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:35,149
That means Mommy's going to
narrate everything she's doing

103
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:37,755
like right now when she's going
over here to make you a snack.

104
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:42,199
Then it'll be time to do the laundry,
and after that she gets to make
dinner for the whole family.

105
00:05:42,431 --> 00:05:47,757
Who will wolf it down in ten seconds and leave
her to do the dishes by herself before she gets to
make the boys' lunches for school the next day.

106
00:05:47,781 --> 00:05:50,117
Then she'll get ready for
bed after everybody else.

107
00:05:50,414 --> 00:05:52,991
And discover that the bathroom
is a swampy, hairy mess,

108
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,630
and Mommy gets to spend
her last waking minutes with
a sponge and a can of cleanser.

109
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:59,521
Then it'll be time to wake up in the
morning and she'll do it all over again.

110
00:05:59,594 --> 00:06:02,346
Day after day, week after week,
for the next 30 years until Mommy dies.

111
00:06:02,385 --> 00:06:04,131
And with Mommy's luck,
even that won't be the end of it...

112
00:06:10,087 --> 00:06:11,843
Dewey! Get out here right now.

113
00:06:12,688 --> 00:06:15,505
You're smoking again after we
talked about this last week?

114
00:06:15,802 --> 00:06:17,307
You know what that does to you.

115
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:18,635
I'm cutting back.

116
00:06:19,025 --> 00:06:19,932
Cutting back?

117
00:06:20,249 --> 00:06:21,696
How many cigarettes
are you smoking?

118
00:06:21,743 --> 00:06:23,113
Under two packs a day.

119
00:06:24,628 --> 00:06:25,577
What?!

120
00:06:25,847 --> 00:06:27,447
How is that even possible?

121
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,198
I got rid of the
cartons in the garage.

122
00:06:29,217 --> 00:06:31,436
Well, you didn't get rid of the
ones hidden in the crawlspace.

123
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:33,592
Or the rain gutters,
or under the ivy.

124
00:06:33,828 --> 00:06:35,989
There's thousands of cigarettes
hidden all over the place.

125
00:06:36,027 --> 00:06:38,577
How could you spend all that
money and not even smoke them?

126
00:06:38,674 --> 00:06:40,507
I could have gone
to private school.

127
00:06:40,822 --> 00:06:42,048
Keep it down.

128
00:06:44,011 --> 00:06:47,078
Look, Dewey, I'm sorry,
but I had such a hard time quitting.

129
00:06:47,094 --> 00:06:51,685
The only way I could do it
without freaking out was
knowing they were there.

130
00:06:52,149 --> 00:06:55,120
-I know it sounds crazy.
-I'll tell you what's crazy.

131
00:06:55,282 --> 00:06:59,005
Being hooked on these stupid
things even though I hate the
way they taste and smell.

132
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:00,529
Well, those are really stale.

133
00:07:00,568 --> 00:07:02,343
You're not getting
the fresh, rich flavor...

134
00:07:03,096 --> 00:07:03,887
Never mind!

135
00:07:04,097 --> 00:07:05,901
The point is,
you can beat this.

136
00:07:05,994 --> 00:07:07,075
We'll do it together.

137
00:07:07,253 --> 00:07:09,221
Listen, you know how much
I love coffee, right?

138
00:07:09,288 --> 00:07:11,178
Yeah, I've seen you
drink it in the shower.

139
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:13,804
Exactly. I must drink
three pots a day, easy.

140
00:07:14,087 --> 00:07:17,579
Well, I'm willing to give it up for you,
cold turkey, if you give up smoking.

141
00:07:17,956 --> 00:07:19,144
-Really?
-Absolutely.

142
00:07:19,595 --> 00:07:20,943
That way we're both suffering.

143
00:07:21,095 --> 00:07:24,683
We both know what the other's going
through and we can support each other.

144
00:07:25,306 --> 00:07:27,833
You and me, Dewey.
We'll be a team.

145
00:07:28,547 --> 00:07:29,897
That sounds great, Dad.

146
00:07:31,211 --> 00:07:33,372
Just let me have one more to get it
out of my system. We can start...

147
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:35,494
-Dewey.
-All right.

148
00:07:39,796 --> 00:07:41,571
Come on, Stevie, pay attention.

149
00:07:41,734 --> 00:07:43,218
You just had Hitler
invade Malibu.

150
00:07:43,872 --> 00:07:44,462
Sorry.

151
00:07:44,656 --> 00:07:45,563
What's up with you lately?

152
00:07:46,228 --> 00:07:47,150
Hi, guys.

153
00:07:47,212 --> 00:07:48,736
Hey, Reese, how'd it
go with the principal?

154
00:07:48,807 --> 00:07:49,588
Fantastic.

155
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,115
I love when they get old and
they start just phoning it in.

156
00:07:52,288 --> 00:07:55,761
He's actually willing to believe
this is from obsessive hand washing.

157
00:07:59,737 --> 00:08:02,029
Reese took out Scotty
Riselli today. It was brutal.

158
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:02,955
You should have seen it.

159
00:08:03,266 --> 00:08:06,913
He hit him so hard, a few times he
actually lifted him up in the air.

160
00:08:07,064 --> 00:08:09,978
And the blood was, I mean,
there's always blood,

161
00:08:10,001 --> 00:08:12,992
but Scotty was like one of
those big sprinklers, you know?

162
00:08:14,602 --> 00:08:16,823
And once he went down,
Reese went to work on him.

163
00:08:16,977 --> 00:08:19,022
Did you know he
had dental tools?

164
00:08:19,961 --> 00:08:21,408
Hey, I get Africa.

165
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:24,102
Can I...

166
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:26,123
ask you something?

167
00:08:26,156 --> 00:08:26,600
Sure.

168
00:08:27,214 --> 00:08:28,193
Do you find...

169
00:08:29,025 --> 00:08:30,392
my personality...

170
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:32,331
abrasive?

171
00:08:32,558 --> 00:08:33,099
What?

172
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:34,805
Do you think...

173
00:08:35,526 --> 00:08:36,876
I'm needlessly...

174
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:38,828
antagonistic?

175
00:08:40,211 --> 00:08:41,891
I don't know. Probably.
What do you care?

176
00:08:42,953 --> 00:08:43,879
I don't...

177
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:45,674
want anyone...

178
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:47,625
to hate me.

179
00:08:50,082 --> 00:08:51,336
It's Lisa Filmore, isn't it?

180
00:08:51,903 --> 00:08:52,403
Who?

181
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:53,702
I saw you checking her out.

182
00:08:54,174 --> 00:08:56,391
You like the big
stuff, huh? Nice.

183
00:08:56,503 --> 00:08:58,930
Little jiggly-wiggly,
little wabbal-abbal-abbal-abbal...

184
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,058
You're... a jerk.

185
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:02,726
I'm just being supportive.
I'm sorry.

186
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,807
Come on.
Let's just finish the game.

187
00:09:05,018 --> 00:09:05,716
Can't.

188
00:09:06,781 --> 00:09:07,823
Today's our...

189
00:09:08,633 --> 00:09:09,617
first meeting...

190
00:09:10,945 --> 00:09:12,423
at the Norvet Institute.

191
00:09:12,683 --> 00:09:13,320
Okay, wait.

192
00:09:13,608 --> 00:09:15,248
There's something good
about your personality.

193
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:20,435
You completely humor your dad with all
his idiotic plans for you to walk, no matter
how pointless and stupid it is to try.

194
00:09:20,507 --> 00:09:22,147
You're never, like,
"Dad, wake up."

195
00:09:22,157 --> 00:09:25,083
"I'm never getting out of this
wheelchair. I'm going to be
a cripple till the day I die."

196
00:09:25,214 --> 00:09:27,548
I mean, you know it,
but you don't throw it in his face.

197
00:09:27,761 --> 00:09:29,147
That's a really nice quality.

198
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:30,961
There, better?

199
00:09:32,882 --> 00:09:37,583
And so I spend all this time every morning
on my hair, trying to get it just so,
although I know no one else notices.

200
00:09:37,585 --> 00:09:39,457
It's such a stupid
vanity thing.

201
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:43,780
I don't know why I'm so neurotic
about my hair. You know, it's just
ridiculous if you think about it.

202
00:09:44,097 --> 00:09:46,756
<i>Wish I could let it go,
but it's like I just can't help myself.

203
00:09:49,844 --> 00:09:51,750
Slow down. You haven't had breakfast yet.

204
00:09:51,848 --> 00:09:54,529
Well, if you got me the nicotine
gum like I asked, then...

205
00:10:02,829 --> 00:10:03,535
You okay?

206
00:10:03,658 --> 00:10:06,393
Oh, that? That's nothing,
Lois. That's just...

207
00:10:06,865 --> 00:10:07,436
puberty.

208
00:10:07,431 --> 00:10:09,170
You know,
when a boy's lungs drop.

209
00:10:09,213 --> 00:10:11,463
This is how it hits all
the men in my family.

210
00:10:11,579 --> 00:10:15,999
Hacking cough, dark circles under
the eyes, yellowing fingers.

211
00:10:20,144 --> 00:10:23,240
So, there I am, 13 years old,
flat-chested as I can be,

212
00:10:23,244 --> 00:10:26,486
everyone around me is sprouting, and
I'm feeling just horrible about myself.

213
00:10:27,334 --> 00:10:27,976
And why?

214
00:10:28,691 --> 00:10:29,631
No reason at all.

215
00:10:30,154 --> 00:10:32,589
I'm getting straight A's,
I'm running the food drive,

216
00:10:32,595 --> 00:10:38,297
I'm all-county on the gymnastics team,
and none of this means anything to me
because I'm so fixated on my bustline.

217
00:10:40,618 --> 00:10:44,394
And so like an idiot, I started
stuffing my bra with toilet paper.

218
00:10:45,653 --> 00:10:49,182
Even after all these years, I remember
every morning in the bathroom,

219
00:10:49,187 --> 00:10:54,064
shoving these things down my
shirt and feeling like such an
awkward, ugly, little girl.

220
00:10:58,347 --> 00:10:59,365
Thank you.

221
00:11:01,817 --> 00:11:05,941
Of course in second-period
Spanish I had to sit next to
the snooty Janice Montgomery

222
00:11:05,963 --> 00:11:11,500
with her tangerine nail polish, which I was
dying to try, but of course she wouldn't let
me because I had drugstore shoes.

223
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:12,920
Hey, Mom.

224
00:11:13,604 --> 00:11:14,654
Look at these stains.

225
00:11:16,054 --> 00:11:17,703
You boys are in
so much trouble.

226
00:11:17,891 --> 00:11:19,648
No more pillowcases
for a month.

227
00:11:20,938 --> 00:11:22,115
Okay...

228
00:11:57,092 --> 00:11:58,275
Fixing something?

229
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:00,188
Dad.

230
00:12:01,177 --> 00:12:01,667
Hi.

231
00:12:02,422 --> 00:12:04,996
I'm so disappointed
in you, son.

232
00:12:05,297 --> 00:12:06,593
We had an agreement.

233
00:12:08,376 --> 00:12:09,051
What was that?

234
00:12:09,936 --> 00:12:10,650
What was what?

235
00:12:14,914 --> 00:12:16,651
All right,
we both have a problem.

236
00:12:16,963 --> 00:12:18,875
This is so degrading.

237
00:12:18,887 --> 00:12:22,168
On the way home from school,
I almost pulled a cigarette
butt out of the gutter.

238
00:12:22,275 --> 00:12:25,787
I French-kissed your mother this morning
just to lick the coffee off her teeth.

239
00:12:26,046 --> 00:12:31,114
But we can do this. We just need
to find a way to divert our minds
when the pangs get too bad.

240
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:41,950
Hal, what are you doing?

241
00:12:42,741 --> 00:12:43,968
What's it look like I'm doing?

242
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:46,849
Can't a father have a friendly
game of catch with his son?!

243
00:12:46,911 --> 00:12:47,915
We're having fun!

244
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:57,786
I had that dream
again last night.

245
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:00,251
Cheerleading tryouts.

246
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:03,999
Like it wasn't bad enough it
happened, I have to relive it
for the rest of my life.

247
00:13:04,928 --> 00:13:08,400
I was so excited to think
that I might be a Cougar,

248
00:13:08,922 --> 00:13:10,479
and finally feel
like I belonged.

249
00:13:10,936 --> 00:13:13,740
The routine was nothing, I'd done
that stuff in gymnastics for years.

250
00:13:13,756 --> 00:13:17,153
And still, I practiced that routine for
weeks making sure that it was perfect.

251
00:13:18,761 --> 00:13:21,810
The day of the tryouts,
I borrowed my sister's good sweater,

252
00:13:21,991 --> 00:13:26,280
spent about an hour on my hair,
stuffed my bra, even shoved
a little extra in there for luck.

253
00:13:27,096 --> 00:13:29,488
And when I got down to the gym,
I found out I had to go first,

254
00:13:29,498 --> 00:13:32,372
in front of the whole squad and
everyone else who was trying out.

255
00:13:33,206 --> 00:13:35,965
So I just pretended to
be braver than I was.

256
00:13:35,969 --> 00:13:38,777
I smiled real big, and I went out
there and I started my routine.

257
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,746
I did a round-off, a cartwheel,
a kip-up, it was going great,
I was so happy.

258
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:52,019
I landed my back-flip dead solid
perfect. I threw up my arms, and
instead of everybody cheering...

259
00:13:53,655 --> 00:13:55,140
everybody was laughing.

260
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:02,241
And I looked down, and there
was a 30-foot-long trail of toilet
paper along the tumbling mat.

261
00:14:04,146 --> 00:14:08,916
Everything I worked for,
everything I wanted so desperately...

262
00:14:09,359 --> 00:14:12,735
ruined because of my vanity.

263
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,426
And you know what
the worst part is?

264
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,748
I didn't even learn anything.

265
00:14:21,824 --> 00:14:24,988
Deep down, I'm still just
as shallow as I was then.

266
00:14:25,592 --> 00:14:32,184
All that fussing and primping and
time I wasted to shut out laughter
that stopped 30 years ago.

267
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:33,251
It's disgusting.

268
00:14:33,329 --> 00:14:37,188
If I had any guts I would just
cut off my hair right now.

269
00:14:37,304 --> 00:14:39,561
You know, just face
it down, and beat it!

270
00:14:48,266 --> 00:14:49,315
You gonna get that?

271
00:14:49,701 --> 00:14:50,742
I can't.

272
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,336
Malcolm. It's Abe.

273
00:14:54,433 --> 00:14:55,243
Where's your brother?

274
00:14:55,378 --> 00:14:57,590
Reese? I don't know, probably
pounding the snot out of someone.

275
00:14:57,609 --> 00:14:58,388
It's Stevie!

276
00:14:58,551 --> 00:14:59,815
-You've got to stop it!
-What?

277
00:14:59,827 --> 00:15:00,750
What are you talking about?

278
00:15:00,769 --> 00:15:03,928
Stevie and I were in the middle of
our session at the Norvet Institute,

279
00:15:04,064 --> 00:15:07,634
and then he said he had to go
fight Reese, and just took off!

280
00:15:07,664 --> 00:15:09,149
-I'm terrified that...
-Oh, no.

281
00:15:16,771 --> 00:15:18,045
Reese, what are you doing?

282
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,167
Something I should've
done years ago.

283
00:15:20,963 --> 00:15:23,201
I've been numbing my legs
in ice for an hour now.

284
00:15:23,259 --> 00:15:23,626
What?

285
00:15:23,722 --> 00:15:25,225
I can't feel a
thing down there.

286
00:15:27,112 --> 00:15:28,327
See? Nothing.

287
00:15:28,584 --> 00:15:30,610
First three times I did
that it hurt like hell.

288
00:15:30,927 --> 00:15:33,609
Nobody's gonna say this
wasn't a fair fight.

289
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,827
When Stevie gets here,
I'm gonna flop over to him like a fish,

290
00:15:36,957 --> 00:15:41,353
yank him out of his chair, and
smash his face in, gimp-to-gimp.

291
00:15:44,316 --> 00:15:45,532
Reese, you're insane!

292
00:15:45,754 --> 00:15:46,468
Am I?

293
00:15:47,047 --> 00:15:51,430
They thought Einstein was crazy...
until he started kicking ass.

294
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:56,245
Hey. Where's Mom?

295
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:01,074
She's locked in her room with Jamie.
She's been there for hours.

296
00:16:01,091 --> 00:16:05,867
Oh. Listen, I'm sorry I snapped
at you. I was just agitated,
but I'm feeling better now.

297
00:16:05,889 --> 00:16:07,873
Hey, I really think
we're over the hump.

298
00:16:07,995 --> 00:16:09,389
We're still a team, okay?

299
00:16:09,729 --> 00:16:10,559
Good boy.

300
00:16:22,098 --> 00:16:23,236
What are you doing?!

301
00:16:23,274 --> 00:16:23,683
What?

302
00:16:24,287 --> 00:16:25,572
Oh, this. It's nothing.

303
00:16:25,579 --> 00:16:26,951
It's keeping me calm.

304
00:16:26,961 --> 00:16:27,908
But we're quitting!

305
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:29,188
No, I'm quitting coffee.

306
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:30,426
You're quitting cigarettes.

307
00:16:30,608 --> 00:16:31,462
That's cheating!

308
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:33,199
You do not get to do this.

309
00:16:33,232 --> 00:16:36,294
Actually, Dewey, I get to do whatever
I want, because I am a grown-up.

310
00:16:36,891 --> 00:16:39,058
All right,
if that's how you want it.

311
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:40,743
Dewey!

312
00:16:40,754 --> 00:16:41,528
What are you doing?

313
00:16:42,446 --> 00:16:42,928
Dewey!

314
00:16:45,856 --> 00:16:47,882
Don't you dare!

315
00:16:51,509 --> 00:16:54,962
The smooth,
wonderful taste of betrayal!

316
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:55,849
Oh, yeah?

317
00:16:56,744 --> 00:16:59,252
Well, I'm in flavor
country, baby!

318
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:07,196
This is good.

319
00:17:07,255 --> 00:17:08,233
This is growth.

320
00:17:08,282 --> 00:17:09,142
Just do it.

321
00:17:09,241 --> 00:17:10,426
Don't be such a chicken.

322
00:17:10,565 --> 00:17:12,167
It's the only way
to stop hearing it.

323
00:17:12,426 --> 00:17:16,815
All those kids laughing, my mother
coming to the nurse's office
telling me to stop blubbering,

324
00:17:16,823 --> 00:17:20,068
she wouldn't have to stuff my bra if
I wasn't too lazy to grow them myself.

325
00:17:23,363 --> 00:17:24,521
Oh, my God.

326
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,520
It was my mother.

327
00:17:27,675 --> 00:17:31,610
She was the one stuffing
my bra. Oh, my God.

328
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:36,579
She was the one making me feel
so horrible and inadequate. Not me.

329
00:17:36,607 --> 00:17:38,592
This wasn't about
vanity, Jamie.

330
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:43,357
This is about an abusive old
bat trying to make her kid into
something that she wasn't.

331
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:48,572
Well, I am not going to
be that kind of mother.

332
00:17:48,635 --> 00:17:52,147
If you don't feel like talking yet,
then you don't have to talk.

333
00:17:52,337 --> 00:17:55,003
I'm going to love you
exactly the way you are.

334
00:18:00,877 --> 00:18:02,189
Shut up!

335
00:18:03,683 --> 00:18:05,574
Mm. Rich, roasted goodness!

336
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:08,046
Suddenly I'm at a French cafe.

337
00:18:08,056 --> 00:18:13,379
Well, I'm with two girls in
a speedboat, sucking down
a smooth blend of fine tobaccos.

338
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:14,930
Hal!

339
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:17,636
Dewey's drinking coffee!

340
00:18:25,357 --> 00:18:27,717
I think crippling my legs
made my arms stronger.

341
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,474
Like how blind guys
have bigger noses.

342
00:18:29,642 --> 00:18:30,819
This is gonna be great.

343
00:18:30,857 --> 00:18:33,139
Reese, you can't do this.
Stevie's our friend.

344
00:18:33,201 --> 00:18:35,338
Hey, he's not my friend.
He's your friend.

345
00:18:35,529 --> 00:18:36,841
He treats me like crap.

346
00:18:37,121 --> 00:18:39,050
He insults me and
disrespects me...

347
00:18:40,155 --> 00:18:41,138
and you let him.

348
00:18:41,264 --> 00:18:41,707
What?

349
00:18:41,804 --> 00:18:45,744
You always take his side. You
always do everything his way,
even though we're brothers.

350
00:18:46,509 --> 00:18:48,862
Wait. Are you jealous?

351
00:18:48,966 --> 00:18:50,838
No, I'm pissed.

352
00:18:51,173 --> 00:18:53,353
You and Stevie are going to
be friends your whole life,

353
00:18:53,637 --> 00:18:56,300
but once you go away to college
and you're not stuck with us,

354
00:18:56,359 --> 00:18:57,670
we're never gonna
see you again.

355
00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:01,865
But even so, you're spending the rest of
the time left with Stevie instead of...

356
00:19:07,097 --> 00:19:08,493
Do I have to tell
you I love you?

357
00:19:08,824 --> 00:19:09,691
No.

358
00:19:10,145 --> 00:19:10,743
Good.

359
00:19:14,644 --> 00:19:17,268
Dude, like you said,
we're brothers.

360
00:19:17,857 --> 00:19:20,462
It doesn't matter if I don't
want to be here, I'm stuck here.

361
00:19:21,102 --> 00:19:24,844
No matter where I go or what I do, we're
always going to be forced together.

362
00:19:24,974 --> 00:19:26,654
Christmas, birthdays...

363
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:30,063
We're going to be forced to be around
each other for the rest of our lives.

364
00:19:30,509 --> 00:19:31,126
Really?

365
00:19:34,734 --> 00:19:35,680
What was that?

366
00:19:36,048 --> 00:19:36,800
I don't know.

367
00:19:54,994 --> 00:19:58,929
You're... mine!

368
00:20:00,897 --> 00:20:02,962
Good news, Stevie. I forgive you.

369
00:20:04,741 --> 00:20:05,687
Come on, Stevie!

370
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:07,901
I can't walk. This isn't fair!

371
00:20:08,176 --> 00:20:10,182
Don't reduce yourself to my level!

372
00:20:10,514 --> 00:20:11,807
You're better than this!

373
00:20:24,316 --> 00:20:25,280
God, I'm too late!

374
00:20:25,526 --> 00:20:27,075
Stevie, please stop!

375
00:20:27,081 --> 00:20:28,101
Think of the lawsuit!

376
00:20:28,106 --> 00:20:30,846
You know these people will do
anything to get our money!

377
00:20:34,307 --> 00:20:38,243
The Norvet Institute kicked Stevie
out of their program for unauthorized
use of their equipment.

378
00:20:38,567 --> 00:20:42,293
And Reese will be okay, but he's
not allowed out of bed until he
stops seeing four of everything.

379
00:20:55,602 --> 00:20:58,515
Mom's making Dad find every
last one of his old cigarettes.

380
00:20:58,554 --> 00:21:01,834
She's going to make him eat
any she finds tomorrow morning,
so he's pretty motivated.

381
00:21:02,533 --> 00:21:05,331
The amazing thing is I'm the only
one that got off scott-free.

382
00:21:05,761 --> 00:21:07,895
Malcolm, go change
Reese's bedpan.

383
00:21:09,238 --> 00:21:10,588
Hey. He's my brother.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
