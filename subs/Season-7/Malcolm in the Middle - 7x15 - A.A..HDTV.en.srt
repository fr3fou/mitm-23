1
00:00:03,311 --> 00:00:05,166
Mom, Reese is poking me!

2
00:00:05,298 --> 00:00:06,100
That's it, you two.

3
00:00:06,376 --> 00:00:07,954
Either side of the couch, now!

4
00:00:10,057 --> 00:00:11,358
He's still poking me!

5
00:00:11,371 --> 00:00:12,893
Reese, go to your room!

6
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:14,949
I don't want you within 30 feet of him!

7
00:00:29,155 --> 00:00:35,155
Malcolm in the Middle
7.15 - "A.A."

& Malcolm-France.com

10
00:01:03,711 --> 00:01:05,606
Come on, Hal!
We're going to be late.

11
00:01:05,613 --> 00:01:07,738
Fine, but I don't see
what the big deal is.

12
00:01:07,961 --> 00:01:09,848
So what if he stopped
drinking for a year?

13
00:01:10,395 --> 00:01:12,266
I thought that's what you're
supposed to do in AA.

14
00:01:12,268 --> 00:01:15,887
Francis' one-year anniversary of
sobriety is very important to him.

15
00:01:15,903 --> 00:01:19,362
Sounds to me like it was just dreamed
up by the greeting card companies.

16
00:01:19,663 --> 00:01:21,292
What is wrong with you?

17
00:01:21,804 --> 00:01:24,744
Francis has joined AA, and
is turning his life around.

18
00:01:24,808 --> 00:01:27,572
These are the people who helped him
do that, and he wants us to meet them.

19
00:01:27,573 --> 00:01:29,904
Where were they when he
needed to learn to ride a bicycle?

20
00:01:29,944 --> 00:01:31,359
Or when he lost his first tooth?

21
00:01:31,464 --> 00:01:33,367
We did all the heavy lifting.

22
00:01:33,558 --> 00:01:34,823
And now these guys get all the glory.

23
00:01:34,825 --> 00:01:36,493
I can't believe you're
jealous of these people.

24
00:01:36,648 --> 00:01:37,762
Well, what does he need us for?

25
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:40,183
He's got them now.
We're useless.

26
00:01:40,323 --> 00:01:41,440
We're like his appendix.

27
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:43,933
Now he's just going to
open up his stomach,

28
00:01:43,991 --> 00:01:46,144
remove us, and put us
in a jar up on a shelf,

29
00:01:46,413 --> 00:01:47,597
<i>right there in the living room...</i>

30
00:01:47,803 --> 00:01:48,261
or the...

31
00:01:48,915 --> 00:01:49,638
den, or...

32
00:01:50,275 --> 00:01:51,698
a mantlepiece, if he's got one.

33
00:01:52,856 --> 00:01:54,052
I'm gonna go wait in the car.

34
00:01:54,843 --> 00:01:55,645
Where's Jamie?

35
00:01:56,739 --> 00:01:57,364
There he is.

36
00:01:57,519 --> 00:01:59,495
He's been dying to go to
that sitter's all morning.

37
00:01:59,918 --> 00:02:02,308
I swear that woman feeds him
nothing but sugar all day long.

38
00:02:03,674 --> 00:02:04,850
I'm coming!

39
00:02:06,551 --> 00:02:07,904
Bye, Mom. Say hi to Francis.

40
00:02:08,094 --> 00:02:10,362
Oh, wait, wait, all right.
You've got your food money.

41
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:12,240
You've got your emergency numbers.

42
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:13,603
We'll be home Sunday
night around 9:00.

43
00:02:13,807 --> 00:02:14,696
But before I forget.

44
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:19,287
This is the one thing left in
this house that I care about.

45
00:02:19,321 --> 00:02:21,139
I don't want to spend the
next two days worrying about

46
00:02:21,143 --> 00:02:23,461
"How will they break it, where
will they hide the pieces,

47
00:02:23,463 --> 00:02:25,338
how will they lie to me
about it when I come home."

48
00:02:25,634 --> 00:02:26,109
So...

49
00:02:28,822 --> 00:02:30,686
There. Now I can relax.

50
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:38,138
I'm bored.

51
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:41,306
Mom and Dad are gone.
You want to make some crank calls?

52
00:02:41,434 --> 00:02:41,875
Nah.

53
00:02:42,605 --> 00:02:44,343
I guess I'm getting old.
I'm really not inspired.

54
00:02:45,095 --> 00:02:46,774
We could cherry bomb
Ms. Waller's mailbox.

55
00:02:46,786 --> 00:02:47,675
What's the point?

56
00:02:47,726 --> 00:02:49,869
She'd just chase me,
have an asthma attack.

57
00:02:49,881 --> 00:02:51,460
The neighbors would call 911.

58
00:02:51,576 --> 00:02:53,499
I'd get away with it
because of her blackout.

59
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:55,315
We'd both just be going
through the motions.

60
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:56,061
You're right.

61
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,643
Terrorizing the same old
neighbors year after year just
doesn't feel satisfying anymore.

62
00:03:01,276 --> 00:03:02,343
Maybe we're growing up.

63
00:03:03,129 --> 00:03:05,438
Maybe we don't need to go out
and create random havoc.

64
00:03:05,621 --> 00:03:07,649
Hey, guys, I was digging
around in the garage,

65
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:09,940
and I found the spare
key to Dad's car!

66
00:03:11,571 --> 00:03:13,013
Do you know what this means?

67
00:03:13,412 --> 00:03:14,494
We can key stuff!

68
00:03:14,649 --> 00:03:16,317
No, we have mobility.

69
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:17,974
We can drive over
to the next city.

70
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:19,213
And key stuff there!

71
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:22,058
And key stuff there, and
cherry-bomb stuff there.

72
00:03:22,231 --> 00:03:24,993
Reese, we have access to
a car with no adult supervision.

73
00:03:25,188 --> 00:03:27,285
We can do whatever we
want, and if we get caught?

74
00:03:27,308 --> 00:03:29,571
They'd blame Mom and Dad
for being absentee parents.

75
00:03:29,767 --> 00:03:32,386
-This is the perfect crime.
-I was thinking we could
drive to the arcade.

76
00:03:33,023 --> 00:03:33,706
Arcade?

77
00:03:34,077 --> 00:03:34,978
What are you, 12?

78
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:35,918
Yeah.

79
00:03:36,016 --> 00:03:38,351
Dewey, get out of the way.
Malcolm and I have to plan some pain.

80
00:03:38,558 --> 00:03:39,440
What about South High?

81
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:41,485
I think their band practice
starts in two hours.

82
00:03:41,646 --> 00:03:43,937
Perfect. I still have some
connections at the slaughterhouse.

83
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:46,252
One phone call, and
I got a trunkful of pig's blood.

84
00:03:53,644 --> 00:03:55,327
It's humble, but it's home.

85
00:03:55,787 --> 00:03:58,546
Actually, they just walled off a
bedroom from the apartment next door...

86
00:03:59,716 --> 00:04:01,130
but anyway, it's home.

87
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:06,056
Uh, you know, Francis, your mother
and I passed a motel on the way here...

88
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:08,939
Nonsense. I won't have my
parents staying at some motel.

89
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,165
You can sleep here.

90
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,007
-On the rug?
-It's a futon.

91
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:15,636
Believe it or not, someone was
actually going to throw that away.

92
00:04:16,253 --> 00:04:17,636
You know, my back...

93
00:04:17,641 --> 00:04:18,883
Hal, let him do this.

94
00:04:19,042 --> 00:04:20,211
All righty, we'll stay.

95
00:04:20,555 --> 00:04:21,167
Great!

96
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:24,005
You know, I'm really glad you guys
came up here for my celebration.

97
00:04:24,087 --> 00:04:25,511
Speaking of which...

98
00:04:26,034 --> 00:04:27,715
-Piama!
-It's fine.

99
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,145
Really, Mom, I have a handle on it.

100
00:04:29,614 --> 00:04:31,827
Besides we're not just
celebrating my sobriety.

101
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:35,398
We're also celebrating my new job.

102
00:04:35,482 --> 00:04:37,517
Francis, that's wonderful!

103
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,615
What is it?

104
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:40,228
A laser-etched crystal.

105
00:04:40,376 --> 00:04:42,458
It's the perfect fusion
of science and art.

106
00:04:43,846 --> 00:04:45,603
The detail is amazing.

107
00:04:46,065 --> 00:04:47,998
And you can see everything
on this nude fairy.

108
00:04:48,067 --> 00:04:48,752
That's me.

109
00:04:49,743 --> 00:04:53,212
You can put whatever image
you want in these crystals, but
it all adds up to one thing:

110
00:04:53,508 --> 00:04:56,448
financial independence
in five to twelve years.

111
00:04:56,457 --> 00:04:58,110
We're starting our own business.

112
00:04:58,121 --> 00:05:00,829
We already looked into the franchise
and locked down the location.

113
00:05:01,057 --> 00:05:02,757
Now all we have to do is
work out the financing.

114
00:05:02,982 --> 00:05:03,660
Oh?

115
00:05:03,726 --> 00:05:05,443
Don't worry, Mom,
we don't need any money...

116
00:05:05,635 --> 00:05:08,426
we already got $10,000 from
Piama's mom's lawsuit settlement.

117
00:05:08,443 --> 00:05:12,520
The newspaper used her picture
without her permission for an
article on mental defectives.

118
00:05:12,785 --> 00:05:14,625
All we need from you guys
is to co-sign the loan.

119
00:05:14,631 --> 00:05:15,694
We hate to ask, but...

120
00:05:16,113 --> 00:05:18,400
you're the only people Piama
and I could turn to for this.

121
00:05:19,061 --> 00:05:20,017
Did you hear that, honey?

122
00:05:20,052 --> 00:05:21,392
He's turning to us.

123
00:05:21,813 --> 00:05:23,745
-How much?
-It's just a small business loan:

124
00:05:23,938 --> 00:05:24,910
$20,000.

125
00:05:25,032 --> 00:05:26,655
$20,000?!

126
00:05:26,672 --> 00:05:28,712
And none of your drunk friends
could help you out on this, huh?

127
00:05:28,734 --> 00:05:31,664
Not at all. Oh, and don't worry,
the bank already ran your credit.

128
00:05:32,047 --> 00:05:34,816
It's horrible, but all that means is
they just crank up the interest rate.

129
00:05:34,861 --> 00:05:36,859
In what world would you
think we would sign that?

130
00:05:37,446 --> 00:05:38,021
Honey, come here.

131
00:05:38,507 --> 00:05:39,892
Let's hear the boy out.

132
00:05:40,082 --> 00:05:41,534
You heard him; he needs us.

133
00:05:41,535 --> 00:05:45,036
Hal, I'm not going to sign anything.
We're in enough debt as it is.

134
00:05:45,063 --> 00:05:45,435
Lois...

135
00:05:45,442 --> 00:05:47,984
I hate to do this, but can
we talk about this later?

136
00:05:48,057 --> 00:05:49,509
We really got to get to my AA party.

137
00:05:49,568 --> 00:05:50,393
Of course!

138
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,403
I got to tell you, son, I am drunk
as a skunk with pride right now.

139
00:05:57,294 --> 00:05:59,748
Okay, we have 12 hours
and eight gallons of gas.

140
00:06:00,029 --> 00:06:02,220
This is our radius of destruction.

141
00:06:02,226 --> 00:06:03,979
So much to do, so little time.

142
00:06:04,209 --> 00:06:05,755
What about my old 4th grade teacher?

143
00:06:05,846 --> 00:06:07,765
If we get Mr. Bradshaw, then
we can't moon the girls' school.

144
00:06:07,769 --> 00:06:09,400
No, the mooning is a definite.

145
00:06:09,797 --> 00:06:12,121
For you to even suggest that makes
me really question your commitment.

146
00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:15,803
If I give you Bradshaw, then
I can't do donuts on the lawn
of my old basketball coach.

147
00:06:15,812 --> 00:06:17,639
-What about the arcade?
-Not now, Dewey.

148
00:06:17,937 --> 00:06:19,659
-All right, I'll give you the donuts.
-Great.

149
00:06:21,683 --> 00:06:23,894
So which way are we leaning
on the whole cat show situation?

150
00:06:24,005 --> 00:06:26,314
If you get me that coyote,
then I'll get you to the cat show.

151
00:06:26,321 --> 00:06:28,162
The arcade is on the
way to the cat show.

152
00:06:28,242 --> 00:06:28,864
Out!

153
00:06:30,052 --> 00:06:32,377
Hey, are we peeing in the
mailbox on Fifth, or aren't we?

154
00:06:32,483 --> 00:06:35,242
I've already drank three of these.
Do not embarrass me out there.

155
00:06:39,731 --> 00:06:41,643
Come on, Reese, we are so close.

156
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,333
Do you really need five minutes to
work over your old lab partner?

157
00:06:51,996 --> 00:06:52,618
Yeah.

158
00:06:52,798 --> 00:06:54,453
Why do something if you're
not gonna do it right?

159
00:06:55,956 --> 00:06:58,673
All right, do you think you could work
your boy over in the back seat of the car?

160
00:06:58,730 --> 00:06:59,547
What are you getting at?

161
00:06:59,563 --> 00:07:01,187
After we push over those gravestones,

162
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:02,572
we can pick up the lab partner.

163
00:07:02,684 --> 00:07:04,585
By the time you're done with
him, we're at the promenade,

164
00:07:04,605 --> 00:07:06,697
where we do our
pedestrian-only drive through.

165
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:10,783
Then it's a straight shot down
45th street, just in time for the
old folks' health walk.

166
00:07:11,085 --> 00:07:12,331
A quick streak, and dude...

167
00:07:12,782 --> 00:07:13,399
we're done!

168
00:07:13,417 --> 00:07:14,422
-Yeah!
-Ah!

169
00:07:15,713 --> 00:07:16,717
All right, we have to get going.

170
00:07:16,972 --> 00:07:17,851
We need the car key.

171
00:07:18,202 --> 00:07:19,306
Are we going to the arcade?

172
00:07:19,341 --> 00:07:21,260
We already told you we don't
have time for that, Dewey.

173
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,440
You know something?

174
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:24,791
I don't remember where I put it.

175
00:07:25,277 --> 00:07:27,269
Stupid! How could you misplace it?!

176
00:07:28,552 --> 00:07:30,266
Wait a minute... he's lying.

177
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:32,113
Dewey, give us the key now!

178
00:07:32,198 --> 00:07:33,007
Nope.

179
00:07:33,905 --> 00:07:35,954
All right, Dewey, we can
either do this the easy...

180
00:07:37,604 --> 00:07:38,591
No fair.

181
00:07:39,092 --> 00:07:40,534
That's just what I was going to do.

182
00:07:45,406 --> 00:07:46,133
Crash!

183
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:48,647
Frankie, my man!

184
00:07:50,849 --> 00:07:52,716
-Little Miss P.
-Hey, baby.

185
00:07:53,018 --> 00:07:54,227
Crash, I'd like you
to meet my dad.

186
00:07:54,351 --> 00:07:54,720
<i>Hello.</i>

187
00:07:56,326 --> 00:07:57,414
Stay strong, brother.

188
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:58,534
Okay.

189
00:07:59,311 --> 00:08:00,144
And this is my mother.

190
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:05,144
She's real?

191
00:08:05,405 --> 00:08:06,016
Excuse me?

192
00:08:07,372 --> 00:08:08,012
It's...

193
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:09,777
I thought...

194
00:08:12,222 --> 00:08:13,366
I don't know what I thought.

195
00:08:13,855 --> 00:08:15,380
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

196
00:08:19,149 --> 00:08:20,335
What was that all about?

197
00:08:25,809 --> 00:08:26,751
<i>Give it up, Dewey!</i>

198
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:28,132
<i>No!</i>

199
00:08:30,548 --> 00:08:32,099
-Tell us where the key is!
-No!

200
00:08:38,736 --> 00:08:39,964
Tell us where the key is!

201
00:08:40,349 --> 00:08:40,958
No.

202
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:45,188
-Give us the key.
-No.

203
00:08:49,855 --> 00:08:50,969
That was our last worm!

204
00:08:51,003 --> 00:08:53,270
-It's no use; he's immune.
-It's our own fault...

205
00:08:53,329 --> 00:08:55,732
we've been torturing him since Mom
brought him home from the hospital.

206
00:08:56,065 --> 00:08:57,092
Remember when he was a baby?

207
00:08:57,702 --> 00:08:59,453
I could make him cry, just like that.

208
00:08:59,547 --> 00:09:00,690
Now we're stuck with this.

209
00:09:07,856 --> 00:09:11,837
We've all come a long way,
but we still have a long way to go.

210
00:09:15,645 --> 00:09:19,083
None of us could have gotten to where we
are today if it wasn't for everyone here.

211
00:09:19,479 --> 00:09:23,440
But there is one man that
I would especially like to thank.

212
00:09:23,959 --> 00:09:24,805
Francis!

213
00:09:28,244 --> 00:09:28,873
<i>Francis...</i>

214
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:31,462
Your honesty has really
helped me through this.

215
00:09:32,014 --> 00:09:34,934
I went through life feeling
pretty sorry for myself.

216
00:09:35,686 --> 00:09:37,945
Thinking that I was
brutalized and abused,

217
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:40,570
but then I heard your horror stories

218
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:45,396
and I realized that my junkie
abusive mom wasn't that bad at all.

219
00:09:45,483 --> 00:09:47,164
Oh, sure, she beat me,

220
00:09:47,862 --> 00:09:49,788
she left me in that
dumpster, and all but...

221
00:09:50,967 --> 00:09:53,328
she was a saint compared to "L."

222
00:09:54,955 --> 00:09:58,603
I don't know how you survived it,
man, but I thank God you did.

223
00:10:01,811 --> 00:10:02,602
"L"?!

224
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:05,401
Hal, can you believe this?

225
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,786
They are so open here.

226
00:10:10,104 --> 00:10:11,375
It's just so raw!

227
00:10:11,382 --> 00:10:12,353
It's beautiful.

228
00:10:14,439 --> 00:10:15,308
Let's be fair.

229
00:10:16,515 --> 00:10:18,290
We all have an "L" in our lives.

230
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,270
My "L" was the Vietnam War.

231
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:26,984
Thankfully, though, I don't have to
visit my "L" on Christmas and holidays.

232
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:32,649
I can leave my "L" buried deep in
the darkest recesses of my mind.

233
00:10:34,444 --> 00:10:35,963
And I thank God for that.

234
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,534
Stay strong, Francis.

235
00:10:44,533 --> 00:10:47,896
And now, let's hear from
the man of the hour.

236
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:50,174
Our very own Francis.

237
00:10:56,102 --> 00:10:56,971
Thanks, George.

238
00:10:58,405 --> 00:10:59,037
Thank you all.

239
00:11:00,775 --> 00:11:02,832
A lot of horrible things
have been said tonight,

240
00:11:03,218 --> 00:11:04,710
and I appreciate your honesty,

241
00:11:05,845 --> 00:11:07,505
but that's in the past.

242
00:11:08,531 --> 00:11:11,071
We need to clean the slate
and start over, and to do that,

243
00:11:11,072 --> 00:11:13,138
we need to make amends to
the people we have wronged.

244
00:11:14,624 --> 00:11:16,778
To my beautiful wife, Piama...

245
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,848
for all the terrible things
I put you through...

246
00:11:21,057 --> 00:11:21,918
I'm sorry.

247
00:11:23,657 --> 00:11:26,519
And to my brothers,
who aren't here right now...

248
00:11:27,548 --> 00:11:30,637
for all the times I couldn't be
there for you 'cause I was in my own...

249
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:32,407
messed-up place...

250
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:34,202
I'm sorry.

251
00:11:35,594 --> 00:11:36,493
<i>To my father...</i>

252
00:11:38,674 --> 00:11:40,093
I put you through so much,

253
00:11:40,816 --> 00:11:42,347
yet you were always there for me.

254
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,409
I'm sorry.

255
00:11:48,442 --> 00:11:50,795
And to my mother, L...

256
00:11:54,215 --> 00:11:55,203
I forgive you.

257
00:11:59,206 --> 00:12:00,807
You forgive me?!

258
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:13,170
Okay, it's a bit extreme, but
Dewey has left us no choice.

259
00:12:13,502 --> 00:12:16,205
Since he's withstood our
most horrible tortures,

260
00:12:16,584 --> 00:12:19,755
Reese and I have to do something
that goes against everything
we believe in this house.

261
00:12:21,055 --> 00:12:22,453
How thin do you want the ham?

262
00:12:23,012 --> 00:12:24,262
Same as the last sandwich.

263
00:12:26,718 --> 00:12:27,663
How's the milkshake?

264
00:12:28,608 --> 00:12:29,794
Mm, quite nice.

265
00:12:29,939 --> 00:12:31,993
You'll notice there's no
snot, spit or pee in there.

266
00:12:32,688 --> 00:12:33,818
I thought it tasted different.

267
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,848
And the massage is amazing.

268
00:12:36,144 --> 00:12:39,167
You got tension out of my shoulder I didn't
even know was there till it was gone.

269
00:12:39,687 --> 00:12:40,350
I feel eight!

270
00:12:41,042 --> 00:12:42,185
Can we get you anything else?

271
00:12:42,903 --> 00:12:44,507
Well, there is one thing...

272
00:12:45,486 --> 00:12:45,881
Nah.

273
00:12:46,239 --> 00:12:47,793
No, what is it?

274
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:49,684
It's a little childish.

275
00:12:49,699 --> 00:12:51,938
Nonsense, Dewey.
Come on, this is your day.

276
00:12:53,381 --> 00:12:56,035
I would really love a piggy-back
ride around the neighborhood.

277
00:12:56,144 --> 00:12:57,035
I'll get my shoes.

278
00:12:57,412 --> 00:12:59,013
Guys, this is fantastic.

279
00:13:00,067 --> 00:13:01,881
I really think we've healed
a lot of wounds today.

280
00:13:03,842 --> 00:13:05,772
Really? That's great, Dewey.

281
00:13:06,981 --> 00:13:09,202
You know, I was thinking, you're full...

282
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,471
you're relaxed, you're
watching your favorite TV show...

283
00:13:12,361 --> 00:13:14,967
Do you think we could
have that, uh, car key now?

284
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:16,204
You know something?

285
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:17,656
You guys have earned it.

286
00:13:18,048 --> 00:13:18,737
You really have.

287
00:13:20,686 --> 00:13:21,896
And I wish I could give it to you.

288
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:24,588
-What do you mean?
-You guys threw me a curve ball.

289
00:13:24,978 --> 00:13:26,578
I had no idea it was
going to go this way.

290
00:13:26,902 --> 00:13:27,487
Bravo.

291
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:29,737
But I swallowed it.

292
00:13:30,085 --> 00:13:30,499
What?

293
00:13:30,797 --> 00:13:33,534
I know. It was foolish
and spiteful, but...

294
00:13:34,057 --> 00:13:35,694
this was before we reconnected.

295
00:13:37,482 --> 00:13:38,855
Hey, is there any more
of this shake left?

296
00:13:40,828 --> 00:13:41,898
Unbelievable!

297
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:46,621
You invite me up here for a celebration,
and instead, you blindside me?!

298
00:13:47,075 --> 00:13:49,316
You told complete
strangers that I'm a monster!

299
00:13:49,368 --> 00:13:50,760
Mom, I acknowledge your anger.

300
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:52,765
Well, get ready to
acknowledge a lot more!

301
00:13:52,927 --> 00:13:54,315
Oh, you "forgive me," Francis?

302
00:13:54,403 --> 00:13:56,628
Do you forgive me for
27 hours of labor?!

303
00:13:56,676 --> 00:14:00,204
For staying up all night with you when you
were sick with 105-degree temperature?!

304
00:14:00,454 --> 00:14:03,798
For the thousands of hours I spent
trying to get you to do your homework?!

305
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:05,422
Yes, Mom, I forgive you.

306
00:14:06,025 --> 00:14:09,189
So it's all my fault that your life is
messed up and you're an alcoholic?!

307
00:14:09,373 --> 00:14:11,490
I'm the source of everything
wrong with your life?!

308
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:14,706
Mom, I'd love to get into this,
but we don't talk about these
things outside the meeting.

309
00:14:14,712 --> 00:14:16,029
Well, get your coat. We're going back.

310
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:18,842
Uh, Lois, let's not ruin
Francis' special day.

311
00:14:18,844 --> 00:14:20,867
Why not? Apparently,
I've ruined everything else!

312
00:14:20,946 --> 00:14:22,558
What's past is past.

313
00:14:23,012 --> 00:14:25,302
"What's past is past"?!

314
00:14:26,161 --> 00:14:28,418
So you think this is all my fault, too?!

315
00:14:29,085 --> 00:14:30,800
Can we discuss this in the other room?

316
00:14:30,835 --> 00:14:33,259
There is no other room!

317
00:14:39,876 --> 00:14:42,452
Just admit it, guys: You've been beat.

318
00:14:42,623 --> 00:14:43,421
Are you kidding?

319
00:14:43,691 --> 00:14:46,091
Now that we know where the
key is, it's only a matter of time.

320
00:14:47,558 --> 00:14:49,198
Here's Grandma's special cereal.

321
00:14:50,373 --> 00:14:53,130
That stuff is so powerful,
she had to eat it in the bathroom.

322
00:14:53,409 --> 00:14:55,604
The recoil is going to put you
through the ceiling, little man.

323
00:14:56,821 --> 00:14:59,479
I don't know why we're going
through all this trouble. I had
a much faster way to do this.

324
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:00,965
We're not cutting him open, Reese.

325
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,203
This will still work out.

326
00:15:02,298 --> 00:15:04,046
We just have to adjust
the destruction list.

327
00:15:04,466 --> 00:15:05,256
The way I look at it,

328
00:15:05,626 --> 00:15:07,422
we have to skip paint
ballooning the Tai-chi group,

329
00:15:07,821 --> 00:15:09,950
the charity 10K won't get
its phony route markers,

330
00:15:10,241 --> 00:15:13,641
and I'm afraid planting the porn
magazines in the feminist bookstore
will have to wait till another time.

331
00:15:13,736 --> 00:15:15,303
It's like you're killing my children!

332
00:15:21,983 --> 00:15:23,585
-Wait. Wait...
-Shut up, Dewey!

333
00:15:23,591 --> 00:15:25,159
That's not the end
I want to be hearing from!

334
00:15:29,813 --> 00:15:31,477
You're taking his side in this?!

335
00:15:31,499 --> 00:15:33,645
I'm not taking anyone's side.

336
00:15:33,648 --> 00:15:35,244
There are no sides!

337
00:15:35,493 --> 00:15:37,747
I'm just saying look at
it from Francis' side.

338
00:15:37,749 --> 00:15:39,440
He crucified me in that meeting!

339
00:15:39,441 --> 00:15:42,651
You're right to feel attacked by these
people, but this is about Francis.

340
00:15:42,773 --> 00:15:44,652
He's building a new life.

341
00:15:44,901 --> 00:15:46,507
We've got to go easy on him.

342
00:15:46,544 --> 00:15:48,351
He's only been sober for one year.

343
00:15:48,622 --> 00:15:51,312
He's a one-year-old.
You're fighting with an infant!

344
00:15:51,319 --> 00:15:56,156
That infant dragged my name through the
mud and now wants us to give him $20,000!

345
00:15:56,217 --> 00:15:58,794
This is an investment in
a business for our son.

346
00:15:58,802 --> 00:16:01,605
What?! He's quit drinking, and
now magically, he knows how
to run a business?!

347
00:16:01,608 --> 00:16:04,470
See? You are still stuck
in this stupid death struggle,

348
00:16:04,552 --> 00:16:06,697
that you have had with
him since he was born!

349
00:16:06,946 --> 00:16:10,124
Francis has changed, and
you have got to face that fact!

350
00:16:10,131 --> 00:16:11,838
No! Francis has not changed!

351
00:16:12,032 --> 00:16:14,729
He has just changed his
tricks to get what he wants.

352
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:17,149
This whole day has been about
getting us to sign that loan!

353
00:16:17,152 --> 00:16:17,900
There you go again!

354
00:16:18,145 --> 00:16:20,427
I know for a fact this
is not about the loan!

355
00:16:20,433 --> 00:16:23,373
-How? How do you know that?
-Because I've already signed it, okay?!

356
00:16:23,952 --> 00:16:25,464
So can we just move on?!

357
00:16:25,971 --> 00:16:27,086
What?!

358
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,281
-Nothing yet.
-I wish there was something I could do.

359
00:16:52,889 --> 00:16:55,196
-I feel so helpless.
-Just think good thoughts.

360
00:16:59,492 --> 00:17:01,477
<i>Reese, quick, the colander!</i>

361
00:17:18,252 --> 00:17:19,240
Where do we start?

362
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:21,074
I guess you just...

363
00:17:22,235 --> 00:17:22,972
go for it.

364
00:17:26,483 --> 00:17:27,006
Dewey!

365
00:17:27,793 --> 00:17:29,559
-He had the key all along!
-No!

366
00:17:29,772 --> 00:17:30,436
That little...

367
00:17:31,973 --> 00:17:32,785
What are you doing?

368
00:17:32,988 --> 00:17:34,183
There could be a spare.

369
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:39,024
I cannot believe you went
behind my back on this!

370
00:17:39,131 --> 00:17:41,590
If you think you're going to get away
with this, you are sadly mistaken!

371
00:17:41,593 --> 00:17:43,449
$20,000, Francis?!

372
00:17:43,468 --> 00:17:44,432
How in the world would you...

373
00:17:45,765 --> 00:17:47,093
-What's this?
-The loan.

374
00:17:48,002 --> 00:17:49,298
If you're not on board,
we won't do it.

375
00:17:50,992 --> 00:17:51,416
What?

376
00:17:51,751 --> 00:17:54,095
I don't want you and Dad
fighting because of us.

377
00:17:54,168 --> 00:17:55,932
This is not how we wanted
to start our business.

378
00:17:56,689 --> 00:17:58,559
Piama and I will just get
the money from someone else.

379
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,180
But I was...

380
00:18:01,403 --> 00:18:02,723
-Really?
-Absolutely.

381
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,302
Come on. Let's go get something to eat.

382
00:18:04,743 --> 00:18:07,168
Oh, that new Thai place just
opened up around the corner.

383
00:18:07,239 --> 00:18:08,097
Sounds good to me.

384
00:18:08,259 --> 00:18:09,752
Dad, you better get your
jacket. It might get cold.

385
00:18:10,107 --> 00:18:10,625
Okay.

386
00:18:10,632 --> 00:18:11,231
Francis?

387
00:18:12,528 --> 00:18:12,973
Yeah, Mom?

388
00:18:13,241 --> 00:18:15,157
Are you sure you
don't want the money?

389
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:17,181
Mom, I don't want anything
you don't want to give.

390
00:18:22,899 --> 00:18:24,256
-Mom...
-I want you to have the loan.

391
00:18:25,709 --> 00:18:26,509
I was wrong.

392
00:18:27,443 --> 00:18:28,332
You've changed.

393
00:18:29,336 --> 00:18:30,245
Are you serious?

394
00:18:30,872 --> 00:18:32,599
-Really, you don't have to do this.
-Oh, I know.

395
00:18:33,573 --> 00:18:34,719
That's why I want you to have it.

396
00:18:35,486 --> 00:18:38,623
So that you and Piama can start
your business with our blessing.

397
00:18:43,128 --> 00:18:45,438
Wow, Mom, this is huge!

398
00:18:45,565 --> 00:18:48,618
-Well, it is a lot of money.
-Not the loan...you.

399
00:18:48,736 --> 00:18:50,971
-What?
-You actually admitted you were wrong.

400
00:18:51,377 --> 00:18:52,559
That's the first step.

401
00:18:52,622 --> 00:18:53,780
Are you ready to take the next one?

402
00:18:53,885 --> 00:18:55,312
What are you talking about? What step?

403
00:18:55,605 --> 00:18:58,113
The first step to admitting
you're an alcoholic.

404
00:18:59,699 --> 00:19:01,181
I'm not an alcoholic.

405
00:19:02,589 --> 00:19:04,036
Okay, you're not ready.

406
00:19:04,472 --> 00:19:06,596
This is my fault. They
tell us not to do this. It...

407
00:19:07,058 --> 00:19:09,027
has to come from you.
Is everybody ready to go?

408
00:19:09,092 --> 00:19:10,484
Francis, I don't drink.

409
00:19:10,826 --> 00:19:12,975
I mean, maybe I have a glass
of champagne on my birthday...

410
00:19:13,212 --> 00:19:15,530
-Every birthday?
-What does that have to do with anything?

411
00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:18,459
-I think we should get going...
-Come on, Mom, you have the classic signs.

412
00:19:18,467 --> 00:19:21,333
Irrational behavior, not able
to control your emotions.

413
00:19:21,335 --> 00:19:22,685
Everybody else is the problem.

414
00:19:22,714 --> 00:19:24,134
Francis, I do not drink.

415
00:19:24,323 --> 00:19:25,682
I am not an alcoholic.

416
00:19:25,758 --> 00:19:28,039
Mom, you don't have to
drink to be an alcoholic.

417
00:19:28,128 --> 00:19:29,006
Yeah, you do!

418
00:19:29,565 --> 00:19:30,977
Alcoholism.

419
00:19:31,289 --> 00:19:32,242
It's in the name.

420
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:33,530
I think your mother's right on this.

421
00:19:33,649 --> 00:19:35,006
No, she's not.

422
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,062
I barely drank, and I'm an alcoholic.

423
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:39,079
It's true; I've only
seen him tipsy once.

424
00:19:39,227 --> 00:19:41,541
He gets sick. I can't even
give him cough syrup.

425
00:19:41,977 --> 00:19:45,583
How the hell can you call yourself
an alcoholic if you don't even drink?!

426
00:19:45,646 --> 00:19:47,552
What do you mean?!
My life was a wreck!

427
00:19:47,823 --> 00:19:49,466
I had no future, no hope.

428
00:19:49,644 --> 00:19:52,155
-I had all the signs.
-Except for the alcohol part.

429
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:53,718
Why do you keep harping on that?!

430
00:19:54,172 --> 00:19:55,300
Why do you have to do that?!

431
00:19:55,396 --> 00:19:56,675
You never let me have anything!

432
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:58,698
You wouldn't let me have that
bike or those throwing stars!

433
00:19:58,702 --> 00:20:00,415
Now you won't let me have alcoholism...

434
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:02,471
the one thing I'm doing right in my life!

435
00:20:02,561 --> 00:20:03,264
Unbelievable.

436
00:20:03,645 --> 00:20:05,779
If it's not me, it's alcohol, right?

437
00:20:06,234 --> 00:20:07,858
The problem's always somewhere else.

438
00:20:08,381 --> 00:20:10,181
Francis, you need to
take a look in the mirror.

439
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:12,568
Come on, Hal, let's go home.

440
00:20:13,924 --> 00:20:14,580
Wait a minute.

441
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:16,630
You can't walk out on me!

442
00:20:17,172 --> 00:20:18,642
This is your problem, too!

443
00:20:20,744 --> 00:20:22,376
At least you support me, right, Dad?

444
00:20:22,573 --> 00:20:27,104
You know, I thought I did, son,
but then I realized I was just
doing it for all the wrong reasons.

445
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:29,416
I was just trying to buy your love.

446
00:20:33,753 --> 00:20:35,326
See you on your real birthday, son.

447
00:20:49,351 --> 00:20:50,899
You know, maybe Mom was right.

448
00:20:51,904 --> 00:20:54,524
I was blaming her and the
alcohol for my problems...

449
00:20:55,517 --> 00:20:57,759
when the real problem was
always right in front of me...

450
00:20:59,125 --> 00:20:59,865
Me?!

451
00:21:00,086 --> 00:21:00,912
Yes, you.

452
00:21:01,349 --> 00:21:02,207
Who else could it be?

453
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:04,128
Why didn't you tell me
I wasn't an alcoholic?!

454
00:21:04,168 --> 00:21:06,826
How am I supposed to know?!
You seemed messed up to me.

455
00:21:06,903 --> 00:21:08,075
<i>You made me look like an idiot!</i>

456
00:21:08,076 --> 00:21:10,175
<i>-That wasn't hard to do.
-Was that an insult?!</i>

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
