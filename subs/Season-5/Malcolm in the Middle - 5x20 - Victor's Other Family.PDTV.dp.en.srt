I'm sorry that the will of the

No, Reese.
I have in mind strangers.

66
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:39,900
These people have the same DNA,
as we are, it's a little scary.

67
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,100
There is nothing to be afraid, Mom.
There's nothing terrible.

68

You must be Lois. And for the deposit appears that

Yes cohesive as Logicism.

00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,900
And it's funny.

82
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,500
Hey, Malcolm. I'm taking your
brother to hunt geese.

83

If we are so similar genetically,
why it is more szczêœliwy?

100
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:45,100
You're talking to your ¹ s ³ ever since the girls are?

101
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,100
You know what?
It's none of my business.

102
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,400
Sylvia, Robert,

Look at our cottage on the lake.

107
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,900
I think that this year,
when opiekowaliœmy up Heron.

He used zagnieŸdzi were in her hair.

110
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:21,500
Look at this.
We are dressed like homeless people.

111
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,600
That was the adoption of the costume?

112
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:27,800
Yeah. Very funny.
And long-long.

113
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:34,900
Here's more from the head tat the CYM

117
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:52,100
Yeah, but Victor was not the ideal.
Sometimes it was to a little grumpy.

118
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,600
But siadaliœmy together and we talked.

You are still thinking why
Everything is so in the deposit of about s

Okay, that's the only Szyda box.

149
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:03,400
Listen to me, twardzielko.
I know about the other retired Victor!

150
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,300
Victor worked for Paragon
Brush from 1960 to 1964.

151
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:15,000
Manitoba Family Law says
¿It ¿s as I am entitled to this pension!

152
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,400
I do not know what you mean.

153
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:23,500
Is not it going to explode out of the grave and strangle you.
And the whole a family of yours!

154
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,500
Mom, I'll talk about it later!

155
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,500
If you do not leave,
zawacham not to

156
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:31,200
Pulling off æ tugging the wig you
and everyone can see your scars are!

157
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,200
It's not over yet!

158
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:44,000
Canada is the best country in the world!

159
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,200
Part, Grandma.

160
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,800
I do not believe that the earlier half of em do not.

161
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:51,500
Nature is that of the deposit, it
and beautiful. And poorly was hiding.

162
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,200
Never ... Details.

163
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:57,900
He ... This ... frightening months œmiech!

164
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,000
Thanks, the ope ch.
Already it I will not be the Potrzebowo.

165
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,000
Next time,
I'll be d strives for the eye contact.

166
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:08,300
Wyœcig is for two days.
WyjdŸmy outside a little poæwiczyæ!

167
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,900
Where to hold water bottles?

168
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,200
T need props to the charade?

169
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,400
Hey, my mom bought the a fire extinguisher?

170
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,500
- Dad, you should not ...
- Why did it before me, the hide of a?

171
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:34,000
Yes, Mom.
He found the j ¹.

172
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,500
The doctor said,
Also two weeks. Part of.

173
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,700
I have to przyznaæ,
And they took me almost the EOE.

174
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,900
I was really thinking of,
Also this time would come.

175
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,100
Dewey, that would be the case!

176
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:50,400
If I wanted to up oœlepiæ,
This is one of atwiejszych ways!

177
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,100
That also I hate to disappoint the pain
more than burnt cornea.

178
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,100
And the pain as hell!

179
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,300
Not Suffering dotrzymywaæ
promises, Dewey. Really.

180
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,300
This is the truth.

181
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:07,100
I remember once my dad promised,
Also we take me to air shows ...

182
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,300
Jerome is amazing. He was born
up with the same brain, like me,

183
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:16,100
but u ¿uses it to zaprzyjaŸniania up
with popular ludŸmi who hate me are.

184
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,800
You're right, no one
d celebrates local government school.

185
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:22,300
But what happens to the ego,
to be gathered, zasadzimy some trees,

186
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,100
and will make that the schools and will be a little
more enjoyable for everyone?

187
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:29,800
Wow. Jerome says something of serious
and there is wyœmiany.

188
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,400
This is one in a million chance
in the school the society.

189
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,100
I am glad also that he, not me.

190
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,100
Why did not I was to me!

191
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,600
Do not forget about tomorrow
evening, will be karaoke.

192
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,000
- Office of the Karaoke You Save?
- Yes, you should wpaœæ.

193
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:55,200
Karaoke is not my horse.
You probably sing well.

194
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:58,700
- Oh, no. I'm terrible.
- So why are you doing this?

195
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Are not you afraid that the leave
the finite idiot?

196
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,800
If you are afraid to exit the idiot,
it's never a good tarry not.

197
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,400
Forget about having fun czyimœ cost.

198
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,400
God, it is much better than me.

199
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,000
Zamroziliœmy retire Victor
because of a dispute with another family ¹ ¹.

200
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,600
But you have the absolute right.

201
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:22,100
The law states that Manitoba is that the ¿it
is entitled to a pension a husband ¿

202
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,000
Even if the second family
podpisaæ not want to move,

203
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,200
This probably win the day are.

204
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,000
Of course you dowieŸæ,
You're a legitimate on the ¿¹.

205
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,500
You have a DNA test zrobiæ children
jakieœ documents for both parties,

206
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,500
telephone bills, this
type of thing. But powinnaœ wygraæ.

207
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:39,700
Finally, Canadian
that is not the idiot.

208
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,500
The problem is that the pension
is $ 43.50 per month, Canadian.

209
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:51,100
Hiring a lawyer costs
s-governmental, other expenses

210
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:56,900
kosztowaæ the bed so that the leave
at its after 20 or 30 years.

211
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:04,400
- Do you think that the more behind the ¿'re alive?
- God, no! That is, ... No.

212
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,000
I'm sorry.

213
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,500
But today's visit
This is not a complete failure of the.

214
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:15,200
I'll give you a coupon for 10% discount ¿ki
when buying a toothbrush.

215
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,600
The same, which I use it in ¿.

216
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:26,600
- Okay, Mom. Did you come to attempt. Let's go.
- No, we'll do it.

217
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,100
What?
There listens Did you come?

218
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,400
He said,
Also lose on the the money.

219
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,500
It's not important.
We'll hire a lawyer.

220
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:39,400
So much hate these people,
Also ruin sure that the Eby be with them even?

221
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,600
This g of silly!

222
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,700
He was my husband ¿³ em.

223
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,000
Ok, I'll get the coupon em.

224
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,600
If you will be even czegoœ
potrzebowaæ, then call us.

225
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,700
Consider us
the second a family of Victor.

226
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,600
Or rather the third.

227
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,000
Hello, dear Lois.

228
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:08,800
Do not have with me my mom.

229
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:13,700
Listen to Sylvia. It turned out,
Also a pension, but tiny.

230
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,100
- $ 40 per month.
- That's it?

231
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,900
Yes, my mom
the awful fiercely and

232
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,700
and is ready straciæ all
the money, ¿Eby are wygraæ in court.

233
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:21,900
Oh, boy.

234
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:26,400
Wondered am you whether you was to want you
so me and the and signed the transfer.

235
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,100
It will never happen.
Goodbye, dear.

236
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:34,500
But you have everything.
And my mom might happen just that.

237
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,700
I just want some way to
be related are bound with her husband ¿em.

238
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,100
You mean my husband ¿a

239
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,700
This conversation is over!

240
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:03,300
Canceling a check for Victor
his sister, with your signature!

241
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:07,200
BEAUTIFUL! Let them try the tell,
Also there is no ³ ¿eñstwo.

242
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:12,000
Take a look! Pigs, which are
Victor painted of me.

243
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:16,300
This can potrwaæ year or two,
but lengthens ubiemy them the $ 40 face!

244
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,400
You know what, Mom,
When we are in a day

245
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,700
it will be better,
when we work on are your attitudes are.

246
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:28,600
When mixed with other ludŸmi,
³ may want you to be more friendly,

247
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,500
says the c: "How are you".

248
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:33,300
Then the people Think,
Also depends on you for their feelings

249
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,700
and perhaps the start to the
EAE depends on yours.

250
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:39,100
- What the hell are you talking about?!
- I'm trying to help you.

251
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:44,700
I also so Vuschka.
I'm sorry, I have so much to remember.

252
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,100
You can show this to me
more tricks tomorrow.

253
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,300
It's funny, is not it, Mom?

254
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:52,500
After so many years,
we help each other.

255
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,700
If you were of a ¿s much as I do,
it would not surprise you that the Father

256
00:15:59,100 --> 00:15:59,700
What's this?

257
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,500
Results of blood tests
Perform the sermons that lawyer.

258
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,200
It says that the paternity
is genetically impossible.

259
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:11,400
It is written,
Also my dad is not my father!

260
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:18,500
- Mia ³ am 80% certainty that, yes.
- What?

261
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:22,900
As soon as Victor comes to the
home, the terminal branches of the am it to the bedroom.

262
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,400
Had to be about something not so
¿with its flanges (pleminkami).

263
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
What! Mom, how can I Did you come
something like this do?!

264
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,400
He was am lonely!

265
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,700
Your father had the
a lot of traveling ¿s business.

266
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,400
Now you already know
I had the interest in them.

267
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:41,100
- Who is my father?!
- Why do you need to Know-?

268
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,000
Rodo Goboski.

269
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:51,700
Its the only advantage of the was to a umiejêtnoœæ
walking in the hands of the stairs.

270
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,700
And what about Susan?
Is she the daughter the father?

271
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:59,400
- Everything is possible.
- How can such k Did you come to the hack!

272
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,600
Honey, do not smuæ up.
We can change the "A" to "B".

273
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,700
The judge will buy it for sure.

274
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:09,600
Mother!
I take Jamie and let's get out the d

275
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,400
Dad, I do not want this,
This hose extensions below box.

276
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,000
What in the following hose extensions lying?

277
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,900
- You solve the zanego right shoe.
- You see, Dewey? Co-operation!

278
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,500
/ Players, Set ... ready ...

279
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:56,100
She's a brick ... house.

280
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,100
Now you.

281
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:02,500
Jerome, thank you. I was thinking of that the I
genetically doomed to nieszczêœcie.

282
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,500
But we are related
and you're szczêœliwy.

283
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,200
So, it is ¿I can!

284
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,800
- Part.
- Part, Lois.

285
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,600
Can I go ponosiæ?

286
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:18,200
Talked I am of the, is
stubborn and completely nierozs the bottom.

287
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:21,900
But with you, your honey.
Really.

288
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:26,500
- Do not want to again k the OCIA, Lois.
- Do not have to. I wieœci.

289
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,900
Zrobiliœmy blood tests
and I am the daughter of Victor.

290
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,800
It turned out that the'm not
relative with you, completely of them.

291
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,300
But we are so similar.

292
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:39,700
It's amazing, is not it?
You know what's more amazing?

293
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,700
It does not change anything.

294
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:46,300
Because despite the fact
