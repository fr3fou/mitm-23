Kitty is not a journey ¿s ³ u ¿s business trip ...

105

The entire email is the ¿eñstwo was to build
the same care of him.

He had no notion of am.

Two months ago and will announce the,

Listen to Abe, I'm sorry,

127
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,500
Abe, you tell him.

None of your business.

What's going on?

134
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,600
Kitty and Abe divorced.

135
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,200
Now leave us alone.

136
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:27,900
What?

137
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,900
Abe, you have to post the The five and must be
and póœæ to him now.

138
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:31,900
What about Malcolm?

139
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,100
Why he can not tell him?

140
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,500
Is there was to be better
if he heard the us of a best friend?

141
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,300
He said I, I I can also of doing this.

142
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,700
Reese, Exit immediately!

143
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:40,900
Why I had of him to tell me?

144
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,500
Well, there's some of your guilt.

145
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:44,100
What?

146
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,700
That you always encourages the EOE him to try the new things -

147
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,000
- Dances, mountain expeditions, basketball.

148
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,700
Before you know of,
barely doing the deal with yo-yo.

149
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:55,500
For what it is supposed to contain because
All components of the & Beverages?

150
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,000
Not now, Dewey.

151
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,100
End of discussion, Abe.
Now Ides!

152
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,300
All right, he said I to him.

153
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,400
What?

154
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,400
You ¿ko bears it.

155
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:07,800
Someone should be there pójœæ
and with it porozmawiaæ.

156
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,300
It's really weird.

157
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,100
Mine were just three days
ever since the d Stevie found out about the mother,

158
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:24,600
but it looks as if the SIE to undo the
in the development of 10 years.

159
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:31,500
So, as you can handle them?

160
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:36,200
Than we can simply
be afraid of their physical advantage

161
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,400
Come on, Stevie.

162
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:48,200
I know that you ¿ko you now,
but we play in the tournament.

163
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:51,600
This should help you
tn deny the thoughts æ ¹ something else.

164
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,300
Just talk to me, Stevie.

165
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:57,300
I know it is not with you
until that bad.

166
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:02,600
You have no idea
Going by what and how you feel.

167
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:08,300
Now, if you let the
I wanted to retain the remnants of the breathing.

168
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,900
I discontinue this to use.

169
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,000
You can not speak of soup ...

170
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,900
You do not need it.

171
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,500
As you wish.

172
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:23,200
If you do not want
with me to chat I'll go.

173
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,000
This whole thing with a roœniêciem
it is not all right.

174
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:33,300
When you are born, everything is perfect,
but before you know it all starts with psuæ.

175
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,700
With each time dedicating the day you
less attention,

176

So you need to robiæ,
and I love you a little less the.

177
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,700
No. So it is only in this family.

183

184
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,100
Sorry.

185
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,500
Do not pick it up?

186
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,200
What for?

187
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,800
Because it œmieæ.

188

Or are you one of those charming people are smokers,
Suggest who are, also is obliged to others?

189
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,100

For the rest of life

and equipment are ba taæ the mess
How are leaving behind?

191
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,200
Let me also ask you about something.

192
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,900
He was born AOE circle something about 45th?

193
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,700
People like you are the reason
amounts to a pair of hose

194
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:31,100
as soon as I finish college!

195
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,100
Oh, my God also?

196
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,700
This girl government today.

197
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:44,000
When each also something you lift up,
you have of doing this!

198
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:47,700
I do not know what to do.

199
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,700
Stevie is devastated.

200
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,200
I'm trying to him to chat
but only calms me.

201
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,200
'll Be all right.
You see, Abe.

202
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,200
Everything will return to normal. Come on.

203
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,700
You do not want spóŸniæ an appointment.

204
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,100
I do not know what's going on with the Yamim.

205
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,900
Already passed out of the food with the word of oiczków,
but are still being wants to be breast-fed.

206
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:04,600
Not now, honey.

207
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,400
I'm here to do
family matters.

208
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,900
If you do be slightly semi-aczliwy
during the meeting, do as I do -

209
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,400
- Spill coffee on yourself and Exit the room.

210
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,900
You're too good to me.

211
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,500
Hal, what exactly do you do with Abe'm?

212
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:22,500
I've seen the am as it EoE makes the sweater knit,
and yesterday the lying massage his feet.

213
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:25,900
I know that you like him very much,
but do not write him replace the Kitty.

214
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,200
This is ridiculous, Lois.

215
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,900
Just behave like a friend.

216
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,600
So, with the otko.

217
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,200
Francis?

218
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:42,600
Yes?

219
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,600
Do not take care of the EOE even a can of the paint, right?

220
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,900
What's the question?

221
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,700
If it was to,
or hides the'd be in front of you are?

222
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,100
Already well, Francis.

223
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,800
It's not all right for me to
the Weight AAE you with this burden.

224
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:55,000
We'll do it together.

225
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,000
Think only.

226
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,500
Sends the it to the better place

227
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,700
the vast field of small
and cold mountain streams

228
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:06,400
where will can flow biegaæ whole day,
and the horses are ridden people.

229
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,300
I think that the by the and of the white horse.

230
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,000
Then spend the whole wiecznoœæ in the lake of fire,

231
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:14,000
with delicious bales of hay,
were in immediately outside the service area.

232
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,300
Otto, do not kill the've never
anything bigger than a poodle.

233
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,700
And this was to clean the case.

234
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:22,100
Francis, however difficult that it was to no,
I know that the ladies do the trick.

235
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:25,600
Nobody he said,
Also force the cowboy is simple.

236
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:29,300
They met for the fifth, and yoga.

237
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,800
What are you doing, Steve?

238
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,400
I saw the jeŸdzi as the EOE
upwards and downwards on the ramp.

239
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,100
/ You can also look for the other project?

240

Well, not my mom.

But the thing is, you have also
any right of oœciæ squint up.

248
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:01,300
/ You're right.

"Mom and I left a

255
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:18,600
Do not let those guys just
siedzieæ and use the Alaa over the Sat.

256
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,700
Orient themselves.

257
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:23,500
Come on, you're not

00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,200
The child in a wheelchair.

00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,000
Have you selected the I with the s way

266

00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,400
Do not help anyone.

274
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:06,700
Never to the EOE love, right?

275
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,300
The twelfth of October.

276

During lunch,
JJ and predicts the future of me.

277
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,600
Again, "girl".

278
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,400
I'm telling you, I'd had of the same girl.

279
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,900
While I'll be laughing at all of the children

280
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:22,300
This whole e mothering
seems to be a nightmare.

281
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,700
Who's that?

282
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,900
I do not know.

283
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:30,900
But it comes to second base (the catching for boob)
if I've got something to say.

284
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,000
I just have to znaleŸæ way
that I noticed that the.

I do not think byœ and had to martwiæ about it.

286
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,200
What do you mean?

287
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:40,300
You know, when he does something,
what you do not like it and ..

288
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,800
is charging you for it.

289
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,900
What!

290
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,900
Do not switch the transport and cargo handling on people.

291
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,400
Honey, I'm sorry,
I'm also telling you this, but ...

292
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:52,000
the truth is,
Also you all call the "Geba."

293
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,300
Geba?

294
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,200
Yes, but this band
immature small half-grams of pencils.

295
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:59,500
A director just
I'm trying to fit within.

296
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,100
Abe, not the apiesz flu.

297
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,000
It's just your allergy.

298
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,700
For the EOE ¿s medicine?

299
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:16,600
Check your jacket pocket.

300
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,200
What I will I do with you?

301
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,200
You can poklepaæ me in the back?

Thanks.

303

Please, canned paint.

304
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,500
I will give you the greatest of the,
most of the nicer carrots, as the ³ I have found.

305
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:31,800
Please, Francis, do not overload the gajmy
This d for much longer, than is necessary.

306
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,500
All right, let's do just that.

307
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,800
Do not worry, canned paint.

308
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,200
Coming soon will be over.

309
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:47,300
As a sign of the cut range for the trigger
and once to the end of her suffering, we aim.

310
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,600
Ready ..

pal!

313
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:56,600
Why not shoot the EOE?

314
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:57,700
Well, you are not to score ³ ¿EOE.

315
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,200
I was not the ready.

316
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,100
Now already am.
