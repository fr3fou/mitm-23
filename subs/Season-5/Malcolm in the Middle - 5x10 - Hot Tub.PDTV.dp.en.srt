34
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,200
The EOE lost their mind?
We can not afford to pozwoliæ.

35
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:04,900
So he said I was, but then the seller

You know also that such decisions
always take together.

39
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:16,100
That was a shop promotion.
Dostaliœmy tablespoon discount of 20% percent.

40
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,800
In addition, the card club baths,

And it should be especially
convince you, Lois - sealing.

œwietne things as hot tubs.

50
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:40,700
¯ s what?

51
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,000
Lois, such opportunities
Incoming not without liabilities.

52
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,300
Nothing on the do not earn.

53
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,200
And if ¹ æ take the inflation into account, it's almost as
as if it is our semi-ACILIA 2800 bucks.

54
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:54,000
$ 2,800!
I can not uwierzyæ!

55
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,800
Connect the EOE decisions behind my back,
EOE had issued the money, which had no legal EOE spend it all

56
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,100

57
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,500
Do not worry.

58
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:06,900
It has a very detailed head of the assembly instructions,
where never misplaced, because we take the Malcolm j.

59
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:09,600

60
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,900
G the pencil to the child and under direct sunlight.

61
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,700
- What are you doing, Otto?
- You know the new rules of security.

62
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:29,100
He was too much
unnecessary accidents.

63
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:33,200
There is no excuse
for being careless ¿NYM.

64
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:56,800
Francis!

65
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:00,900
Do not believe the byœ what happened the o
Almost ...

66
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,800
Otto! Oh, my God also?

67
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,800
Are you all right?

68
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,800
Manfred Schmidt.

69
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,600
And I do not speak of you?

70
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:19,500
Do not care about the whole world,
when you are in the hot tub.

71
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,400
It's like going back to the amniotic sac.

72
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,800
Jamie will be the spa
for the next hour.

73
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,600
I can of the ¿yczyæ your car,
wyskoczyæ briefly to the Lucky Aide?

74
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,600
I will lead!

75
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,600
Do not be. I can handle it.

76
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,800
- Appearance date on so relaxed, and it's just ...
- None problem.

77
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I have the keys. JedŸmy!

78
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,400
Take a break from the angle of troubles, dear.
No, thanks.

79
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,600
Since the EOE decided, that we are the family,
where Each does what he wants,

80
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,700
I decided the am,
Also I do not want be in the tub.

81
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:54,200
The fault beams are brilliant.
I do not've heard the saying of what a

82
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:57,700
And really ... if you are listening,
everything is at your own risk vibration.

83
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:58,800
Trees and grass ...

84
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:02,000
Sometimes it seems that
Also the whole world cries.

85
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:06,600
But you can dostaæ one of these machines are
to us the ear noise and podkrêciæ ...

86
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:07,400
Stop here.

87
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,400
- And what about the pharmacy?
- I have something to Buy.

88
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,500
But grazing. I can jeŸdziæ.

89
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,200
I have the opportunity Put some are better
to become familiar Polly.

90
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,300
It turns out that the twelve years
no TV

91
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:27,000
and instead of chemicals,
dry-cleaning facilities in ¿uses.

92
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,300
But it ¿¿d up and it is so cool.

93
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,500
- Gas! Gas!
- What?

94
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:33,600

Give me a minute to explained by,
Also does not do anything with the am of the former.

97
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,600
Trust me, do not threaten us
¿No danger.

98
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:47,000
So pull your foot off the gas.

99
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:55,100
Okay, what Feel invited Did you come? What is this thing?
This is mine. Belongs to me.

100

and so consists, also my mom.

101
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:03,300
- Your what?
- In the middle is my mother. Her ashes.

102
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:07,700
He wanted the am for her the prettier urns
but precisely Raise my tuition in Wicca School.

103
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,900
So they can not poprosiæ Did you come to it
of these drugs?

104
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,800
That's not the narrowest aœciwszy
method of disposal with Danny.

105
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
He's very upset.

106
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:15,300
What?

107
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,700
Please do not tell my parents.

108
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:21,200
Let it be between us, okay?

109
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:25,900
I love Jamie, he to me,
and at the break of me would not be able to go widywaæ.

110
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,200
Literally.

111
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,600
Emotions can œciskaæ
internal organs, Malcolm.

112
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:33,700
It will help me wybrn can ¹ æ this?

113
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,500
Right.

114
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:36,800
This is weird.

115
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,300
All of which are now thinking
"But it is fun to lead."

116
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,200
Francis saw the EOE Otto?

117
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,200
What happened on?

118
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,900
I do not like it, allow the eyes.
There are so prone to accidents.

119
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,600
For those over the last few days
demolition of our two cars,

120
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:55,900
falls of the stairs, and this morning
set fire to the glasses themselves in the hair.

121
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,800
Gretchen, my dear,
that can flow byœ przynieœæ tweezers?

122
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,700
It seems sure that the back of the books I
stuffed cactus.

123
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:05,900
- Otto just about getting started to Goia.
- I'm sorry.

124
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,200
I do not do this damage resulted from actions.

125
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,600
- Francis, unless the damage resulted from actions they are doing.
- What, mutilation of ourselves?

126
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:16,600
I do not think that all these
events that were accidental.

127
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:22,300
As if jakiœ Subconscious energy
and the punishment of my jakieœ unknown ...

128
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,900
Otto, what it means for you
Manfred Schmidt first name?

129
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,800
I was not thinking of it for years.

130
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,300
- I ...
- What?

131
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,400
Manfred Schmidt fiance Gretchen.

132
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,500
This means that the,
as long as he did not sneaked to steal the em.

133
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:42,900
EOE steals the Gretchen?

134
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,100
He was my best friend,
but it is ¿³ I fall in love at Gretchen.

135
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:52,000
And on the day when we had to get away,
I he said Manfred,

136
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:57,400
Gretchen also already leaving for the a and wanted to and up
with him to view the train station in Berlin.

137
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,100
Otto ...

138
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:01,400
Poor Gretchen became a
for hours in the rain, inconsolable.

139
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:06,200
Then arrives the I ME
And so all of the deposit of s o ..

140
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:12,800
And now please - 25 years of perfect continuity me ...
built on the amstwie k.

141
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,400
Otto, I'll tear internally.

142
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:19,000
Why do not you call him and apologize,
It can really hurt you?

143
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:22,100
Francis, you do not have enough guts.

144
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:27,400
Besides, now that I know,
What is behind this, can the problem goes away.

145
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,800
It tacks.

146
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,200
Dad.

147
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:38,600
Noah bawiæ we had together,
but when I went of his house, there was to it there.

148
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,100
I was waiting for the hour, but he does not show the.

149
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,100
Where fault this pessimism?

150
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:48,700
You can email him something fixed and drove on the
to the hospital, alba died and his grandmother.

151
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:54,200
And then my ... a soldier
l the lands on and kills your parachute.

152
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,000
As I'm cold!

153
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,300
See Jamie, flying airplane.
Say "aaaah ...".

154

172
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:51,800
The Lucky Aide is only 4 km in both directions,
but mysteriously counter pointed to 37 km.

Because by the EOE honest with me,
Do not dispose of the garbage.

179
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,400

Daae viewing the film with dogs.

188
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,500

189
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:09,000

Dosyæ us up to the ear of em.

305
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:35,400
It makes me sick
from the angle of your canvas with drugs,

306
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,000
drugs which do not have the
nothing in common.

307
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,800
- They do not have the?
- These are the I think that, yes.

308
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,500
The problem is your relationship are related,

309
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:47,500
that remains a problem, if not
begin with each other to chat to people.

310
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:55,400
I think the reflections of when leave Did you come
without the ¿me farewell.

311
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Sorry about that.

312
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,400
Both we knew
D also the longer it did not make it.

313

315
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,900
So if everything's taken care of,
Turn around and go home.

316
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
You're a healer of hearts, Malcolm.

317
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:25,800
Now already it's too late, but surely
the future life of this isolated ¿you rip the Latin.

318
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,800
I must tell that the've seen the
something like this just for the steam-boats.

319
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,200
I must perform some calls
in this case.

320
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:46,200
Œmia of a, say it.
I know that already you can not doczekaæ up.

321
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,300
Why do I always have to
psuæ whole the fun in that?

322
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,100
What are you talking about?

323
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:56,200
You know how it be that,
you always have to speak "no"?

324
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,700
I hate this.

325
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:01,000
Honey, we are grateful for that.

326
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,200
It's you we hold back
before killing himself.

327
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,800
Yes, but it's the only thing I can hear it

328
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,500
"Why can not we?"
and "it never let me."

329
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:13,700
Is the time though I can not be the
who comes up with the crazy idea?

330
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,800
You know what? As most.

331
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,600
Œmia the Father
What do you have in g half?

332

333
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,600
All right. It should
powstrzymaæ growth of algae.

334
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,600
Use of this gentleman lives to spaliæ
external layer of the skin,

335
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:36,400
and the medicine of the Company are gradually kill it,
what about the rest of the Lord's urethra.

336
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:41,300
That was about the abduction,
and not our fault ...

337
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,500

Oh my God,
This ZRZ the device fate.

339
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:48,600
Zapukaliœmy, and now the universe
corresponds to the "who's there?"

340
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:52,500
If you ask the to the've stayed here the whole night.

Ch of boys, the mother and the wpad

Probably too crazy.
