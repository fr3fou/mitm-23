That's the best part of my day.

13
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,300
16 minutes between horror at the school,
and horror at home.

Best months of the attack,

00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:14,600
Who am I kidding.
Probably never talks to him the EOE.

18
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:15,800
Hiya.

19

23
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:29,600
It is at the level of the hamster.

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,200
And only if we take
very g of hamster play the fool.

25
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,800
Mom says I have also other advantages.

26
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,500
Since you're a najm are smarter in school,

28
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:45,400
You do not understand.
Ira is a footballer.

29
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:49,900
This means that the when czegoœ needs
are those non-athletes, as you are giving it to him.

/ Part, honey.

34
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,900
You need to calm down.

35
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:14,100
- Jesus. Who this time?
- Do not speak until you calm down.

Honey, I want tea,

39
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:34,900
What happened with your dad?

40
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,500
Found out of what she would do the Reese.

41

What a day. Features a large lose of your ¹
the second hand machine meat.

45
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,300
I close the sanel of us for 15 minutes.

46
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,800
The whole of that afternoon south graliœmy.

47
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Sit down!

48
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,300
I want to Know-how
do the EOE something so horrible!

49
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,300
And thinking of EOE, also get away with a semi-otal!

50
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,600
You said:
break free or suffocate?

51
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,600
What are you talking about?

52
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:12,900
You know what we mean.
In some foreign Zesz week ...

53
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,000
In the developing world
these things are happening on the ound of!

54
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,400
What I have with you zrobiæ, Reese?

55
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,500
I will not say
Also it was to complete the inflection,

56
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,900
because when you say that,
to treat it as a challenge!

57
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:28,000
You know what?
I labored like the ox of 6 hours!

58
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,900
I do not like the screams to me
Upon entering the house!

59
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,900
Not complaining!

60
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:37,000
Do not complain, oœle!

61
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,100
Hal, give yourself another the minute!

62
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,900
You can store both up close the!

63
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:46,700
Oh shit. In this family so
is called "closing the door".

64
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,700
What is certain is that the Reese will not be
living here for the next six days ¿.

65
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,500
The only question is,
Who will get the ball this honor.

66
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,800
- Going out
- Come out!

67
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,600
No, if first we get to the knobs!

68
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,100
- Wynoœ hence the up!
- The elevation of the hence the!

69
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,000
I won the I!

70
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,600
/ Again dug Reese?

71
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:13,000
Yes, I've seen the with him
for two days. It's impressive the box.

72
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,100
Usually after this time eats
Karma cats Mrs. Harvey.

73
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:19,300
This is terrible! How can such a
robiæ in the asnemu child?

74
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,700
Yeah, it's very traumatic.

75
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,900
Do not worry about the the fact
How causing injury to his psyche?

76
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,900
/ Home is not czegoœ dependence niony!

77
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,000
The house should be friendly,
safe i ..

78
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,400
- Really?
- What?

79
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,400
They kicked me, and I had the 15 years.

80
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,400
/ I already I will not return to the house.
/ They can not zrobiæ this Reese'owi.

81
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,200
I must zrobiæ something.
Someone has their powstrzymaæ!

82
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,700
Only I understand it,
what they are monsters!

83
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:46,300
For the rest of the family, it is not
such a big problem as for you.

84
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,700
Can exaggerate.

85
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:54,000
I'm exaggerating? Dewey, as we will
haunted you will understand.

86
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,500
S are in life certain things,
called priorities.

87
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,100
Wyjaœniê you in a few
hours when I arrive.

88
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:02,100
Now I must zadzwoniæ
to Otta and make it easier to break.

89
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,700
Exaggerating.

90
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,600
Œwietne timing,
muffins are ready.

91
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,700
Thanks, also rang EOE.

92
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,200

93
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,500
/ Whose cottage?

94
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,600
This is mine.
Fully furnished and with the cable.

95
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,100
I he said that the 18 years I have
and they gave me two years the lease ¿awe.

96
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,000
Do you like banana, right?

97
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,000
Reese, you can not mieszkaæ in such a place!

98
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,300
In precisely that the I can.
They are special offers.

99
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:37,100
The first month of the free, then
$ 375 per month, utilities included.

100
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,800
I can zarobiæ for rent
A week, as I'll get overtime.

101
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,500
I should of doing this a half years ago.

102
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,800
Reese, come, let's go to the roof.

103
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:47,300
Students from the school were nursing
are taking a break for a smoke.

104
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,900
I can not.
My brothers are will come for breakfast.

105
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,600
Francis, this is Teddy, Lou, George.

106
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,400
Divorced, separated,
¿Asleep with her best friend.

107
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:58,600
He was a white best friend.
I'm sorry.

108
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,800
Okay, you know where we'll be.

109
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,400
- Hey, it's the wedding meal?
- Yeah.

110
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,400
You better start already chowaæ the money.

111
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,000
Part of the Young man.
This place is awesome!

112
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,900
Reese also know this seems to be great.

113
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,200
But Each objective observer,
also say it's not true.

114
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,800
This place is awesome!

115
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,700
One thing is certain, in your place
I would live here permanently the E!

116
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,600
Who wants cupcakes?

117
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:22,100
- Me!
- Me!

118
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,700
No!
¯ no cupcakes!

119
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:26,000
Reese, you can not
bawiæ in the house!

120
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:30,000
Parents have done something terrible to you,
as much as I did!

121
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,200
But you do not, you can them that popuœciæ!

122
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,400
This is not your place,
your place is in the house!

123
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:35,500
No good.

124
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,400
Replace the one thing in my life ¿, which
to be the better if I had been at home.

125
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,900
I was thinking of that the toilet seat is not
require heating the whole is a good argument.

126
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Approx. The most important is that the essay
the application looks as you would any other essay.

127
00:06:56,100 --> 00:07:01,800
You know, like homework.
In one of the lessons.

128
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,700
Next, Ira, I know also that sounds abstruse,
but the best fast start æ.

129
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:12,100
As if you had one of opisaæ
s the word, what would it was to the word?

130
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:18,500
Ira.

131
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,400
Approx.
Already we have.

132
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,800
Ira.
You see, we started.

133
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,400
- What else?
- I do not know.

134
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,900
I'm not a writer,
or reader.

135
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:36,400
I do not like of words, the stare and me
the plant of puzzlement. These are the hundreds of them.

136
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,200
Calm down.
You'll be fine. You know what?

137
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,600
Ask for something and you answer
what you fall into g halfway.

138
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,800
Najwczeœniejszym my memory is ...

139
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:49,500
Blue ... something.

140
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,700
Something blue.
Well, you can it to use.

141
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,100
How to ...

142
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:01,200
Sometimes my childhood
is vague and distant e

143
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:05,100
As something surrounded by the blue mist are.

144
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,800
- See that?
- Yeah, that's cool.

145
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,900
My greatest fear is ...

146
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,500
The spider book.
No, waffles.

147
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:21,900
I let my fears obmyæ me
and check whether it is branded

148
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
repetitive pattern
optimism and despair.

149
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,300
It is not poorly.

150
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:33,000
I hope that someday
emancipation and search for ...

151
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,900
I do not do?

152
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,600
You AEOI to this
housing and Pulling him here by tugging the æ!

153
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:40,400
- It does not work as a
- I know, how does it work?

154
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,900
As soon wykopaliœcie me to school were
military also did not co-operative I will show the shampoo of the votes!

155
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:47,600
When a child becomes for you
the UCI be obtained, it kicks it!

156
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:51,000
Francis, it's not your business,
already do not live here!

157
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,500
Because I wykopaliœcie!

158
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,600
Now do the same with Reese!

159
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:01,300
He sits now in the house of the cable,
stack of video games and is nieszczêœliwy!

160
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,000
If there is a nieszczêœliwy,
This alone is provoked!

161
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,500
So 10 times he is provoked?

162
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,300
And Malcolm provoked it 6 times
with my 28 blows out

163
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,600
40 dug out of the house,
3 different Debt children

164
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:18,400
and are the only fixed the variable
We are the two of you!

165
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,100
Francis, it's not fair!

166
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,800
You also do not want dzieliæ
home with creative Child Lock!

167
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,900
So when Dewey himself to provoke?

168
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:30,200
When Jamie?
Where is Jamie?

169
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,900
- In a babysitter.

170
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,000

/ Zwróæ me are my godnoœæ!

171
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,800
/ Okay, wey the godnoœæ,
/ But let me widywaæ with the children!

172
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,500
/ Just pull the the trigger!

173
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,300
/ He turns her on the ound on!

174
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,800
/ Come on, do not the DY coward and do it!

175
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,300
Dave, is that you?

176
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:58,600
/ Yes.

177
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,100
Which channels are watching you give?
Sounds better than what I have.

178
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,100
/ Lucille Armstrong
/ Doctor of Psychology

179
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:13,000
It's for us .. new situation.

180
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,100
Never previously not egzaminowaliœmy
our parenting.

181
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:23,400
We thought also that something
what comes naturally.

182
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,400
Yes, the animals on the planet
had children were billions of years.

183
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:30,100
Let us take in also, I never had the s
zajêæ of education, and there are not full.

184
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,600
How exactly do you want,
Eby ¿I help you?

185
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:39,200
Popadliœmy in the habit of that.

186
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,700
Our sons are poorly we behave,
So we punish them.

187
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,900
Later, the act even worse,
So we punish them severely.

188
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,700
And then keep up the men chose
bizarre, surprising as poorly,

189
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,600
and if we byœmy them so punished,
This landed the dowalibyœmy in jail!

190
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,300
- End the options we have.
- Of course, also like that.

191
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,900
We hope, also thanks to your training,

192

may want you nauczyæ of us jakiejœ
subtle tricks, ¿Eby their powstrzymaæ.

193
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:04,700

- Yeah.

194
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,900
Jakiegoœ secret

which calms the to them and makes the,
Also the bed we listen.

My husband ¹ ¿ages, but
are still being deal with them one by one,

197
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,700
but as if the connecting forces y ..

198
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:20,500
You can not traktowaæ children as
criminals, or how furious the e animals.

199
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,900
Do not know Did you come to our sons.

200
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,700
¿I can not imagine what the ck are capable of.

201
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:30,600
I am a psychologist for 40 years.
I do not surprise already.

202
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:37,600
All right.
In some foreign Zesz week, Reese ...

203
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,500
Oh, my God, why would he were cats?

204
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,900
- We do not know.
- Give me a minute.

205
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:50,000
Even in the most extreme
deny the smokers breath,

206
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,100
terrible cases
acting certain techniques.

207
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,200
He says the I, also do not
waste of 90 bucks.

208
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,900
S ³ s yszeliœcie of the active uchaniu?

209
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:02,100
No.

210
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:06,100
Most teenagers behaves poorly,
Suggest as are also no one on them depends not y

211
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:10,400
The active are the uchaniu repeat
everything the child says,

212
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:14,800
which shows that the you are listening to it
and at the same time understand.

213
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I know it sounds corny,
but trust me, it works wonders.

214
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:21,400
Reese probably would not reacted to the.

215
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:25,200
- Worried sure that the he can not help.
- Yeah, and what if matters worse?

216
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,800
I do not know whether the stand k For more troubles with it.

217
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,800

218
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:36,100
Yes, I am. Usually
I'm so confident,

00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:39,600
but by t the wonder Affairs
over each time the aspect of ...

220
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:47,100
This is good.
This is very good.

221
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:52,800
I've understandable that the blue
it is not wrong color,

222
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:56,200
but also is the color of hope.

223
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,300
Yes, I finished the.

224
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,500

steak that You attempted zjeœæ?

304
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:29,700
Thinking of EOE, also is not possible,
but the venom of EOE slowly and you succeeded Fr

I can upichciæ frittata in 10 minutes?

318
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:18,600
It is immaculate.

319
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,600
Reese przyszliœmy zrobiæ something here.

320
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:27,100
I do not agree that our instinct
and even now, I do not feel good about it,

321
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:31,700
but ... as that the last instinct
fails us, so I'll say it.

322
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:32,800
What is it?

323
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:37,300
Reese, I love you and We believe that
Also will be better if I stay here.

324

00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,100
Honestly said the c

time are going to minors than in school.

In 2471.

340
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,700
As early as 3000 I fracture of receivables

341
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,800
/ From my Federal Charter
/ Bank card to Spring Mill,

342
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,300
because I have a $ 8,000 limit there.

343
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,200
But ever since the of K d is the OCI with you

You are using a credit card?
How much will the EOE?

00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:51,200
10, 11 thousand. But are still being
far from the $ 20 000 limit.

349
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,400
How can the EOE spend it all so much in 10 days!

350
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,600
I bought the oven with convection,

351
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,400
and then the refrigerator looks as of and with him miserably.

352
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,000
Well, I must kupowaæ new clothes,
When looking to the Dirty contacts.

353
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:04,200
I have a big bell in the bathroom.
And, how do you do it?

354
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:10,500
Reese, I owe you an Acknowledgement
for giving me confidence.

very little about, I'll wymyœlaæ punishment.

356
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,700
Ideas were already flies to me by the
your head, it's very at exciting.

357
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,300
But I do not want AAE operates lightly
and thus we rozczarowaæ.

358
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:26,100
- Incurring gniesz me so at home?
- We take only your ear.

359

Like the rest of the ¿wants AEOI,
This is the card may e

361
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,200

362
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,300
Something must robiæ well, because the pop-

363
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,600

help others. See ya.

372
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,000
Stanford, the poor dude.

373
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:12,400
You probably do not know that the faculty of Astrophysics
takes only three in the country.
