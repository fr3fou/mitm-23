I do not know if it was to be a punishment for us

15
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,600

Probably a little of each.

He's dying. You wymyœliæ

28
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,200
I will lose all of the friends,
when I went to the class brainiacs.

29
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,300
- We all hate us!
- We had better in this class.

30
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,900
We had computers, microscope
electron seismograph.

31
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,600
That's why they hated us.

32
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,400

But I'm not the moaners,

50
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,300
Malcolm is a genius,
Now Dewey is a genius?

51
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,600
The issue of time is
find the genius in me.

52
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:45,600
I wonder what I'm a genius?

00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:58,300
Ok, the question of the 17 sounded:
"Street is the bees as:

That's the anniversary of, right?

From where they have ... Know-it?

00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,200
How to ... Do you remember?

63
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,600
That's it. That's good, because only in this way
Dewey classes we protect against the brainiacs.

64
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,300
Why ... can not e ..

68
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,900
Guys, guys! I used to try

and I finally understandable,
I should also AEOI to the library!

Yes!

76

Finally, we are ready.
I did not want to speak anything earlier.

Hal, do not train so you ¿ko,

84
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:37,700
No, you just walk idiots
because it is a competition for children.

85
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,300
Nowhere is this written.
3 times I read the rules!

And we aim less important than the limit,
You can store zadzwoniæ to the manufacturer.

87

If you write exactly

00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:33,100
means that you need a little more
special help than other children.

00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,200
- Mrs. Walsh?
- I can help somehow something?

153
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,800
I'm Malcolm, brother Dewey.

154
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,200
I wanted to porozmawiaæ
the test as you write the Dewey.

155
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,300
I can only rozmawiaæ the parents.

156
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:24,200
In precisely the point. I'll be the laughing
great being inconvenienced, for the same coming of here

157
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,800
but I must tell
why test so he came out of.

158
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,500
Our mother has a problem with the pressure dependence.

159
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,100
Mia ³ a ¿ny Pote recurrence of
morning when I write the test.

160
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,300
O my God e

161
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,700
Therefore, there can Know-that the there was to em.

162
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:42,400
I do not want tell that the groyne is,
because ... you know, my mom and I love her the.

163
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:46,700
Wow. It can, that the very
care for a family of his.

164
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:50,400
- It's very difficult.
- See what I can zrobiæ, right?

165
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,400
You do not have the angle of opotaæ your mom.

166
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:54,200
Thanks.

167
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,900
I'll be just contact their dad are.
Thanks for the warning.

168
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,700
Wow, 10 messages from advisors
Dewey. I guess I should ...

169
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:04,000
Æwiczyæ, ¿ebyœmy won.

170
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:04,900
Right.

171
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,900
5, 6, 7, 8 ..
1, 2, 3 and 4 ..

172
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:13,200
You the sticks, rear sticks
and œlizg and œlizg.

173
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,600
These shoes for dancing
greatly help in the speed.

174
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,200
I wasted no of the 150 bucks.

175
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,800
- Hal.
- Here comes the Yoko.

176
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,600
It's five in the morning, do not sleep the entire EOE the night.

177
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:27,600
Honey, I also think this
g the pole and you think that the again fall into trance,

178
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,800
but this situation is
different than the previous one.

179
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,900
I have a gift, Lois.

180
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,100
And b of the EDEM would would not use it.

181
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:37,600
Right.
So weszliœmy in the second phase.

182
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,300
Will be fine until
We will comply with the rule.

183
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,800
You have to walk perfectly well to work!
You jeœæ!

184
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,600
You can not engage ¿owaæ children.

185
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,100
I cut off my access to the joint account.

186
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,400
He will do the am this week.
Goodnight Fred, Ginger.

187
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,700
I was thinking of that the it was Fred and Barney.

188
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,100
WeŸcie handkerchief and gently
zakrêæcie, ¿Eby zrobiæ flower.

189
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:06,300
Later Make a bouquet
Carefully angle of the ad tio.

190
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,500
Work slowly, it is not wyœcig.

191
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,400
Why do we use the only tissue?

192
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,900
Because they are soft and non-toxic.

193
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,800
In this way, no one
hurt, and no one will sue the school y

194
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,200
This program can not pozwoliæ
themselves for the next process, Dewey.

195
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,800
Now the wage I can only
for four days a week.

196
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:25,200
But that g the pole. We learn
of mathematics without the pencils,

197
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,800
And the story we have no
¹ ¿ek book in hardcover.

198
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,900
We'll get although the
equipment for the plastics?

199
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,500
Instruments for plastics,
This among other things, no advances and glue.

200
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,300
These children are up dŸgaj
knives scissors and eat the glue.

201
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:40,200
Some tried to do zjeœæ s advances.
And he wanted to dŸgaæ glue.

202
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,700
Teachers should pomagaæ students.

203
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:46,300
May not be the byœ the nieszczêœliwy,
If you were the more you try.

204
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:51,600
Listen to S, Dewey, do not survive
years of this attitude.

205
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:56,000
You pozbieraæ all
hopes and dreams and their umrzeæ Daae.

206
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,700
Then I may not have finished
c are staring up at the clock at 4 am,

207
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,000
¿And the mouth of the c that the whole is not half the EOE
So you're the NEB in college.

208
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,600
Thanks, also tried to EOE.

209
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:12,200
I promise that the you get the
glue it to go zadŸgam.

210
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:19,200
And then been hacked
and eaten by wolves.

211
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,300
Because that's going on with the children,
that by tugging the for in the hair.

212
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,400
- What are you doing here?
/ - Malcolm, who came of?

213
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:30,600
Do not worry, he will do the am
master's degree in troubleshooting.

214
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:31,400
Somehow something I can help you?

215
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,500
My name is Walsh
I am an advisor to the Dewey.

216
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:36,900
First, let me tell,
how much I admire your courage to the.

217
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,000
Thank you.

218
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,500
- Your son Malcolm came the odwiedziæ me.
- Not true.

219
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:45,200
Let me take care of this æ ¹. Worries of up
including that the Dewey landed in the planter of the the above class.

220
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,700
Malcolm, as œmia the EOE!
EOE He expressed himself clearly,

221
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,800
but did not have the right EOE
robiæ czegoœ that.

222
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,200
The fact is,
Also browsed through the assessment Dewey am

223
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,700
and the result does not reflect the
results in the classroom.

224
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,200
These are the basis for the repeat test.

225
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:01,700
Oh no! Absolutely not!
Do not answer that to my son.

226
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,800
The curtain is used the to be in this class!
He needs to be in this class!

227
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,500
No I think that I will not be fighting |.

228
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,300
No future am, ¿Eby zdenerwowaæ you.

229
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,700
No one wants
¿Lose the ebyœ and precise control over each other.

230
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:16,100
You'll see how they lose control if
not leave Dewey where he belongs!

231
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,300
Believe me, I do not want to
t zadzieraæ of the family are!

232
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,600
You can also talk to a month of the,
how you will feel stronger.

233
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,300
I can reveal a
at your meetings.

234
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,800
It is incredible how this woman says to you hit them!

235
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,500
Really I unsuccessfully tried to
utrzymaæ Dewey away from class brainiacs,

236
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,300
but did not have a right to do so!

237
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,800
Shut up already!

238
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,400
No I think that you do not have the hassle k,
because your an evil plan did not work out of.

239
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:50,100
/ Hypnotist, the archbishop, the dictator,
/ Conservator knows ¿HUNTERS, bliŸniak,

240
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:53,800
/ Refractory talk to the months of
/ Animals, seeing the months through walls, negotiator.

241
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,100
That was about œwietne!
Which are your children?

242
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:09,900
Those two.

243
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:17,300
Certainly landed the dujecie
on my screen saver.

244
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,500
Do not worry, Hal.

245
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,500
It quickly feel the like
g the stupidly thinking we were on the appearance of the day.

246
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,500
- Let's rock!
- Yeah.

247
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,200
I was thinking of that it will be
have the same costume.

248
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:30,900
S are almost identical.

249
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:40,200
I twist the ankle. Once again,
anniversary of em too close to the S of the sun.

250
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,200
- But we tañczyæ.
- I can not, Hal.

251
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:46,800
But you have to. Too long
and you ¿ko trenowaliœmy, ¿Eby odpuœciæ.

252
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,900
The Ides there and win this coupon
on average two free pizzas!

253
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,800
For both of us.

254
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,900
I know that is not what the zgadzaliœmy
time that this sanctification of em

255
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:08,100
but no one else
from what I can of doing this.

256
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,400
- What do you think?
- Oh, Hal.

257
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,300
- I take pizza.
- Approx.

258
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,000
Œlepy coming revolution,
I can not patrzeæ.

259
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,600
For each an outsider
This person looks as ridiculous.

260
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,000
We lost him, Lois.
It belongs to everyone.

261
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:38,600
Mr. Sheridan, why motorcycles
is the way, when he approaches the aj are the in and out?

262
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,900
Hanson, I try to jeœæ lunch.

263
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:45,200
By the time you are manufac the interpreter,
forget it's still questions.

264
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,700
It seems to me that the my brother Malcolm
explained the manufac of me Zesz of the former year.

265
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,600
"The Doppler Effect, Dewey.

266
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,400
Both the sound and light of
-moving with constant velocity are the,

267
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,600
but the waves are short and long-Longer.

268
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,900
Depending on whether or not to move the
in your direction or not.

269
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,300
Now, of bed pants
you were a freak. "

270
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:20,800
My imaginary friends
They were right! I am a genius!

271
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:26,100
He says the c proœciej point is
Also will sound waves from motorcycle

272
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:29,200
Moving away from him are the same number of
the speed in all directions.

273
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:34,100
And when the Keep clear to you,
that are more gêœciej of the deposit they

274
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,100
So frequency goes up
and you sound becomes longer.

275
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:38,500
EOE understandable?

276
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:46,900
Yeah, I understandable. Oh, my God also?
I taught czegoœ up!

I taught czegoœ up!
I taught czegoœ up!

280

Can not you should have nothing to

281
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,300
Sit down and b are each quiet!

Everyone who hates the, for me the.

283
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,600

I am very pleased
Also contest is already behind you are.

288
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,000
Yeah.

289

Now, if you are already free,
This Potrzebowo in low help with Jamie.

290
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,300
There ¿s narrowed the eye through the whole night.

291

So, as if you took the first of the
Changing today at night, ...

He buys it!

295
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,200
Ok, Dewey. I have a new,
large with a better plan.

296
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,300
In the break I was up to the principal's office
and I created a second, fictional Dewey,

297
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,700
