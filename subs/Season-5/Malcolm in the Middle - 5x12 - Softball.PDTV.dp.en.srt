176
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,900
He was already em in the middle of the road,

177
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,500
when I was suddenly reminded of himself,
Also when I had the three year old became sick Did you come to,

180
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:55,700
Lazy? Do not think so.

181
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,100
I'm not leaving until I
do not apologize.

182
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,500
You just want an apology?
That's the point of the?

183
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,200
You should tell this to the

- All right?
- Do not. Not all right!

186
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,100
This is not the apology.

187
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,600
These are just some of the
cleverly constructed apology

188
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,900
which sounds like the apology,
but they are not.

189

Now you przeprosiæ for an apology.
And then przeprosiæ!

190

You know what your problem is?

191
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,200
Do you know why you do not accept
my apology?

192
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,300
Because you can not feel up szczêœliwy!

193
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,900

00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:47,500
³ I will come back here because you Did you come to destroy the chances of

I guess I'm an international spy
and do not even know on which side I was on.

216

Too bad. Of course, the biggest
losers are the fans.
