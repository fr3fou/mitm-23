72
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,900

78
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:31,400

Your car would not be the full tion of bees.

84
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,400
Coincidence.

85
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,400
Craig, with the break of EOE feet,
c search for the phone number for me.

86

Thank you.

89
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,900
I wanted to tell,

- Ok, You can store jechaæ.
/ - Sir, it's dead tree is not?

91
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:14,800
Of course, also not.

Upewniliœmy sure that the world also œciêto trees,
were in immediately to the ground, ¿Eby had were large on the water.

93
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:24,300
Your tree is suspended
nor in the abyss, between life ¿and death.

94
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,200
Hold the c until you open presents.

95
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
How many trees we sold?

96
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,300
- 15
- 15?

97
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,900
We are not even close to 67
I do not understand this!

98
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,300
We are a good location,
Use the correct tree.

99
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:42,000
- Excuse me, after how many Christmas trees?

100
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,200
- Oh.

101
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:47,200
Churches of St. Make the corner,
sells for $ 17,

102
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:50,100
but there is a long service line,
Think of So I'll try also with you.

103
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,700
Can you believe that the churches of the snowdrop us?

104
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,400
I have never offered a mass for half-price!

105
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:01,500
Why we have not lowered prices we aim?
For example, for $ 16.

106
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:05,500
Then earn on average $ 31
per tree and a total of $ 3457.

107
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Wyszlibyœmy to its original ... wait ...

110
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,600

00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,800
Traditionally given to
tip to the one who fixed.

115
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:35,500
That was a tree number ... 79!

116
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:39,600
We are very close.
Ch of boys, I love you all.

117
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,900
But this kid ...

118
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,200
It's just a light bite.
He'll be fine?

119
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,100
Absolutely.

120
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,100
But I need injections to wœciekliznê.

121
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,600
- Injections?
- 5 uk the UAE in the stomach.

122
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,600
I had of them a few years
I take a bite of this skunk.

123
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,700
When they put the first
10 centimeters ¹ ê needle in my belly,

124
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,200
This sensitive em like I got shot.

125
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:05,100
How to cut the gnêli the latest,
This le ¿³ em and on the floor

126
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,600
, keeping the legs up from the chair and
and to cry the c, like a child!

127
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,800
The Navy taught us
znosiæ as pain, but ...

128
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,600
not as many as that.

129
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:20,500
Always you can with Grip the
Squirrel and zanieœæ to the vet.

130
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,400
How will not have a wœcieklizny,
This will avoid injections.

131
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:27,700
No, I'll take the injections,
Lois otherwise, proves his thesis are!

132
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,500
Craig, Listen to me.

133
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,800
I promise you.

134
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:36,600
In the background are catching a squirrel, I'll take to the vet
and to prove that there is no wœcieklizny.

135
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,300
¯ ¹ ³ ebyœ avoid these injections!

136
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,300
Already we will never suffer the
through it, also do you know me?

137
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,300
EOE understandable?

138
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,900
- You're standing on my foot.
- I'm sorry.

139
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,700
- You are still the OC of K ¹?
- Yes, it's a fascinating hands.

140
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,200
I had the same as the angle of the canvas
a million times in my ¹ I ¹.

141
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,900
For a while she will say:
"Do not take that tone with me."

142
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,600
And he will krzyczeæ.

143
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,600
Now the father tries to reconcile them.

144
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,800
And he is for this to get it.

145
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:19,800
/ It will be good ..

146
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,600
Whose involvement in the k œ the canvas,
¿Eby rozdrapaæ old wounds.

147
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,200
This is a primitive version of my family.

148
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:35,200
- Take a step to the left.
- Why?

149
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,100
Weirdly.

150

Whatever you give of the churches,
we will double it!

180
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,200
You can double the eternal salvation?

00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,100
No one will give us rozstawiæ trees.

186
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:42,900
Unbelievable! We thought that the
cemetery will be a good place?

187
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,900
Can we'll be salesman
you straight from the bulb?

188
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:50,900
You would have to take into account the æ
fuel price. 2 km per liter of fuel ...

189
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,500
Malcolm, let ¹ æ genius rest.

190
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:58,300
We are so close.
89 trees!

00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,600
Only two of the lack of profit.

00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,100
Story of my life!

193
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,100
Not important what they do,
not important how hard you try, ...

194
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,900
always miss two trees.

00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,600
Give him a hat.

201
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,700
People, somewhere in the store is a squirrel.

202
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,200
It is agile, elusive
and probably has wœciekliznê.

But her are from the apiemy!

205
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:47,100
Too long is quiet.
It has something planowaæ.

206

without losing the remnants of one's own
value of denial.

278

If I give up pokonaæ one of failure,
This would end the one child.

You are you still count on a miracle.

And if a miracle does not appear
on Public holidays, when?
