Wow.
This is a real breakthrough, Abe.

It already was to the front, all

Today we go to the Indian reservation,
and then to Ben and Jerry's.

111
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:26,500
It may not be our vision of romance,
but very well they made the UK.

112
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:30,000
And I was always thinking of that the dating
people, it is a recipe for disaster.

in the culture of Mexico.

146

Clean socks.

153
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,000
Yes!
Szczêœliwa sweatshirt wins again.

154
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,600
This is not szczêœliwa sweatshirt.

155
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,400
You should not krytykowaæ things
you do not understand, Malcolm.

156
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,800
This blouse, with ordinary small fabric
made of atoms.

157
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:07,300
- Szczêœliwych atoms.
- There is no carbon szczêœliwych!

158
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,000
Each has jakiœ
type szczêœcia, Malcolm.

159
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,600
You have them in solving tests.

160
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,700
All the time handcuffed,
¿Eby have good grades!

161
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:17,200
Why are you so furious
by the szczêœliw are my blouse?

162
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,000
Because I believe in this nonsense,

163
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:22,000
m not the smart, healthy,
not good for society!

164
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,900
Light does not work thanks
magic or superstition the house!

165
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,100
But thanks to the logic.

166
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,200
Can you believe it,
just because you're good at myœleniu.

167
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,900
If the world was not the logical
It's not to say the byœ.

168
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,200
Right. You know what, Dewey?
With the ap it.

169
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,500
It ... does not prove anything.

170
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,600
/ I do not believe that the meet up with someone else.

171
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,500
And he said this,
if it was to no big deal.

172
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:52,100
He added and that the do not want to be trapped!
Trapped! Can you believe it?

173
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,600
Yes, I do. I had a little bit of time,
¿Eby is przemyœleæ, Abe.

174
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:59,300
You said to me about it two times in the night
and even today, as they drove to work the EOE.

175
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,200
I feel his presence, Hal.
Its scent.

176
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,300
Imagine it, Hal.
I want, ¿ebyœ to imagine myself of!

177
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:09,600
Her lips in the mouth of another
¿husband man. Not mine.

178
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,500
What is the ego in my mouth?

179
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,100
I would like to Know-who it is.

180
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,700
We'll find out who it is.
You will find his infernal the Nore i .. i ..

181
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,600
He will probably make a few
still pictures and ubieraæ start to like him.

182
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,200
You must be at jakieœ guess.
Suggest, Lois Suggest!

183
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,500
Craig, you're driving me to lower the u!

184
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:34,200
I'm sorry, you're right,
the absolute right.

185
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,800
It is rich? S the Orthodox?
Athletic?

186
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,300
A well-built? M are smart?
Skinny?

187
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:45,400
Is it expands Intrinsic
forces and an iron and has the will to ¿?

188
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:48,900
It's not fair.
Why are my must have a woman?

189
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:53,500
About Bo ¿e .. Is not this miêœniak,
which holds the tire in the calendar?

190
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:57,400
I can not with this rywalizowaæ!
How can I with this rywalizowaæ?

191
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:01,600
I have his books are the tablespoon ¿jokes,
But it sounds through it the unreal.

192
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:06,600
Why did God give me the skosztowaæ
paradise, ¿so that I now answer it to me?

193
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,100
God hates me.

194
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,100
- I'm so nieszczêœliwy.
- I'm so nieszczêœliwy.

195
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:17,100
- You have to choose, Polly.
- I can not.

196
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:20,600
Are still being try, but it is not the easy.

197
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,600
He says the c honestly, Lois, as a woman,

198
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,400
want you can select the
between Craig and Abe?

199
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:30,400
Well ¿... Fortunately, I do not need to
podejmowaæ such a difficult decision.

200
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,500
But more importantly,
Polly, you have to.

201
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,700
But that's impossible.

202
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:40,000
For each time, when compared to their
advantages and disadvantages, it comes out a tie.

203
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:45,600
Craig is just the Security of the sexual
themselves and fantasies.

204
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:50,800
Abe is cordial, polite and gets
extra point, because it is black.

205
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,000
Simply put, without subtext.

206
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,600
In addition, all complicated by the fact

207
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:57,900
I'm also the most
the CYM exciting time of life.

208
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,400
- And I do not want him skoñczyæ.
- Polly ...

209
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,800
I'm sorry, but I must AEOI.

210
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,000
I'm going with Craig play in Laser Tag

211
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,100
and then from Abe to the bakery for cheesecake.

212
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,700
If society at large
there was to the conservative,

213
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,500
This would be the Solution.

214
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,900
Ok, we will have
Decisions are taken æ ¹ behind her.

215
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,600
I agree.

216
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,200
- Nak the onisz Abe for forgiveness?
- What?

217
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,700
Why Abe? You can overlay the onisz
Craig for forgiveness?

218
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,700
Craig out by means of breaks. Abe
survive, it is more mature the y

219
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,200
- He's asleep with in the connected one main light source, Lois!
- Eight hours, Hal!

220
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:32,400
For eight hours I will be watching the will of a,
Craig æwiczy Mine revenge.

221
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,100
Wait, wait, this is crazy.
We should not sprzeczaæ up.

222
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,500
We should not to mix old.

223
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:40,100
You're right, you're right.
Both of them are our friends of me.

224
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,800
- One of them is the same collapse.
- Exactly.

225
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,800
I would like only the crap
AAE ¿the idea of ??sex.

226
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
/ Pete Bucowski
/ Never never discouraged.

227
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,900
Even if you have been zes of any
to a lower league after the fifth time you!

228
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:57,000
Just shrug of his shoulders,
uœmiechn ¹ ³ and he said:

229
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,700
"The problem? What's the problem?"
It's saying.

230
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,200
- I got the goose bumps.
- Great, Mom.

231
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,800
- We look for Reggie Jackson.
- Okay, but do not miss Pete Bucowskiego.

235

Therefore God is the invention of baseball.

236
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:21,900
War.

237

Shut up, Dewey!
You know what?

244
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,800
How to win the kiss of kisses
Reese's ass on that stage.

245
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,200
Hammer down.
Without turning back.

246
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,100
Right.

Polly?

254
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,900
What an incredible
coincidence of circumstances.

- Part of Craig.

256

Polly, leave Ami and idŸcie

266
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:59,200
I think the experience of OBE,
or experience outside of the body I,

267
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:03,700
of which my shaman was to be very
proud, but now probably faint.

268
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,300
- With the grabs you, baby.

No, Hal. He will do me the
fool for the last time!

276
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,100
Craig, do not do it!

I will not stand idly by when the

278
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,700
Oh my God, kill the the up!

Because when my husband ¿man is hungry,
it wants jeœæ immediately.

And my job is to

Do not change the aperture Services
in something, which the hose of regret.
