1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:03,700
- You have to change the diapers Jamie.
- I want of doing this!

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:05,500
Even you!
We had a robiæ you to change.

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:08,300
Mom and he said that the Jamie
the ³ ¹ ³ kn her diamond earring.

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,800
Whoever finds it
get a $ 20 reward.

5
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,600
Let Reese has a chance,
long time do not do the.

6
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:14,800
Damn!

7
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:18,100
Men chose not noticeably lived that the mother
no diamond earrings.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,300
It smells like a ticket to the easy life!

9
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:26,500
Crazy world of Malcolm
5x08 "Feast Street"

10
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:29,400
{Y: b} T the interpreter: MoszeUsz

00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,400
Synchro to version PDTV.XviD-LOL:
512x384 23.976fps 174.4 MB

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,200
Since five years, every year, spending
a week in a cottage by the lake.

13
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,000
This year's trip will fail the
and come back three days earlier.

14
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,300
I'm just saying that the do not ask for much.

15
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,400
Once a year,
one wants to œæ on the porch,

16
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,700
gapiæ on the flash
and jeœæ sandwiches on the container.

17
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:13,700
The problem is
Also cool the boys are gentle.

18
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,200
The would be useful to them
little interaction with the nature.

19
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,000
I blame video games.

20
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:27,800
/ What's going on?

21
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,300
- Sorry, but the street is closed.
- We live here, what's happening?

22
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,700
You live and you do not know?

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,800
- The annual Feast of the street.
- Annual?

24
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,800
Every year, from five years.

25
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,200
Part of Lloyd.
What's going on?

26
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,300
Hal.
Earlier wróciliœcie.

27
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,600
What is this?
Why did not we know about it?

28
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:57,200
Well ¿... wyszliœmy morning from home, our sun
the lights on, people began to rozmawiaæ.

29
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,800
- Is the higher of the spontaneously.
- According to the inscription, it is already five times.

30
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,700
Office of the Feast of the street dzacie
Every year when we do not have?

31
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,000
No I am responsible for the planning.

32
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,900
It's a whole committee that cares ...
I will not be boring you of.

33
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,200
Polly, so wróciliœmy earlier.

34
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,000
We can wpaœæ and podrzuciæ
Jamie for a few hours?

35
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,500
We have a street Feast
and we want to entertain.

36
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,400
Great, thanks.

37
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,200
Entertain! No one other than
I do not understand?

38
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,700
And the whole neighborhood hates us!

39
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,900
So much so that the devices are your ¹
big party when we do not have.

40
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:42,000
Malcolm, it's pretty nowoœæ ¿.
I'm surprised you are also organized.

41
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,200
You do not mind,
Also despise all of us are?

42
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,800
No. People in need
be on someone lived.

43
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,600
Nienawiœæ us of the whole or the surrounding area.

44
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:53,100
My mother is right, son. Groups
Find people are common enemies.

45
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,700
If not us,
This znaleŸliby someone else.

46
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,800
Probably like the minority œ.

47
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,800
Malcolm, you can not whole e
Martwiæ force other sentence.

48
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,400
Can you lubiæ, nienawidziæ,

49
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,500
or even something else,
and then you die.

50
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:09,400
- It had the rozweseliæ me?
- I do not know why you need it.

51
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,800
You're a teenager
the fete at the door.

52
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,300
You can zostaæ and striving saæ up as
you want, but we're going up entertain.

53
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,200
Come on, baby.
O my God e Parade mowers

54
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,200
Part, Otto.
What is this?

55
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:29,800
It's called "pokrywacz".
This artificial cow's rump.

56
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:33,700
This will allow us wydobyæ
precious seed of Bruno.

57
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,300
The cost me a fortune,
but here is the j are those kernels!

58
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,500
We can not simply go
wpuœciæ to cows?

59
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:47,500
No! Bruno is too rough for
my girls, one of the living in a bubble.

60
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:51,100
Most of them ashamed of milking.

61
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,600
- I shall be had to it do?
- It's not as bad as you think.

62
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,000
You only inputs to the center.

63
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,700
Bruno you will pay, offer your the
mêskoœæ and score semen.

64
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,300
It's a million times worse than I was thinking of!

65
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,700
Francis, there is nothing to be afraid of.

66
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,800
I wonder why they gave to the goggles?

67
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,300
/ They were students
/ Class Mrs. Michelson.

68
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,900
I speak on behalf of all
with maple and Jefferson.

69
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,400
The whole area is a large on
The nicer this time of year!

70
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,500
No, no.
Carry on.

71
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,400
And so already skoñczyliœmy.

72
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Never thinking of em about us, as the most
hated people in the area.

73
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,400
Dewey, most of the people
force passes through unnoticed.

74
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,900
Their names are not in the newspapers,
the name of the rights does not come from them.

75
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,600
It is sufficient majority of people,
but I want more.

76
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:11,900
Hey!

77
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:16,900
This is not always the easy.

78
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,900
Will not have many
the friends, the bed c unpopular.

79
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,700
Someday with you
count, Reese!

80
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:27,200
What is it?

81
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,000
This kid toss of me
the excellent idea!

82
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:35,000
We do not do this often.
Do not walk on the area.

83
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,700
I'm on the right?

84
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:41,100
Do you remember what was to
jakieœ 20 years ago?

85
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,500
Issued a $ 70 EOE, ¿Eby wygraæ for
plush me the mascot worth the $ 3.

86
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,700
Especially does that have little hoops.

87
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:50,500
If I did not play to the effect of,
that it would not have learned.

88
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,500
Besides, I did not try the up
wygraæ plush mascot.

89
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,000
I used to try wygraæ you.

90
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,500
Oh, Hal.

91
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:04,500
I urge all of you to keep
peace and enjoy the sights.

92
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,100
/ Otherwise, they
/ And their children win the awful!

93
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,600
- Let me help you.
- You do not have robiæ.

94
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,500
No problem.
Willing to help.

95
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,800
Thank you, I the of of you.

96
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,100
Really?
Can I have something for you do?

97
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:31,100
I'm just saying that the children should not be
winiæ out by means of terrible parents.

98
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,500
If Saddam Hussein had the son ...

99
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,900
This may not the best example, but ...

100
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,500
Son, I do not worry about it
according to others.

101
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,700
You're a very caring young baby m³ Men Everywhere are.

102
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,500
Thank you. I'm glad
Also you know of em!

103
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,600
Hey!
What are you doing!

104
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,200
- Who was the man of the man!
- What, you mean?

105
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,600
Oh, my God also?
Robbed!

106
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,300
Fixed EOE here when robs us of!

107
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,300
Move the hose, and he Potrzebowo the help!

108
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,500
- The EOE'll help him!
- The barely copes!

109
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,200
And you believe the EOE, also his house!

110
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,800
No, he said that exactly.

111
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,800
That was a guess.
I have so much to g half!

112
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,900
You're in this family
out of the house, right?!

113
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,900
- Yes, but I'm not like them!
- You know what to do the EOE!

114
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,100
Something you think you're thinking of!

115
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,700
I just wanted to, Eby ¿³ someone like me!

116
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,200
Thank you, Jim.

117
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:47,600
Already for a few minutes will take place
5-eating contest of heavy bass!

Eating contest of heavy bass?

I remember a certain the girl
the tail, which can flow zjeœæ dozen.

122
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:02,100
- That was a long time ago, Hal.
- Do not complainers, Lois.

123
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:05,100
A woman has reached the peak
¿capacity of the stomach of your age.

124
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,900
Sign up along with you.
I think that the failures you are afraid to book with me.

125
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:13,800
Hal, you are good in many
things, but it's the bass heavy.

126
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,500
Let's go.

127
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,700
This lizard,
or were no alligator.

128
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:23,500
Swims in our cesspool of the month.
Unless the feeds up heaps.

129
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,900
- Where is he?
- Hi all.

130

132
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,400
- How the Offer, Reese?
- Good question, Dewey.

133
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,600
We all know,
Also torturing you for years.

134
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,100
Some of you May the
scar on the outside of a body

135
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,900
Some of you are damaging the
in places where you can not see.

136
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,800
Each one of you wants revenge.
And you know what?

137
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,700
You got that right.

138
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:00,500
Reese, revenge is œwietnie.
But how can we to do?

139
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,200
Another customs question, Dewey.

140
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:07,000
For $ 20 I ¿DEMU each of you the opportunity to
beat me by 30 seconds.

141
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,500
Reese is tempting the hand.

142
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,900
But how do we Know-the,
That after the way you have been accumulated,

143
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:17,300
- You will not get us tomorrow?
- That's the best part.

144
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:21,100
For all the time I'll be had of the complexities associated eye.

145
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,300
Registration will start to inevitably carry garage for I hour.

146
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,200
I will not tell you from where they took the æ money.

147
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,100
May we have your the purse.

148
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,200
Except you, Freddy.
Your journey is called ¿ny strip.

149
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,100
All set?

150
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,500
I think so.

151
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,600

155
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,500
And then can
move your hips a little,

157
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,400
I hope that you will support the fire.

158
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,700
It s important than 1800 kg.

159
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:11,400
As he runs out of patience,
This can uderzyæ from the destructive forces are.

160
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,000
I want ¿ki increases.

Not only are sitting!
The whole world!

164
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:32,200
The way you treat the people themselves,
why it must be!

165
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:35,200
There is so much hatred!

166
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,500
What about pulling out of hair?

167
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,400
No, g words will obstruct the oniêta.
Too much of this do you think.

168
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,400
Let nienawiœæ will lead your body em.

Note that $ 20 must zostaæ
a taxi to the hospital.

173
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,700
I'm going to spend it all on the head of stupidity!

174
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,200
It's the best nation in the world!

175
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,000
Today we have a beautiful day

176

/ And start five brothers contest
/ Stavis in the eating heavy bass!

177
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,100
I will try to jeœæ
¿them without any interruptions.

178
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,500
The space between the heavy bass,
tell the body, also is full.

179
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,700
This year we are our old friends:

180
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,100

Big Tony!

183
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,400

189
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,200

Eat ¿d ¿aj hence the!
I'll give you this bag.

191
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,800
You do not need bags.

192
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,600
But I wanted to listen to the statue, and sings.

193
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:57,200
/ Well, ladies and gentlemen.
/ We lost Jerry and Jackson,

194
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,400

196
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,400
Ma ³ e upgrade,
Lois is a ³ ¿ate t the ninth!

197
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,400
You're awesome!

/ And we lost Louie'go.

199
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,800
- Unbelievable!
- What's going on?

200
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Hal and Lois struggling
with the great Tony in the eb eb!

201
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,500
Wait a minute.
¿Is that the end for Lois?

202
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,200
No, I want to dock the bookmark sauerkraut.

203
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,400
He was a theft and helped to em.

204
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,300
No charges will bring,
we want the zapomnieæ.

205
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,800
And so you have to jechaæ to the police station,
fill the few papers.

206
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,800
Does not look like that the large bending of the Father

207
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,300
Just a little trash in the garage u

208
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,500
It is difficult to tell what exactly.

209
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,700
I can tell.
I have a photographic memory in the.

210
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,800
Replacing all
which was to the car.

Can we call and say later?

212
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,800
He was about nine boxes of.
35 to 30 to 50 centimeters.

213
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,600
Computer, two high-
quality color printers.

214
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:16,800
Signature machine, the machine
to the manufac virtual consoles, two bottles of ink.

215
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:21,500
The three reams of paper of high quality
with fluorescent in the windows security.

216
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,900
You can swim them in ¿
for counterfeiting money.

217
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,500
But you do not need
machines for manufac the virtual consoles.

218
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,500
Unless you also want to ...
podrabiaæ securities!

Oh, my God also?
It kryminaliœci!
