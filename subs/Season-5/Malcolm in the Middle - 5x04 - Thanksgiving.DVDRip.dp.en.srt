Thanks, Mom.

151
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,600
That was a silly k g of the quarrel, but that of a
symbol of all of the ego in that of the Union.

152
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:32,300
- I mean, there are rules.
- Rules are important.

153
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,000
I know that. So what if
Also I enjoy a couple of beers,

154
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:38,100
I looks as the front of colleagues,
I give the woman a lead?

155
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,400
- What?
- I do not care about the her my feelings.

156
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,600
What!

157
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,400
What?

158
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,300
Of all the grams of stupidity that
You said ever, Francis,

159
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,800
This is the worst.

160
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:54,000
- I was thinking of, you're a mine.
- You do not even have a party!

161
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,800
Now go and apologize to the women's t!

162
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:00,100
You say fail for the EOE mistake,
and she is absolutely without fault!

163
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,100
- Really ...
- The Ides!

164
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:01,800
Approx.

165
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,800
Yes, it's an idiot.

166
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,900
Okay, Dad.
Pull the bird.

167
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,600
- Such an EOE buy the turkey?
- It's perfect.

168
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,200
It is very small y

169
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:24,100
As was to be larger, ...
it would not fit onto the to observe this!

170
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,500
As you insert our dinner at this monster!

171
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,600
This ¯ Monkfish.

172
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,100
Juice of ¯ abnicy after the connecting up of the turkey.

173
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,700
The taste of turkey satisfy fish.

174
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:40,400
Create two are one fantastic dish.

175
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,900
Reese, it's probably not a good idea was.

176
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,900
I do not know, Dad.
Can you're right.

177
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,700
Can I have no idea what I'm talking about.

178
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,400
This should Operate AAE.

179
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,200
S ³ Listen, my beautiful beast.

180
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,100
Yesterday sucks Did you come to trash the ocean floor.

181
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,200
Today, you dance tango with the Gods!

182
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:10,500
Yes, sir.
I'll be for you delicious.

183
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,100
Ok, the situation looks as much better.

184
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:20,200
I'm definitely more or
less certain that the likes me. So thinking.

185
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,800
Looks as it
You're a leaded by the aperture of the figure eight.

186
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:27,700
Jesus, the aperture leaded?
Can not noticed that the a

187
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,100
Malcolm, you give me the chalk?

188
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,100
Le ¿s next aperture unleaded cheese dip.

189
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,800
Ok, ok
I know that I was to a little artificial.

190
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,400
No, I think that in terms of the
the aperture leaded the money.

191
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,400
That's it.

192
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,500
Sorry, hit the am
the aperture to owiowy's the point?

193
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:44,000
Can you think that the a flirt, but
that's not true. This ordinary and wrogoœæ.

194
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:47,300
No, I'm pretty sure also to flirt.

195
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,100
Really?

196
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,200
I do not think I'm in this
as good as the thinking of am.

197
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,500
Before old age.

198
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,800
Son, these truffles are very expensive,

199
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,000
and as the EOE lose the money it's not my problem.

200
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,000
But ...

201
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:14,200
They told me to Buy truffles.
I do not know why, but ...

202
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:20,300
Parents said that the it
Cheap output will be the Feast of Thanksgiving.

203
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,900
My boss is a jerk anyway.

204
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,300
Thank you ... very much.

205

He's right, and sermons of his przeprosiæ am.

But, as will become something of the ego,
This blame you.

210
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:56,300
- Dad, what is it?

00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,000
No, Dewey, it's not funny!

215
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,200
I guess none of you do not understand,

216
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,700
- Are at stake the life!

00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,700
Okay, but it's very important.

218

We create something special.
Something wonderful. Something Beautiful!

219

He will not let me. As to her

Piama, I know also that were
between us various differences.

230
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:10,900
You mean the oziêb e, uncomfortable silence,
interrupted the insults are disguised?

231
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,300
No kissing of me as that.

Here's what I'm trying tell.
