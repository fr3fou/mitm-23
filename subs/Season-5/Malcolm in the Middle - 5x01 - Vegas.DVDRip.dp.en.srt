Neither the ambulance arrival,
or that they should a fire.

212
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:30,600
Neither guy who really choke the,

213
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,100

No one I have not previously he said.

222
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,300
WejdŸ.

223

225
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:41,600
Really he said that the no
you wanted to at the award ceremony?

226
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,500
I advise the wearing of the continuity of the.
But this ...

227
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,200
As much as heartbreaking.

228

Therefore, see the am your performance.
Son bought the tickets, ¿Eby be reconciled.

229
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:54,300
This is not the branch of an olive twig,
but that whole goddamn tree.

230
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,500
As I say, when I
dressed as an astronaut:

231
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:02,400
I believe that the children are our future of.

232
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,700
It is ¿.

233
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:11,800
You can not seriously brothers for not
everything that he says are. This teens.

234
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,000
I'll tell you a secret, Lois.

235
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Even my 14 year old son is ashamed of me.

236
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:28,300
- No!
- I know, it's hard uwierzyæ, right?

237
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,900
But you can not Insert the past are, Lois.

238
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,200
You Insert today's date.

239
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:40,700
Because as of today,
is a special, special gift.

240
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:45,600
That's why I call it:
teraŸniejszoœci are.

241
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,100
- Otto ...
- Are still being here you are, I was thinking of that the EOE went away.

242
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:03,200
Mia the EOE're right.
It was my fault.

243
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,500
From some reason lately
sabotaging all of em.

244
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:12,800
I've been here a year already i ..
the people rely on me.

245
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,800
And I also, at some point they will fail.

246
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:17,800
Do not be ridiculous errors!

247
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:24,200
No one expects perfection from you.

248
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:28,100
If I wanted to perfect it
I employ the robot. Or Swede.

249
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,300
But I will employ the you,
I ¹ m're smart, you ¿ko working,

250
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,700
and when committing niches b the error,
that you fix it.

251
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:42,300
If from time to time committing niches
b jakiœ the ad, it does not bother me.

252
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,600
- Thanks, Otto.
/ - Here we are!

253
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,000
/ - Thanks to God!
- As we have found the yœcie?

254
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,700
- Connect the hose of a fire yœmy!
- What kind of fire?

255
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,300
One of the cows and fled through the gate,
that does not fix the EOE.

256
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,300
I fall over and the one with the torch,
you do not attach the EOE.

257
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:05,300
Which ignite the gasoline and trace
Baku to open your car.

258
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,500
Which is for this to burn.

259
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:13,400
You see, Francis.
And he says the EOE, also all knocisz!

260
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,900
90 000 slot machines
and that none of them fit the.

261
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,200
Already I can never believe in a prophetic dream.

262
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,500
Once again, thank you, Malcolm.
Do not say anything to his father.

263
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,800
How to meet the am Boone,
This foot long ...

264
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:29,900
No, no, no ...

265
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,900
- Hal! What ...
/ - I love you!

266
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,800
It's all here!

267
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,100
- Would you like pulling the free?
- Yes, willingly.

268
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:09,200
- He knew I was!
- Hal, what's happening?

269
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,300
It's destiny, Lois!
He knew I was, also it happens!

270
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,000
Are you not speak of I,
because I knew of, also do not believe it.

271
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,100
Foaming ¿y ³ em our insurance
the force, but he pays the pack of about

272
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,300
- We're rich!
- What will the EOE!

273
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,400
- Congratulations!
- What is it?

274
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:28,400
It's a coupon for a two-night stay
the Breezeway Motel in Carson City.

275
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,400
/ You just send a listen
/ Four-hour presentation

276
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,800
about the wonderful benefits of co-ownership in the summer.

277
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,000
May the one-armed bandits in Carson City?

278
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:46,000
Gordo, you jeœæ karma.
You can not already jeœæ of fat.

279
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,200
Please, Gordo.
At least try it.

280
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,400
Take a bite of my finger.

281
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:56,400
He eats.
I think I like yours the blood.

282
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:06,000
As she passed out, then pull it out
my finger in his mouth.

283
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:13,200
- So 10 hours of silence?
- How I'll wanted to divide and somehow something,

284
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:14,600
I'll give you know the.

285
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,900
The trip was not completely of no
lost. At least ...

286
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,300
That was a disaster.

287
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:25,900
At least a survival mechanism
in my brain started the operation of the AAE.

288
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,200
As early as the beginning zapominaæ,
what's operates about this weekend.
