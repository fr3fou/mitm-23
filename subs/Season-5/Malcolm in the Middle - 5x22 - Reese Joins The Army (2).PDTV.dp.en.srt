Accrue the 50 cents

I know that the punishment booster
financially a library,

but it is very small y
percent of their budget!

40
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:17,100
So if already not playing 20 questions,

41
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,200
I'm going to save human life!

42

48
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,100

Tell ¿my hands, also the love of her em!

50
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:57,000
Piea, four, three, two, one ...

51
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,200
See? You do not need money
shopping, if you're idea halfway.

52
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,300
I would like to have for
you better wieœci, Hal.

scroll to the prison for you.

55
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,100
And my mysterious stranger?

56
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,500
He has been a half-year of life and
wants umrzeæ of bad conscience.

57
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,900
Completely oczyœci me of the charges!
And it is not a product of my imagination!

58
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,100
So more or less
Last May the things.

59
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,900

00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,000
Do not worry, slowly working
going back to the normal senses of words.

63
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,800
S I think that that new hobby
this helps her.

64
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,000
This name is Sam Gandelbums.

65

00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,800
Niedowidzi, so you are still confusing me.

67
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,700
Everything will be all right, Lois.
We find Reese.

68
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:04,000
Look, the break up of the flower.
He goes to court.

69
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:10,100
Return to the right!
To the left! In the back of the face!

70

In the back of the face!
Forward march!

73
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:27,200
Will just make the whole day.
It has no more sense than a worm.

74
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,600
It is enough to restore the mine
faith in the future of the army.

75
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,100
So does the subliminal æwiczenia her.

76
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,100
Are not using the subliminal exercises.

77

It's an honor, Aug. ¿Ant.

82
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,500
And now let's work on the march
toward the fence energized!

and erases all files lying
"Medicines" without leaving traces.

85
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,900
Not until the end of it I understood,

86
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,400
but he said,
Also can u g Insert the corporate upiej

You can zastraszaæ my children
How do you like it, do not care!

89
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,500
But I must tell the truth!

90
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,700
/ I'll kill you

91
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,500
On the litoœæ sake, do something!

92
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,700
Patience. That something
It's called "too much evidence".

93
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,500
At the end of the jurors get bored.

94
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,700
Accusation calls Gordon Walker.

95

But in grams of the EIB heart I knew,
I must also tell the truth.

98
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,600
Here we have a conspiracy.

And after you destroy the last documents

102
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,100
Throw in the end
another racist a joke!

103
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,300
/ I have no more questions.

104
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,800
But I'm not dying.

215
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,500
Let's take a pause
and calm down a bit.

216
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,300
Do you want a glass of water?

232
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,700
No, it is not.

233
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,900
¿But yes!

234
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:45,400

and the mom does not come

240
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,500
Mom!

241
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,200
Mom!
Of course!

242
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:11,400
Suspend the breath until the bruising and the faint.

243
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,100
A long time already that I was not doing the.

247
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,700
You wrong, we are not in prison,
We only barrier.

248
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,600
A is always a way
to get rid of the barrier.

249
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:34,100
Wyrwaæ a pair of boards
from the floor, podpaliæ of bed w ...

250
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,500
Two things you need to memorize:

251
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:40,000
need for diversion
and a guy who has fucked.

252

All right.
It is too small would postawiæ s.

253

You zjeœæ a little sand,
tor jakieœ a half pounds.

254
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,200
What is the purpose of diversion?
We are related the disappearance.

255

Good wieœci.
Dru ¿yna red soon lose.

260

Two branches were s been captured,
The rest przygwoŸdziliœmy here, here and here.

261
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,300
Now we just
Pull out the æ key to their bags.

262
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,000
Test, test ...

263
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,500
Test, test ...

264
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:47,400
The microphone operates, the chair of a comfortable,

Tell us in the with his own with the words
what kind of worker you are.

267
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,900
Little is efficient.

268
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,100
The form of the Supreme.

269
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,100
You can explained by it?

270
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:10,700
If you work in a large
impersonal corporations like this ...

271
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,100
You know those natural
TV programs

272
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:17,600
where the wasp paralysis loves g the caterpillar
and injected into the larvae her?

273
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,600

Feel completely the c Each
mouthful of ¿j eraj the more the larvae from the center.

He sits in the pit of em every day,
I envy the c the g the sienicy,

276
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,800
because at least
j are shown on television.

277
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,500
³ I hate this job.

278
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,000
Disappointing to me the employee.

279
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:42,400
Yet many of the witnesses present
You as the brain przemyœlnego conspiracy.

280
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,600
These dates, however, indicate an
about your participation in it.

281
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,600
Do you have some way
to reject these claims?

282
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:57,600
I did not have. Who remembers the
What does the 25th January 2002.

283
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,200
Or 14 March 2003.

284
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,400
But my son wpad of the something.
Arise, Malcolm!

285
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:08,900
I know it looks as normal, but
my son is the lD card zar mathematical genius.

286
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:11,200
Its head half should be
pi size of the Company doctor.

287
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:15,400
Get discouraged him are an arbitrary date on any
years, and he will tell you what a day of the week.

288
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,200
What does that have to do with t the issues are?

289
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:22,600
Well ¿... I perceive the that the Each

291
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Excuse me, but why
it is to be such an important matter?

292
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:35,800
For 15 years I did not come of
to work on Fridays.

293
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:41,500
Do not show up for work the
on Fridays from 15 years!

294
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,900
It did not make it
the protocol in, right?

295
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:47,900
Do you have any evidence
in support of this twisted warp?

296
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,200
When you have what I knew of
search for a, in the opinion of've realized

297
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,800
Also almost all you need
in my memory box with the tkami.

298
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:58,000
Accusation claims
Also presented the EOE part to members of the management board

Yes, during my
stay in the Land of Bavaria.

301
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:12,500
And when the EOE allegedly hiding the money

00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:41,100
They chose me m³ younger
trainer at the aquarium.

312

Sorry for the slip-up on my end.

314
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,300
But they should tell they were "innocent"

315
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,600
instead of "found not guilty"
to confuse the box.

316
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,600
Lois wygraliœmy case.

317
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,500
Now, everything in our
¿Life will return to its former place.

318
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:11,200
