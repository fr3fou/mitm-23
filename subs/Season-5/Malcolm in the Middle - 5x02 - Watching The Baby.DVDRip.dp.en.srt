Because everything is better
from the current situation.

179
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,400
I have so the partner on the œliczn

"Do you know who is Reese?"

184
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:13,400
And for a while the posi-tion g:
"If someone knows who is Reese?"

185
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,200
And they shrugged their shoulders.

186
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,200
So he said I:
"Jakieœ probably zero."

187

So today is repaired.

"What happened on the face of his?"

192
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,300
/ Someone will say:

193
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:44,100
"This is Reese. Ca half of himself
the girls are Erina Stepanavicha. "

As the brand Pro-Nation
which are not great,

208
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,300
but after the combination with iron-¯ fingers ...

209
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,300
Okay, what was I talking of em?

210
