Tested by the teacher who strikes the
load current of the PERSON PER b of Edna answers.

164
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:21,000
The Milgram prove that the people
Bed are blindly listen to authority,

165
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:24,400
even if it means suffering ...
an innocent stranger.

What are you doing?

167
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:29,400
In our version, the stranger replaced the
a member of a close family.

And failures up current of replaced the

174
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,700
- Hey, it's not ...
- Malcolm, I'm learning.

175

Breathtaking, is not it?

182
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:30,400
None of us knows if that will do the
the next ¿Szeja person just because

183
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,900
Also a white guy in the white coat, asked us.

184
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,500
The only thing we know for sure ...

Because of you, I came out of
the finite jerk!

188
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,900
- Cheated me hello yet!
- I ripped off of you?

189
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:55,200
