Crazy world of Malcolm
5x14 "Malcolm's dating the family"

00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,100
Every other Thursday, we eat supper
at the pizzeria with Luigi.

10
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,300
It was only two nights a month,
where p is not the crying at bedtime.

11
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,500
This already fairly, stop!

12
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,800
We fight for the wins.

13
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:47,600
Is not that great of an?

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,100
Every 14 days magically
turns into a family of szczêœliw.

15
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,200
And here's the reason.

16
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,900
Pizza with Luigi is so good,

17
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:17,100
Also not only brings out the people,
g the hidden Eboko good

18
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,200
but immediately
creates the not completely new.

19
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:31,800
Another great of an experience
culinary, Alfredo.

20
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:37,800
Doctor's orders.

21
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,400
Alfredo, you still have a tip.

22
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,100
Excuse me, what is
"DZO" at the bottom?

23
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,400
This add-on for handling the UGE.

24
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,700
Operating supplement UGE!
What add-on for handling the UGE?

25
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,800
We add 15% for maintain, many
person is trying to cheat the waiters.

26
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,000
We are doing so for years.

27
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,500
Forced into semi-paying tip
without notice!

28
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,100
So long double semi-aciliœmy
tip, do not know about the c.

29
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,000
Here is the information.

30
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:06,500
This little chit.
That you want to give a reason!

31
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,600
Oh, no. Will row as
in a shoe shop, or like in a circus?

32
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,300
I think that bad, as
in store, "all the $ 5."

33
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,600
Car on fire? I think
s I heard the sirens, you better let's go.

34
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:19,700
Umieœciliœcie were no stamp, no one
it does not read and are justified theft!

35
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,300
Where is the manager?!
I want rozmawiaæ the manager!

36
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,900
/ Do not look at me!

37
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,100
Better not show up
here for a while, Manalo.

38
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:35,300
And then I became a half-hour
parking lot, the dissuasive c cars.

39
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,600
My mom is horrible!

40
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:40,700
My mom ... call of a drunk ...

41
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,800
on my birthday ...
¿¿So that I yczyæ money.

42
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,200
Sorry, Stevie.
I should not narzekaæ.

43
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,700
Escape your mom is inexcusable.

44
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,800
But you know what? Real
friends will leave the.

45
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:55,800
Hey, Angela!

46
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,300
Angela Pozefsky.
³ It is very pretty.

47
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,300
I think I have a chance with her.

48
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,800
From some reason
with anyone not dating.

49
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,600
Can be so without the pretty,
It also deters other guests.

50
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,300
I do not mind.

51
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,600
Part, Malcolm.

52
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,300
Part, Angela, well, you also
with the apparatus of em. I've been thinking of em.

53
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,700
Want zaprosiæ me on a date?

54
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,800

55
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,400
Want AEOI the spring dance?

56
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,200
OszczêdŸ the angle of troubles.
Do not you want with me outputs.

57
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:29,000
Because before you go out with me,
My family needs you accept your.

58
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,300
What not to do without making the
œledztwa giant.

59
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:36,400
So odpuœæ now and let
I umrzeæ in loneliness.

60
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,800
Worried about your family ¹ ¹?
I do not mind.

61
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:43,100
Yeah? My family is
extremely burdensome the longer possible,

62
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:46,300
bossy, control and humiliate the whole the whole.

63
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,000
You're talking to a guy with proper.

64
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,700

66
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,600
Sure.
Can you forgive us?

67
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,100
- You do not need an assistant.
- But boy the boy needs a job.

68
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:06,600
And all the other posts are
already doubly occupied.

69
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,500
Please, Francis, for sure
jakieœ find him busy.

70
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,100
- Okay, I'll try.
- Thank you, Francis.

71
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:17,100
I know that I employ too many
employees and that is the problem.

72
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:20,800
But heal.
Come to this for three psychiatrists.

73
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,300
I'm starting zapominaæ,
tastes like pizza with Luigi.

74
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,000
He says the em ¿ebyœ not we the teeth.

00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:41,200
Call of the owner pizzeria

78
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,700
Clothe jacket!

79
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,200
Lois! God pizza
sent from the ear to our prayers!

80
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,000
Hello?

81
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,700
Hi, says Lawrence Cabrusi,
of the owner Luigi.

82
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,600
S ³ ³ I heard what happened at the

83
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,000
For what exactly do you want przeprosiæ?

84
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,100
The way you treated
You are in Zesz were Thursday.

85
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:06,200
There is no excuse,
awful you feel about it.

86
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,200
I'm on it's the will hear a.

87
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:12,400
I wonder why two weeks
Aje were you an apology.

88
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:18,500
Sorry. He was on a trip I
in Europe and did not even unpack the em.

89
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,400
The most important is that the lady
families are a valuable customer

90
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,100
and really want you back.

91
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:28,300
Apologies were exceeded my expectations.

92
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,700
On the refunds as we can liczyæ?

93
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,000
/ What?

94
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,300
/ Add up the am that the flow aciliœmy

95
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,900
Mr. sends the check, or give as the discount œ tablespoon?

96
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:43,300
We can not Daae your refund.
We do not have such funds.

97
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:47,300
If you become a day trip
to Europe, is 5% of the price,

98
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,200
would suffice for the zadoœæuczynienie
This fools the customer!

99
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,000
There is no God pizza.

100
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:56,800
For sure you will never be
jeœæ in a pizzeria with Luigi.

101
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,600
At least we have the brightness.

102
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,300
Ok, that he wanted to EOE.
Do not tell me you also will not warn the am.

103
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,000
It's all right, I'm ...

104
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,100
This is my mom, my dad,
My grandmother, aunt Leila

105
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,800
Synalar Aunt, Uncle Zach,
Nick, Max and Alexandra.

106
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,600
The rest is in the basement.
This is Malcolm.

107
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,100
Welcome, sit, sit.

108
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,700
- So, you want the poœlubiæ my daughter.
- What?

109
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,100
I can not of themselves oprzeæ.

110
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:53,300
I'm sorry that the need for this przechodziæ,
but it is very protecting of the Angel.

111
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,000
We have dowiedzieæ,
What are you boys of Caucasian teenage boy.

112
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:06,000
Well, ... I'm normal.
Walking with the Angel to school y

113
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:11,100
I have good grades, for 3 days
a week I work in the shop have.

114
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,000
I have healthy teeth.

115
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,000
I have all the graft.

116
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:31,500
Religiously I would name the
szczêœliwym agnostic.

117
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,100
I think that the main g filizoficzne question ...

118
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,000
We can is the crap!
He's a genius.

119
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:39,000
It's the smarter najm
in the entire school, and it's definitely.

120
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,200
Really? Genius?
Say something m³ drego.

121
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,300
Inflation writing her cosmology.

122
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,800
This theory g of the axis that the universe
therefore it is a homogeneous,

123
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,400
because just after the Big Bang,

124
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,400
to the short period of rapid
than normal expansion.

125
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:08,800
I hope that the mention of the role of
Scalar fields in the concept of symmetry breaking.

126
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,700
Not bragging, but
I worked on it someday.

127
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,600
Please!

128
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,900
Until the discovery of the Higgs field,
it must be clean speculation.

129
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,300
Yes, dear.
Those women.

130
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,900
It fits me.
You fit?

131

00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:41,800
Wednesday? Yes, definitely.
Okay, part.

154
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,500
- Who was to?
- Angela's dad.

155
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,500
What's going on?

156
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,600
It is not fun?

157
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:07,000
You're right. We do not need
music, ... We chips.

158
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,400
The most important that the time we spend together.

159
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,600
So, let's talk.
Who are the good stories?

160
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,200
- Yesterday my mother and lost his mind.
- Reese!

161
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:24,000
A lot was to the west, I know that the
is like, so ... what's the problem?

162
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,500
Mom, you do not byœ of a,
do not copy Luigi.

163
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,800
Pizzeria Luigi is the core.
It's not the food that matters.

164
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:34,800
What matters is that the sit here together
and we enjoy each other's company!

165
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,600
If you believe that, then why
Did you come to buy Mexican ¿Arcie?

166
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,600
Good! Mexican ¿Arcie
l the lands in œmieciach.

167
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,900
No, I'm not Copernicus.

168
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,400
Isolate the EOE something,
Then what about you kill the?

169
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,600
No, I'm not odowsk Sk ³ ¹-Curie.

170
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,000
It œwietnie.

171
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,000
When we play at home, then
we use the only cartoon characters.

172
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,600
The cartoons that we saw that day.

173
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:11,800
Approx. Do you believe
into force of continuity after me?

174
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,000
No, I'm Cher.

175
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,600
- Upiekliœcie cake?
- The nuts as you like.

176
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,600
Did you come to do it for me?
It's beautiful!

177
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:32,500
It's lovely.
I love to walk perfectly well with the Angel.

178
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,400
Where is Angela?

179
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,700
Gone through the wheel and the cup as the ¿œ hour ago.

180
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,300
Approx.

181
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,200
- Smaller are better, right?
- The large o Thank you.

182
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,100
I do not have a very open the paragraph.

183
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,700
What does Did you come, Mom?

184
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:53,400
Ripped off of us 15% add-on
Operating for over three years UGE!

185
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:57,500
Well follow boycott the c
them, are not you think?

186
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,100
I do not know, I think we all suffer from the over
something that you just what y depends

187
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,500
I do not know about you
rings, Francis.

188
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:06,900
³ Dhabi would you give me support
in a case in which I have the obvious're right!

189
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,800
Can you blame me!
You know what ...

190
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,100
If you're so sure,
why do you want, you ¿ebym of support?

191
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,600
If you're so sure,
why do you want, you ¿ebym of support?

192
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
J We are, sir.

193
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,900
Not stop
to win, Jordan.

194
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:26,100
Again, I have the hair in his ears.

195
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,800
I was thinking of that the already not
Feel the smell.

196
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,200
Mom goes back for two hours.

197
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:37,100
We have plenty of time to eat
and destruction of evidence.

198
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,800
But ... wyjaœnijmy yourself something.

199
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,200
What we do is not all right!

200
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:46,400
It is morally reprehensible for each time
possible way! We should wstydziæ up!

201
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,300
Yes, yes, yes,
hate each other.

202
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,500
Whatever happens,
that we're in this together.

203
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,800
- Where's Malcolm?
- From the inn the family.

204
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,200
So for us.

205
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,800
I do not believe how much zjedliœmy.

206
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,900
I do not believe how well the flavor of o

207
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:09,300
That was a taste of the, son.
Sticky, delicious with the Father

208
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,600
I know that I must zamaskowaæ breath

209
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:15,400
but by eating mints Suggest,
causes gagging.

210
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,800
We all have.

211
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:21,200
Part, all I have supper!

212
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,800
He was am in the Pizza Connection.

213
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,500
Had to am przejechaæ an entire city,
but to the pm you d is used for something of my ego.

214
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,600
I know how difficult it is to deal Luigi
and large to me for your support.

215
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,600
In these klopsikach is cheese.

216
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,500
I have never met the people I
so fascinated

217
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,900
The Copenhagen interpretation of the
quantum mechanics.

218
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,300
I was thinking of that the grandmother hit someone.
Œwietnie bawiliœmy yesterday.

219
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:59,800
I watch the can of em ... Dad burns the ...

220
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,500
- Part Malcolm.

221
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,300
Wanted to pm you zaprosiæ

222
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,100

- Wow! With the pleasure.

223
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,600
- Super! So to Friday?
- To Friday.

224
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,900
It is wonderful,
when she invite ...

225
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:15,800
Angela.

226
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:20,900
I completely forgot! Hell,
I have two dances dating for Spring!

227
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,800
This, as in the old section jakiœ ...
Well, each show.

228
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,600
But this whole quite interesting trades challenge.

229
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,700
Ergil fairly well describe the
attracting strength up cousins.

230
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,900
As long as you do not do the greedy
and became the prince.

231
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,300
Stevie, you me at all you are listening to?

232
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:42,100
Two girls ... 2 families ...

233
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,700
I do not have ... Two lungs!

234
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,500
What does this have to do with ..

235
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,800
People P. .. your fluke ...

236
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,600
Do not ... dziwad be the em!

237
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,500
Just ... choose!

238
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,100
Yes, well.

239
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,200
Ok, it is 19:35 ... 5 minutes
will take you access to Luigi.

240
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:12,500
Minute will order pizza
so they should indicate flow j are at 19:56.

241
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,300
Mom sends the store at 19:50

242
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,300
and destroy the evidence
before its return.

243
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:19,700
Ignition someday the avoided that.
And it is high.

244
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,800
Yeah.
But today the avoided ignition.

245
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,800
Whatever happens, it's a conspiracy
I was very close to you ¿y ³ a

246
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:30,100
- In addition to Malcolm and Jamie.
- They are different. Now go!

247
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,200
Part, honey, what are you doing?
These are the keys?

248
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,800
I'm going to Luigi.

249
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,400
What!
Why would the want you to do?!

250
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,700
I give up.
It takes too long.

251
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:52,000
I'll go, I'll go up to the cashier
and post the pie for the good of the family.

252
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,000
- Over my dead body!
- What?

253
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:59,000
You can not now poddaæ!
I was thinking of, that we are a team of em!

254
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,500
Hal, we were wonderfully
supporting the old, but fairly so.

255
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:05,800
Women, who love the ever
says "fairly it"!

256
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:09,600
A woman who does not love the close-up ¿s
to this place by the hour!

257
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:13,300
We believe in you, Lois!
You have to continue fighting |!

258
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,500
Thank you, you're right, I will not give up!

259
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,000
Malcolm!
WchodŸ! WchodŸ!

260
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,600

Spread over ¿y ³ am back board.

263
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,500
We can odegraæ battle
Lepanto olives and celery.

264
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,400
I can not zostaæ.

265
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,700
On Saturday, you have to connect the letter with the Angel.

266
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:42,000
In the town the Taiwanese acrobats bed.

267
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,600
I do not think I can.

268
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:48,500
So You can store the Connect to us on
films the night and do not take rejection.

269
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,000
I can not.

270
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,900
Why?
What happened on?

271
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:56,900
Breaks up with me ...
and I do not mind.

272
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,900
There we talked for two weeks.

273
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,800
What does Did you come?
No, it's all right.

274
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,600
The breaking up with her?
Just like that?

275
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,000
Yeah, ... is very difficult.

276
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:14,600
My life is now complicated
And we need the space.

277
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,300
But I ¿ebyœmy were friends of me.

278
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:18,700
Friends of the me ...

279
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:23,800
It's not you, it's me. The last few
week was to œwietnych, but ...

280
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,200
Please do not.

281
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:32,100
No, really.
You know what kind we are great?

282
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:36,200
Angela will differ with a lot of spotykaæ
ch better than me the pack ...

283
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:40,200
You treat us condescendingly.
The Ides already.

284
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,700
Will be widywaæ?

285
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,700
We both know that the not the way it operates a

286
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:04,300
This is the only butter le ¿s on
I toœcie as a block.

287
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,900
It is ... so done,
how Jordan is doing.

288
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,200
- Disseminated?
- Yeah!

289
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,100
Francis, it must skoñczyæ.

290
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:16,900
Like me were the flowers, the sermons of it EoE
I send, and the line was to me the very y

291
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,900
But changes to the helpless infant.

292
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,800
If it was not for Jordan yesterday
in the men's room, then you are still sitting there the byœ.

293
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,900
Domyœli of what I'd be zrobiæ.

294
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:31,000
No, not true.
You're right. Release him.

295
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,300
That would be best.

296
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,500
Jordan, we porozmawiaæ.

297
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,700
- It's about ..
- You have to release me.

298
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,200
Well, yeah. I. ..

299
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:46,200
I feel terrible, but you can not me
stop, even though the do well.

300
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,500
Yeah.
I ...

301
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,000
Sorry.
Of course, also like that.

302
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,700
But I wrote a wonderful EOE were the months the list of commands,

303
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,400

It is a pity that the Malcolm is
at the dance, miss it.

310
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:11,200

318
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:30,200
It may look like the friendly Daae on the pizza,

319
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,700

The case does not reflect the Italians,

where most of the decent,
¿you are hard working Americans months.

326
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:54,100
But before the visit of swindlers
with Luigi, here is a little advice:

327
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,600

00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,700
Retirees with fixed income white.

330
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,600
Local teens at the dance.

331
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,500

332
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,900

How can I trust that the zdradziæ
family, especially you, Lois.

335
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,000
- He does not know what you're fighting!
- The traitor!

336
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,300
See how the clogging pizza in place,

337
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,200

342

It turned out that the rupture
with the Angel was to the terrible b edema.

343
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,700
It is sad. Sometimes you do not know
what you have until it's gone.

344
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,200
- Malcolm?
- Hey.

345
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,900
