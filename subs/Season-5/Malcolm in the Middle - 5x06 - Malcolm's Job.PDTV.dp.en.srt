But does it EoE in the night.

11
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,300
But that's not fair!
I do not know, Dewey.

12
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,500
The case seems to me smoked prejudices.

13
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,400
And one more thing.
I do not want to czepialskiego outputs, but ...

14
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,400
Jamie also makes much progress.

Dad, Mom and the wpad on the head of the stupid idea ...

00:02:58,700 --> 00:02:59,200
That's it!

00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,900
You have an entire force for labor,

Kaza am the znaleŸæ the job.

¿... You value hard work.

55
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,800
The money does not grow on the trees.

56
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,100
The sooner you find a job,
the better.

For my first are the outflows Ate

58
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,200
When you have wynurzymy up
the cocoon on with the doubt in yourself,

59
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,700
dates back to the c after the unconditional affirmation,

60
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,900
the beating of our internal critics c ...

61
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,800

I must quickly zadzwoniæ

64
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,000
Do not worry.
It's not about me.

65
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:51,200
It's for one of the dads. You meanwhile,
relax babies or little as you show at the Am.

66
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,000
You know, these children are stressful for this to.

67
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,800
Part of Young man, so they get bored,
That as many as I can feel my hair grow ¹ ³.

68
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
You also should Wait a few years,
zaæ to make the tower with Jamie.

69
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,400
It's probably a large adjustment is easier when you can is more,
than just bekaæ and sit down.

70
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,900
Your child is able to sit down?

71
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:09,900
For how long?

72
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,600

00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,300
¿Is that?

76
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,900
Do it, Jamie.
Come on, buddy, you can!

77
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,500
Do it for Daddy.

78
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,100
Do not place themselves.
Hold on.

79
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,300
Just one more.
Only one.

80
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,500
Come on, baby.

00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,300
Yes! Well done, Jamie.

83
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,600
I think it belongs to me.

Welcome. Are you accessing the

Welcome. Are you accessing the

86
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,100
Poor with you, brother!

00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,500
Dewey? Malcolm and Reese
tormented me the whole young days.

88
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,100
My life is a torment,
and it's not fair!

89
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,500
Dewey, you're talking nonsense.

90
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,300
By the EoE I were to Malcolm and Reese,

91
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,800
but then stood up it EoE journey of em
and orient the em what's going on.

92
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,300
So they can have a good big brother,
and I'm doomed to them.

93
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,400
I'm sorry, you know?
Just ... Already I do not live there.

94
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,500
Ni care!

Got me wynagrodziæ.

So I'll call you

98
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:20,100
No! No solution of the lurk.

You're so handsome.

Do not worry. If it would save families
I'll be carefully set the toilet paper.

00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,400
Hey, Albert!

All right. Take them lift the goods are
to the basement, to where are crushed.

143
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,500
Crushing a box of each, take it

153
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,800
So I'll take the box of each
straight into the container,

154
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,500
and so I will save the time,
Also I can pozamiataæ the magazine

155
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,000
and view the returns of the whole week.

156
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:22,100
It œwietnie. Looks as it
Also you can the first day.

157
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:27,500
So ... the part
"A place where you are crushed" do not you understand?

158
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:33,300
See you lying crush the box of each
off-site for this purpose.

159
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,500
I was thinking of that the've expressed their clear.

160
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:40,100
Why do we need a place for the submission of a box of books,
if you do not skin the box where you solve the books?

161
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,900
But here is the busiest barely 20 minutes,
So can these ¿³ em ... Mom.

162
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,000
Sorry, Albert.

163
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,100
Instruct him.

164
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,900
What? But after all said ¿Did you come, ¿e ..

165
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:51,500
You should to the of doing this,
just as you were told.

166
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,800
Thanks for diverting attention away from me.

167
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,200
Again, I forgot shoes.

168
00:08:59,300 --> 00:08:59,800
This is ridiculous!

169
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,400
Keep the AOE g of stupidly and selfishly.

170
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,300
One minute you're telling me
Also I roll away the œwietn the robot,

171
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,500
and in the next you give me a reprimand!

172
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:06,900
With the break of EOE rule, Malcolm

173
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,700
Come on. It is "a place for crushing a box of books"
is a nonsensical rule.

174
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:10,900
You know that the'm right.

175
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,600
Albert is an employee of the fifth degree TRACY.

176
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,800
He has 20 years internships in the neck.

177
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,800
Sometimes it's more important,
than that which is for the appropriate and what is not.

178
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,100
Who are you?

179
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,700
Discontinue be melodramatic.

180
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,500
Serious No, I Know-.

181
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:27,600
Because his mother, who I know are going to spend the whole of that force
smoothed the submitter c speech about what for the appropriate,

182
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,300
regardless of the cost
and whether it is popular.

183
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:35,200
And now you're standing here called hose extensions at czyjœ
fifth degree and you blindly statue of aural bosses.

184
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,700
Honestly, Malcolm as the EOE wpad the idea was,
Also this work was to be funny?

185
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,700
That's not what I'm talking!

186
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,000
the truth is that the work is heavy ka ¿, ¿and the Osna
and no one likes wykonywaæ.

187
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,600
I have the best Job in the world!

188
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,500
You have a job.

189
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,500
Yes, the "Hygienic packaging of meats."

190
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,200
Whole day just slicing meat.

191
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,000
No pi ¿s and the s.

192
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,300
There's blood everywhere,
all curse the Spanish,

193
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,300
and wage are my twelve bucks an hour!

194
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,100
Twelve bucks an hour?
I get only piea and a half.

195
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,800
In a properly, the supervisor then dropped to 3.75 EOE.

196
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:04,900
And now, better do your homework are.

197
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,800
The half-hour lunch.

198
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,700
I'm so proud of you.

199
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:12,500
We are so open
the contacts with your Child Lock.

200
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:17,000
If my dads were like you, certainly be
the spa is not in carols and I ¿u with so many guys.

201
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,200
See you at the next class.

202
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,600
We can not doczekaæ up.

203
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:27,400
Jamie has popaliæ Kevin Daae.

204
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,800
Diaper Jamie ... kilogram. Yes!

205
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:39,500
Dakota ... Fifteen kilogram. Yes.

206
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,100
Jasmine ... four kilograms?

207
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,300
It si were unclean.

208
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:52,000
I'm sorry also to the disappointed,
when I found out the, also have a daughter.

209
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,800
Reese, the meat is delicious.
Thank you.

210
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,100
Malcolm, you want to have a piece of?

211
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,000
I do not think I would have had the Authorization
for so the decision.

212
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,200
Can that we should zapytaæ
Employee of the fifth degree.

213
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,900
Hey, I'm an employee
the fifth degree.

214
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,800
How to make the the that the meat
is so fragile?

215
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,400
It's interesting precisely the veal.

216
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:10,800
Imagine that the contribution to Jamie you solve in the box each,
where it never sees the light and the solar.

217
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:13,600
Do not let him ruszyæ
so its not harden the muscles.

218
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:17,200
It is practically œlepy
and fed on the same formula ê ³.

219
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:20,000
That's what makes it so tasty.

220
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,500
Hal advises the jar and the Jamie
In class today?

221
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,300
Well, all in all.

222
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,200
As for the kid,
who can not fill with diapers.

223
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:30,400
That's weird.
Why is so much debris?

224
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,200
³ ¹ P or the EOE up!

225
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,100
What are you doing here?

226
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:43,200
Already says the em. Do not stand up already
with Reese and Malcolm.

227
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:46,000
Need a good, big brother
it will be too late!

228
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,700
Just patch me away
from nutritional disorders.

229
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,900
He arrived here the EOE?

230
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,300
Francis, please, I just want
to someone for me was to me were a few minutes.

231
00:11:55,500 --> 00:12:00,700
It's really such a great craving,
for a kid my age?

232
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,600
Calm down, Dad. He's fine.

233
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,900
On Saturday, I'm free.
Then I'll bring it.

234
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,400
You're owed him recognition
by the way.

235
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,600
He arrived at the ranch.

236
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:13,700
When you first try the EOE,
end of EOE in Mexico.

237
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,100
Of course, the desire to exalt the
lady bag on the outside.

238
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:21,300
We do not want the welded and Mrs.
and sweaty and in the heat of the parking lot.

239
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,900
Malcolm, you're not in the schedule today.

240
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,300
I came only to the mother.

241
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,700
It has a pause at the back.

242
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,300
Last night, my mom accused of s and I
the obsession with a reprimand.

243
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,600
So the whole night, meditating em on the entire operation
a lot of things that from the us I heard the.

244
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:39,600
I have nothing wypomnieæ if
her allegations. There's no way ...

245
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,100
You smoke?! After all these
science that will give us Did you come?

246
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:53,200
After I said Did you come to, if we were also burned
We want you to kill of the cancer will do it!

247
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:59,400
After forcing Francis Did you come to are still being drawn into the mouth of the
and after the swan of the lit cigarette! And you smoke?!

248
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,100
You smoke?!

249
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,900
It's not what you think.

250
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:07,400
When I work And burn two cigarettes,
one for the morning break, and one by the south.

251
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,500
No less, no more.

252
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,000
Who are you?!

253
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,700
Stop it to repeat.

254
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,900
He used discarded.

255
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,800
But to this day the only thing ¹ ¹ ¹ c repress the
your father from burning six packs a day

256
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,700

257
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,900
But you do not throw Did you come.

But you do not throw Did you come!

260
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,600
He thoughts that the so.

261
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,400
K ³ You're lying and smoke.

262
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,000
For the sake litoœæ, Malcolm.

263
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:34,500
Lois, in precisely the I reminded myself

Retention for cigarettes ... which are mine.

265
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,700
He knows.
No good.

266
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:43,800
I think I will leave the open the till.

267
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:47,000
All right, Malcolm,

So ask you to aperture UGE.

270
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,400

You're asking me about aperture UGE after

Please.

274
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,100
For my father and me,

He talks to me as a human being.

278
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,300
There may already be weirder.

279
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,900
Thank you, Malcolm

280
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,800

Although this will not
sucking the competition?

289
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,200
Will you take the watch?

290
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,500
Do not be disappointed each
transient period.

This work is in most
Beautiful presentation.

292
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,100
You know what's weird?

293
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:51,800
Always thinking of EOE by Kimo as
¿Pote much important to you,

294
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,100
then something is changing
and it gets awkward.

295
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,700
Oh my God, you are now
my boss?

296
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:57,100
What?

297
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,100
It's so unfair.

298
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:02,100
Year after year,
Why can not I ...?

299
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,600
Nice to widzieæ,
Also someone veil is used to winning the the.

300
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,800
Can you take a day off?
Go get a cup of coffee.

301
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:09,700
All right, boss.

302
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,600
Malcolm.

303
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,000
This is not, as the appearance of the can.

304
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,300
Lois, are you there?

305
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,200
Later this wyjaœniê.

306
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:44,200
I know what it looks as for you,
but I ask you for a little flexibility.

307
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,100
Trust me.

308
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,400
Lois, where is ...

309
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,900
What's going on?

310
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,700
I must again reprimanded Malcolm Daae.

311
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:55,400
Squashes box of any off-site
for this purpose.

312
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,000
Guys from work are œwietni.

313
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,700
I got the nickname already - Dziesiêæ Fingers.

314
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:07,000
Previous her of the owner
it ceased to use.

315
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,800
I'm proud of you, son.

316
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,600
You work.

317
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:13,500
He could feel like I'm the rozmawiaæ with you,
man to man.

318
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,300
You know, to raise ¿hands, spending ..

319
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,700
cheaters ...

320
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,300
After ¿yczysz me some?

321
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:23,700
Sure. How much do you need?

322
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,700
And how many do you have?

323
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:32,000
Can you just tell me
if you need to.

324
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,400
St ... two hundred and ...

325
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,300
and even a hundred.

326
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,800
Wet bills cold water.

327
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,900
Hold the bed are up together.

328
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:48,200
That was a œwietne when this dude with you the light bulb
puœci the circle on the box with smoke through a tube in his throat.

329
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,900
That was a fine of that, right?

330
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,500
How is possible that the're only good
with the entire family?

331
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:56,000
Why did you not of the past for
on Reese or Malcolm?

332
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,200
He could byœ of the skoñczyæ?

333
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,400
Not serious. You're a good brother.

334
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,100
Obtain a fail for that even this
underestimated.

335
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,500
Dewey! Never would I of the
for Reese and Malcolm.

336
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,100
³ I treat them like garbage.

337
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,000
Large with less than they do.

338
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,200
It is no longer possible.

339
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,000
All the time the torments of em.

340
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,900
I Bi of them, the bra I was their thing,
I was close to the toilets.

341
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,600
I saw the EOE t the scar
Reese back?

342
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,000
This is the bayonet.

343
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,900
How fault I've had the bayonet!

344
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
But they can not have the EOE him.

345
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:23,300
Always speak well of you,
the love you so much.

346
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,500
Dewey, let me also let you in
one secret.

347
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:29,200
Sometimes people love the other for no reason.

348
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,800
As Whoopi Goldberg.

349
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:35,600
With braæmi even more twisted.

350
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,400
So you say ...

351
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,800
Only for me was to EoE I were?

352
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,500
All in all this.

353
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,500
Happens to you fine of a bargain.

354
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:46,800
You can interrupt the cycle.

355
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
You can be a good brother for Jamie.

356
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:55,200
You can be the only child in the family,
who cares about m³ younger and takes care of him.

357
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,200
And it kind of just?

358
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,300
Yeah ... you're right.

359
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,500
Trying zaimponowaæ kids?

360
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,700
Good wieœci, Malcolm.

361
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:09,800
The security chief said of me that cameras have shown the
Also do not squeeze the EOE this box of any purpose.

362
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,800
Zu ¿¿are using these too much of the soap in the bathroom.

363
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,600
Anyway, I passed the EOE trial.

364
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,600
Thanks, also risked Did you come to my neck.

365
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,600
What's your problem?

366
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,600
Such, also I have no idea who you are.

367
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:24,100
I was thinking of, I'm also the mother of the rough,
zapalczyw are, and rape the town,

368
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,600
but that they can ¿poprzeæ,
what is the appropriate number.

369
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,100
But you're so not.

370
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,700
³ I will do to you something of my ego,
and you act like it did not have the space.

371
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,800
He will do the EOE something for me,
because it should be and of the zrobiæ.

372
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,500
I create these rules were statues of uszeñstwa,
I'm your mother ¹ ¹.

373
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:37,700
It's not fair.

374
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:41,500
If this aperture Service does not work both ways,
why do you keep the mouth shut?

375
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,100
Why had I not tell the dad?

376
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,400
Do not tell your father.

377
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,300
How do you know?

378
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:49,000
Because you, so you're not Malcolm.

379
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,300
Why are you doing this?

380
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,900
I know it is hard for you.

381
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,100
Grow up.

382
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,500
You hate being
under the tutelage of the mine.

383
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,900
You want me to get you some odpuœci of a

384
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:02,300
I wonder when the end
you see in the adult ego.

385
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,400
It will never happen.

386
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:08,100
It does not work that way.

387
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:11,300
You can wyprowadziæ out of the house,
assumptions to have on our own children.

388
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,400
You can be even
professor of physics at MIT.

389
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,000
Always the bed your mother ¹ ¹.

390
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,400
And so will
któreœ until one of us dies.

391
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,900
You do not want wsadziæ briefly
g halfway between the knees?

392
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:27,000
No. All game.

393
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:31,300
Listen to, you can take the
one for me?

394
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,800
Paliæ Stop, please.

395
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:35,600
Already cast of am.

396
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,100
K ³ You're lying?

397
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:40,200
Of course, also not.

398
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,300
Jamie, in the end they had to become.

399
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:59,200
Do it like a garage æwiczyliœmy u

400
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,500
No chance, no reviews!

401
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:18,600
... All the same.
We should œwiêtowaæ at lunch i ..

402
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,800
Yes! Come on, suckers.

403
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:34,000
Æwiczyliœcie with the children
if that were the glass and, now suffer.

404
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,200
What are you waiting for?

405
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:43,300
I want this g memorize the upawy s smile.
Before a long time you will not see it.

406
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:47,000
Look at me.
