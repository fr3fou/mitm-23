"The construction worker and the professional

160
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,000
Mia of the brzmieæ obraŸliwie.
This is the meaning of this story.

161
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,100
This zamys of poetry.

162
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:49,200
There is nothing poetic
in "*** I ***"!

163
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,600
The parents do not want their children to
reads were "*** I ***. '"

164
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:59,700
The school district
not tolerate "*** I ***"!

165
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,900
Our ancestors did not return her life
San Juan Hill for "*** I ***"!

166
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:14,400
Now, either you throw the story,
or replace the asterisks write all the bad language.

167
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,400
It is after all the silly ¿g.

168
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,800
What is the meaning of these graphing of words?
And we all know what are the terms.

169
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Besides, Mrs. Shaw and he said,
Fail for the suitable.

170

Sometimes you do not know Shaw

171
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,700
Just do it!

00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,600
It's censorship!

173
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,200
Call ... A.C.L. U
(Organization makes the whole civil liberties)

179
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,500
- What is it?
- Nothing. Everything all right.

180
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,700

Such use someone to pomyœleæ about me.

I do not want anything robiæ;
simply I wanted to get some information æ ¹.

188
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:16,500
Do you want information?
There Constitution.

189
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,100
Your teachers as well
could odlaæ on the American flag ...

190
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,400
By the way I defended
such a case, but that's not the point.

191
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,700
If you need to process,
faszyœci to you, wake up to ...

This dude was to hand the bniêty-

Note the students.

202
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,900
As you know, we spend a literary magazine
called "crystal mid ship".

203
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,900
Really? I did not know the am.

Or we will publish the transformation of schools ê
in the bookstore of the adult,

00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:25,400
or liquidate all

00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,900
You're good for nothing!

219
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:15,200
EOE wasted the completely
four days learning the cylinder.

220
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:18,200
It makes me sick
from looking at you.

221
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,800
It is these measures do not help, Otto.

222
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,500
For each time when the punishment,
lose hours of valuable time exercises.

223
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,100
You simply zrelaksowaæ.

224
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:28,300
How can I zrelaksowaæ,
when Gretchen is to me?

225
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,300
Do not learn the relax.

Learn by Sudden attack the problem,
so long will not give you their secrets!

227
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,700

228
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,300
Can you make a break
and oczyœcisz minds?

229

You're the one wey a pause.

230
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,900
I viewed the video

232

Can I move in the burden For more
at the foot of a lion.

233
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,300
Otto, I'm done with it all.

234
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,300
It does not work!

235
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,700
It ¿pretty great philosophy!

236
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,400
This dance!

237
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,700
Stop myœleæ.

00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,700
Feel the music.
Look me in the eye.

240
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:30,700
But I ...

241
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:33,200
But Gretchen ...

242
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,800
Forget about Gretchen.

243
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Forget about the past and failures.

244
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,300
About the future and hopes.
World does not exist.

245
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:45,600
At the moment there is only you ... and I ...

246
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,600

247

249
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:27,600
What Visitors are those,
how are you doing for fun?

250
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,100
I did not know of what I tell.
It does nothing for your entertainment.

251
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,900
Do not tell me that just became EOE there
for 10 minutes with open thistles?

252
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,500
She did not even listens ³ a, Lois.

253

He was a very busy undressing me
myœlach and dressing in my skin.

254
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,500
The cooling down of the boys. Dinner.

255
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,100
How long will it take?

256
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,100
I had to pozwoliæ Billy Hawkins
help yourself with clothes on gymnastics.

257
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:49,200
Wyroœnie when you stop to wish the æ.

258
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,600
Malcolm, where he was to EOE?

259
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,800
Captain ¿second day of school football
I wanted to show this, and decorate the inside of your cabinet.

260
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,100
Ah, yes.
Call the director of your school y

261
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,700
He said that the of the deposit of EOE s lawsuit
so the byœ He could damage the schools ê.

262
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,300
This blatant a lie.

263
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,100
All I want is opublikowaæ
journal number of full curse.

264
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,900
And this is me correcting it feel?

265
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,300
Not even the deposit I s the lawsuit.

266
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:09,700
But we all are so against me,
Also seems to me that also can not wycofaæ.

267
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,400
Did you come says that the directors are, where sometimes you stawiæ frontal and,

268
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,200
regardless of the fact
how the others react.

269
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:17,900
I'm surprised, like everyone else,
are but I think that I will not give up.

270
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,000
What's her first name?

271
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:19,500
Who?

272
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,000
The girl, whose
trying zaimponowaæ.

273
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,200
I hope that is of none.

274
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,800
This is not because of a girl.

275
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,400
The girl wrote and that
sproœne story.

276
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,900
You have to be careful ny, son.

277
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,500
Girl sproœne write the whole story
may be too old for you.

278
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,300
That's not the point.

279
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,400
Ronnie is a lesbian.

280
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:37,100
Can not and that was to the gay,
if you'd once some time wpuœci the shirt.

281
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:40,600
I'm just trying to help,
although it does not deserves.

And thrown into the us being inconvenienced,

with g the upich, unjustified reasons.

285
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,400
I just are money,
Also so you can not.

286
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,000
Son, do not build in the very large forces than y

288
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,900
Please inputs.

289
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:04,600
Wanted to me widzieæ ...

00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,300
What's going on?

291
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,800
Malcolm, the teachers and I
I do not want the one obwiniaæ.

292
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,800
We are looking for solutions.

293
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,800
This is Mr. Mellon.

294
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,600
It's legal adviser of the circle.

295
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,100
Nice to meet you me.

296

but in the control panel are judging that the way it is,
to all of the return to normal.

298
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,300
That's good, because I did not want anybody fighting |.

299
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,800
Of course, also not.

300
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,700
In fact, you podpisaæ
only the letter.

301
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,400
Are you saying there that "accident" never
does not meet the standards than "Crystals of this ship."

302
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,900
The acceptance of it EoE just to check,
how long it can be cut by tugging the æ.

303
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,800
It was to be just a joke,
sorry for that.

304
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,400
Sign it, and everyone will regain
its wheels you interest.

305
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,400
I did not sign it.
This angle of amstw.

306
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,500
All right, Malcolm.

Did not want the wspominaæ am, but by you
each week, I eat the weight of cakes.

308
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,400
No one is me concerned.

309
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,500
I agree.

With the certainty of you are very pretty,
but to me you're not at all attractive.
