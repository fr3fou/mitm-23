So, either we divide it
three, or say nothing.

153
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,800
You mess from unintended aœciwymi people, Reese.

154
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
So ... donieœmy.

155
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:25,100
I will not tell us what to do the,
unless the curtains will add it to the services.

156
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,900
It's so unfair!

157
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,400
All it does is read the comics,

158
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,900
We worked and we weeks.

159
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,900
-What do you want me to do the ¿a, Malcolm?
- Zmuœ him to tell us!

160
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:36,800
Wait a minute, if Reese for the solu-your
experiment should be something for it receive the.

161
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,400
What? No! He does not even know
why it tripped o

162
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,100
I have been working for 20 years,
do not know why the c.

163
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,800
Append Reese to block any services!

164
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,800
I am here Ralph,
already all right. Will be fine.

165
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,900
- What happened on?
- Other œwinki that were for him the silent e

166
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,800
Francis says the EOE in some foreign Zesz week
Also leave it in the yard.

167
00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:00,600
I used to try, but he's so mild the
and s the sweet that the pigs do not get the zjeœæ him.

168
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:03,900
Do not leave it there until
I do not teach him to be more assertive.

169
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,300
But he spends every ¿d are briefly
day to his care.

170
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,600
No one speaks of,
Also raising pigs will be easy.

171
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,100
No one speaks of,
We will also bring up pigs!

172
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:15,800
Listen to Francis. Or reference
Ralph to the farm in the evening,

173
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,500
or will be looking out the will of
at you with an omelette.

174
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:21,800
Come on Ralph.

175
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,400
/ This is the moment of truth.

176
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,200
Your brothers are judging that the no
give them advice, they ¿ck so carefully?

177
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,500
Come on, I know you can do it also.

178
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,700
You have to be just tough.
Will show your the furious of the mine.

179
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Well it ¿?

180
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:57,900
Smell failures book.

181
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,600
Reese Okay, I give up. You will get
its share, just tell me what to do the EOE.

182
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,100
Okay, just sign it.

183
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,800
Reese has a full ny part in this experiment
and fully share our success with it.

184
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,500
Because without the aid does not
the axis gnêlibyœmy success.

185
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,500
Outmaneuvered ... by the wana ba.

186
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,300
- Everything looks good.
- Now tell us, what do the EOE.

187
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,200
I have not the foggiest idea

188
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,800
I do not remember doing the ¿ebym
the anything special.

189
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:37,400
What?

190
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,300
But now, as I will be the wyœmiewa
and been telling the that the I g of stupid,

191
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:44,300
I have proof of your handwritten signature
Also I'm as smart meters are like you.

192
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Justice, it has become ...

193
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,100
Mother of the child is 13 years old.

194
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,400
Profit from each sold chocolate

195
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:01,400
going to buy the book ¿ek and heat small
the NEB meals for the children of such mothers.

196
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,800
I'll get my purse.

197
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,500
- I tell you, I do not remember!
- All right, let him wstaæ.

198
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,500
Reese, this is important.
It's for medicine.

199
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:22,100
This enzyme can help uratowaæ
¿someone's life one day.

200
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,600
Please, try the
recalling what then do the EOE.

201
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,700
I can not, sorry!
I just do not know!

202
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,900
Normally, the island of Crete em up
the room as usual.

203
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,200
- Try ... play back.
- Yes, that's the idea œwietny.

204
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,800
Do everything you do,
when you are alone in the room.

205
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,400
Close your eyes and pretend.

206
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:46,900
Imagine everything
in myœlach and do it later.

207
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:52,000
Me and Stevie is not here.
You're alone in the room, as he was then.

208
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,400
Ok, let's see.

209
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,800
First thing - opuœciliœcie room.

210
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,900
Then I walked up the tubes ...
¿Savor TO SEE how the enzymes.

211
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,900
But after that I get tired of.

212
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:17,100
And later ... I saw something spark of the lying.

213
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,400
And I throw the spark into my box of the lying meadow.

214
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,800
And then ... Oh yes.

215
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:36,300
I took the one of the shirts with Malcolm.
And then ...

216
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:52,900
Oh, my God also?

217
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,100
Then I was up playing the Game Boy Dewey.

218
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:01,700
To ring and your teacher and speaks of a,
Also sold the greatest number EOE chocolate.

219
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,800
And he said that the all
I hate the rówieœnicy.

220
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,000
I'm so proud of Dewey.

221
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,900
You know, it's a good product.
So the really sell themselves.

222
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,700
I can not believe it. Dewey
sales of more than 1,500 bars of chocolate.

223
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,600
In 1500.

224
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,100
Page 12

225
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,800
The bed in the chali for you the exhaust.

226
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,100
Part of that live here
ch the boy sell the eco-cy chocolate?

227
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,000
I'm sorry, were finished in
PREVIOUS later.

228
00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:00,100
Here you are. We want to Buy
so those who save the forests.

229
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:03,500
- You must be so proud of his son.
- I do not know what the Lord says.

230
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,200
Of course, also you know.

231
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:08,900
You said that the ¿ka da plate is
tree planted in burnt part of Yellowstone.

232
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:12,600
I like that the 10% of the profits allocated
to fight with the abortion and euthanasia are.

233
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,300
Wait a minute. He said to me that the 10%
go to organizations supporting the trades abortion.

234
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,800
- I did not know the am, also have the views of the.
- And I did not know the am, you are also the same.

235
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,700
I'm sorry sir. I must
to someone tell how I feel.

236
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,000
You have a great being inconvenienced.

237
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,200
I hope that will be the idea of
about what you will do the EOE, for each time,

238
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,300
When we saw of me,
the venom of the prize lying yours are.

239
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,000
¿Do not get any prizes!

240
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,200
K ³ ³ break EOE all
¿Eby sprzedaæ they are the sweets?

241
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,700
What do you say about the K ³ am amstwie?
That's the worst thing, as the you can take the.

242
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,800
A lie destroys osobowoœæ, Dewey.

243
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:47,000
Destroys the trust that people
Darz themselves are. Do you understand?

244
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,800
- Yes.
- And how they intend to usprawiedliwiæ?

245
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,600
- Francis sermons of me so zrobiæ.
- Should domyœliæ.

246
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:57,700
- Kaza ³ ³ k EOE brother's hack of the odyczach?
- ¯ ebyœ knew of that the so.

247
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:02,300
I'm already fairly your
sabotage everything we do.

248
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,600
Finely you lose the reason, Francis!

249
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,700
/ Who gives a sick brother's advice!

250
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,800
It's all your fault!

251
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,500
I'm just trying to help the kid,
which is the sawed at each step.

252
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:14,700
And I'm fairly your talking about
Also everything we do is g the pole.

253
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,200
Okay, Ralph, be aware of your's image.

254
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:26,500
You're in the s, hard,'re The largest
the pigs in the yard and you are not afraid of anyone.

255
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:32,400
WchodŸ there, wether you jakiœ of books and eat,
like you've never venom of EOE.

256
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,200
And this is it Ralph. WchodŸ œmia of the,
well you're doing. Well ...

257
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,900
OK, enough, Ralph.
Ralph, without biting.

258
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,800
No!
Not at your own risk mother!

259
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,400
It's hideous.

260
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:54,700
No Ralph, not to ... shed.

261
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,300
If I were you I'd start of the
nadawaæ names of the cows.

262
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,400
And then my ear
in the end was to clean.

263
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,300
Then I will update the list of my enemies.

264
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,700
Note that I do the math.

265
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:21,700
I do not understand, do not understand,
I do not understand, do not understand.

266
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,300
G of UPI, the UPI g.

267
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,900
G of UPI, the UPI g.

268
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:34,900
G ³ stupid, hate each other,
hate each other.

269
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,800
Then I worked on the triceps.

270
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,200
Hey, no one likes math.

271
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,100
I'm sorry.

272
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,000
Never mind.

273
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,500
So, what does the EOE later?

274
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,400
Nothing, I started the odbijaæ five of the tablespoon.

275
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,800
- I do not think there will be more ...
- Throw the j ... again.

276
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,000
- What?
- Reese ... throw away.

277
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:29,900
See!

278
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,700
Branch on up!
Branch on up!

279
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,400
The ceiling must be asbestos!
Of course!

280
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,500
- What are you talking about?
- Reese, succeeded in you!

281
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,100
Asbestos is a highly
mutagenic material em!

282
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,100
You can also change the way
cell reproduction. These cells.

283
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:51,400
And by the by here all the time.
We have asbestos in the ceiling!

284
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:55,000
We have asbestos in the ceiling!
We have asbestos in the ceiling!

285
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,500
What?

286
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,500
Will soon be an omelet.

287
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,500
So we live here until
until the asbestos is removed.

288
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,600
I wygraliœmy competition.

289
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,800
It turned out that the company is sponsoring the whole
retains patent rights.

290
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:26,100
Use the Jobs are our production
a new drug, which will earn the billions.

291
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,400
And you know what we dostaliœmy?

292
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,600
Pencil cases.
It even has a built-in compass.

293
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,900
Mom, Dad - no need for the pencil?

294
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,600
No, Reese still
no need for the pencil.

295
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:40,100
When will you know where pytaæ.

296
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:47,000
Ok Francis, how long we'll be
dzieliæ Obtain a box with Ralph? This is ridiculous.

297
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,500
Really showed the courage of the,
but I think there is still confident.

298
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,900
Da know the when will be ready.
