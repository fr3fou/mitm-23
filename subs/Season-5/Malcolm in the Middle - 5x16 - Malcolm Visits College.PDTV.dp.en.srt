73

91
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,000
Entertainment.

92

Otto, one of the parents
does not appear to take over the ¿d ¿ce.

138
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,300
Their children are here.

139
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,000
That's weird.
No one answers phone

140
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,200
So I came of the rooms.
Everywhere is a "Do Not Disturb".

157
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,000
Of course.

158
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,400
Okay kids, this is the layout of the ad.

159
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:07,600
My name is Leland.

160
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,700
And what I'm important in local government will be.

161
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,300
I am the advisor to the inhabitants ¿,
which means that the government's money on the floor.

162
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,400
Then you have œciszyæ music.

163
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,100
You really are so loudly?

164
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:18,600
S ³ Look, dude.

165
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,700
Can I be your best friend,
or worst nightmare.

166
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,600
Now switched on the radio.

167
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,000
It jakiœ problem?

168
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,600
- Who are you?
- His mother ¹.

169
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,300
Supervises the children in the Mixed room.

170
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,200
I do not believe that the university that allows it.

171
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,700
You know what, not why I'm here.

172
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:38,600
This radio is at least
5 decibels too loudly.

173
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,400
I'll be they had to skonfiskowaæ,
or go to worse consequences.

174
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,500
You know, Leland?
He was am in college.

175
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:50,100
I know how are the authorities and the authority you have.

176
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,100
Good night.

177
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,600
Malcolm, your mom is awesome.

178
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,500
I am glad also arrived with her are the EOE.

179
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,700
This is the horn of the car my dad,

180
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,600
and the one with the car we have,

181
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:09,600
and the one with the light bulb you with ice cream.

182
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,000
Dewey.
What are you doing?

183
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,900
The chute up and spoil, the repair j.

184
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:21,600
Good boy the boy.

185
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,700
I talked with the lady Hittelman of our street.

186
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,800
And he said that if the want
that you can swim in ¿the piano.

187
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,500
Thanks, Dad, but I have found the
something else that gladdens me.

188
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,300
Well, well.

189
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,400
I saw the EOE my hair in the votes?

190
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,600
I swear that some
things as if they were coming out of the house.

191
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:40,000
That, or someone up with me teasing.

192
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,100
Dad, it seems to me that
Also know what is going on.

193
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,600
Someone sneaks into the house and steals.

194
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,600
Sure jakiœ punk.

195
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:55,000
No, not punk, son.
Jakiœ good kid who selected the from of a road.

196
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:58,100
Anyway, with the catching them.

197
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,600
/ Then judging a book he said:
/ "Is not my boots."

198
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:08,500
Mom and I will make the AEOI to machine

199
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,900
and wróciæ without holding my hand.

200
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,900
This moment is almost as are the sweet,
as a bar, you do not eat.

201
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,000
Barrier for the goodies.

202
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,100
If I had of 12 years or less,
aka the pop of the'd be.

203
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,900
/ What's going on?

204
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,500
God, do not ...

205
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,000
The machine is out of order.

206
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,300
Forbid my son are the sweets?

207
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,500
Mom, it does not matter.
I go to another floor.

208
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:41,400
Using the machine is a privilege,
rather than a universal right.

209
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,500
If my son wants a candy bar, you will get it.

210
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,300
/ You can not decydowaæ for him.

211
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,500
I can decydowaæ.

212
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,200
I must be at the same time?

213
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:52,500
D Ever since I got the key,
that I think that I government money.

214
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,600
Come here, it's not over yet.

215
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,100
Mom, why do not you dress me diapers?

216
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,500
All in good time, Malcolm.

217
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,700
First, you'll get the candy bar.

218
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,100
My parents ... and the water inlet me to madness.

219
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:14,100
I must zerwaæ with the reality
and run away somewhere.

220
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,600
You know what I mean?

221
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,000
S ³ Look, Christie ...
I must tell something.

222
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,200
The first time you see the I,
This is the smoothed em silly.

223
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,200
But then We have paid close up close ...

224
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,200
and I will like of you.

225
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,200
I can not stand this d for much longer.

226
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,500
What do you mean?

227
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,200
I'm not who you have.

228
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,500
I pretend the fault ever since you've seen the.

229
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,900
It is very difficult is continuously traces zacieraæ
and have the good wymyœlon the story.

230
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,500
I do not want this robiæ already.

231
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,200
I'm tired of force in the amstwie k.

232
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,600
I think I know your secret.

233
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,200
No, I certainly do not know.

234
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,500
But it does not matter
I end of it.

235
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,000
I'm sorry.

236
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,100
S ³ yszeliœcie it?

237
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,300
Yeah, looks as that the is already clean.

238
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,900
So if you want it to Grip the,
then we have poœpieszyæ.

239
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,500
Malcolm wanted to only a candy bar,

240
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,000
but Leland close the the machine.

241
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,600
It can not ujœæ him dry.

242
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,100
From the beginning it does not like the am.

243
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,200
That would never happen at the Barcelona.

244
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,000
Why Americans
are immature?

245
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:23,300
You can also write a sharp letter,
or smoothed osisz the message

246
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,800
after we receive me are?

247
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:28,700
Scott, you'll put the frontal and palantom
and tyrants, such as Leland for the entire e force.

248
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:31,300
The sooner you learn to their pokonaæ, the better.

249
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,600
Nobody's likely to get into
at t the university are not compromised.

250
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,900
And he had to Daae will be the key to us.

251
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,000
How?

252
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,300
I do not know.

253
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,900
But there are many ways
to force people to czegoœ.

254
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,400
It can be found something
load the hose extensions lying in their room.

255
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,500
Dowiedzieæ up dirt jakiœ
from that of EOE girl.

256
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,900
Or you can with full confidence NYM
Insert accused him of something

257
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,400
and czekaæ, until he says something improper.

258
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:53,600
Wait a minute.

259
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,300
You are still you are using this trick on me.

260
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,500
No honey, it's something completely of no other.

261
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,800
Now we bring Malcolm candy bar.

262
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:05,500
I guess I'll cool and popular after graduation.

263
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,000
/ Dewey?

264
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,800
Dad!
Here! Come on!

265
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:16,400
What's going on?

266
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,500
I saw the I, as someone with a bathrobe escapes the mother.

267
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,500
Thanks, son!

268
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,300
/ Everything all right.

269
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,800

/ That dance and jump the the,
/ Sapling as lambs.

271
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,300
/ PREVIOUS later.

272
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,000
Otto I, Francis.
I have movies, wpuœæ me.

273
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:46,300
We have a delicate problem.

274
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:50,100
You know how much I wanted to,
¿Eby everything to the best of children.

275
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,500
I went to the store I bought the cake.

276
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:57,100
But I see these ¿³ A special,
the strong point lemonade

277
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,300
I bought the three cases.

278
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,200
Forte the lemonade?
This is an alcohol.

279
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,400
Yes, Francis, says the I, also we have a problem.

280
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,700
Who lives in a pineapple in the ocean?

281
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,800
I am.
I am.

282
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,100
Not every Insert me in my internal voting.

283
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:17,300
Why can not we live in
your internal Voice?

284
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,200
That's all I'm talking, man.

285
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:23,100
But we should AEOI for the meeting.

286
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,000
Oh, my God also?

287
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:31,300
My parents trusted me,
I otru of them I have the consolation that.

288
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,300
What I'm a monster?

289
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,100
Otto, committing the EOE b than the error,
but everything will be fine.

290
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,200
As soon as the children are here,
that we are safe.

291
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:42,300
/ I'm the invisible robot!
/ Rules concerning me!

292
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:47,300
/ Well,

293
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,500
too early for carol singing, right?

294
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,500
Leland poorly zrozumieliœmy up earlier.

295
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,200
Apparently, this job
for you important.

296
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,900
Who knows, perhaps the more so find.

297
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,600
It was to be a great shame if byœ been fired.

298
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,000
Byœ had to return to the home,
to older siblings,

299
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,200
which collects the entire attention,
on which the you deserve.

300
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,800
You really want to ryzykowaæ
for a candy bar for 75 cents?

301
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,000
Overripe Did you come to me.

302
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,500
Just forget about it,
They also lower the rate,

303
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,500
the larger the thrill
thanks of power.

304
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:22,300
If a candy bar was to be worth one cent,
that I'd be on the accounting ¿moon.

305
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,600
I CYM which control freak.

306
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,800
If the pour me, I'll find another the job,
Where will I kontrolowaæ Such use again.

00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:33,300
Besides, already wrote I

to the admissions office.

310
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,700
You only need to press the æ "senden".

311
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
She strives intersection of these ¿socket and the wall!

312
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,600
We are like bulls in Bartelonie.

313
