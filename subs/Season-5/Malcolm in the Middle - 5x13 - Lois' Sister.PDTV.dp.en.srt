00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:33,800
All right, enough of these games!
I'm in charge! I am a grown-y!

00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,100
- That's why you do not want my kidneys!
- What?

191
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,300
In the morning to ring and your cell and answer the am.

192
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,300
That was your doctor, Susan.
All he said to me.

193
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:19,000
How can I tell Did you come to him,

00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,100
Do not pay attention, is not.

Taking only the innocent
child from the front lines.

Enjoy the
the chat when I'm gone!

203

Why do you always tweak what I say,
so also it sounds like you attacking the up!

204
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,800
Why do you always say "always"?
You know how g of stupidly by this you sound?

205
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:56,900
Do not change the subject! God,
a repeat of the scandal of apple flans made pretty in!

206
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:00,700
Not important for this to wywlekaæ
affair with the apple flans made pretty in!

207
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:06,400
Waliæ it, 15 years in terms of am on
therapy, I'm better than that.

208
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:09,900

while still the GNE Did you come into a game
"Who in the goldfish like more".

213
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:31,100
You're right.
K of the canvas with her are nothing would achieve.

214
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,200
That's why you experience Pie to court

215
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,800
- It will not work, Lois!
- ¯ Are you kidding me?

216
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:41,700
Each psychiatrist after 5 minutes
with her the finds also crazy.

217
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,400
Lois, do not get this poorly.

218
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:47,100
But when we meet, it's the word
"Crazy" takes on new meaning.

219
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:50,700
This is what I zrobiæ, Hal?
Siedzieæ and patrzeæ him die?

00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,100
/ Do not destroy the party

234
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,200
Hello party people!

235

Reese, you idiot, do not believe
Also do you think will escape us also on ...

236
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,900
- Cool Car.

238
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:17,100
- I have to say n the important thing.
- What?

239
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:20,400
Britney and he said to me,
Donny also Frosatt like you.

240
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,400
But I want to tell you,
because he believes that you're a conceited of the.

241
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,500
Not possible!

242
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:29,300
He said as they ¿, ¿that these œliczne shoes
you are wearing are not œliczne.

243
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,900
Only g of upkowate.

244
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,500
Why would the order so tell?

245
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,000
I guess because it is also
two-faced. But it is invalid AD.

246
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:40,500
Important is also a girl
should not be a leader.

247
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:44,500
You powinnaœ be a leader. You're
sincere than she and the prettier.

248
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:48,000
- Me? The leader?

251
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,900
You will not hose the owaæ.

252
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:08,800
Glaucoma are always loyal!
This industry, as the spa will be on the field!

253
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,800
Yes, it ¿d ¿up is cool.
Thinking about anything when I go.

254
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,100
Of course, sometimes it ¿d ¿ê
and not thinking, just leave.

255
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,200
But not important where I'm going,

00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,000
Do you remember how in some foreign Zesz
week, I told you the "part".

261
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,600
I answered Did you come to "look
which tries rozmawiaæ with me? "

262
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,200
Really?

263
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,700
Now you're nicer to me,

264
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,500
Did you come because I understood also we have with each other
more in common than thinking Did you come.

265
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,600
Or Think Did you come to,
Also our differences on intriguing are the sun,

266
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,300

- I think a car.
- Cool.

268
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,100
Sometimes love ê schools are average.

Can we go somewhere,

What!

290
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,200
Susan, we talked about it
by phone four days ago.

291
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,400
Did you come to agree to undergo surgery today!

292
