1
00:00:14,823 --> 00:00:16,085
What'd you do?

2
00:00:16,158 --> 00:00:17,250
What?

3
00:00:17,325 --> 00:00:18,917
Don't give me that.
What'd you do?

4
00:00:18,994 --> 00:00:19,961
Nothing.

5
00:00:20,028 --> 00:00:21,620
Mom, I'm trying to study.

6
00:00:21,696 --> 00:00:23,095
Oh.

7
00:00:23,165 --> 00:00:26,601
I'm sure you don't mind
if I, uh...

8
00:00:26,668 --> 00:00:27,726
took a look in here!

9
00:00:29,271 --> 00:00:30,704
M<i>om, I</i>'<i>m telling you</i>.

10
00:00:30,772 --> 00:00:32,137
We didn't do anything.

11
00:00:32,207 --> 00:00:33,674
Oh, you boys are up
to something.

12
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:35,141
I can smell it.

13
00:00:37,012 --> 00:00:39,071
If you've broken another window,

14
00:00:39,147 --> 00:00:41,411
it is going to come out of your--

15
00:00:42,817 --> 00:00:43,784
Are you done?

16
00:00:43,852 --> 00:00:45,114
You want to frisk me?

17
00:00:45,187 --> 00:00:48,714
You just consider yourselves lucky...

18
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:50,621
this time.

19
00:01:06,908 --> 00:01:08,569
That was close.

20
00:01:08,643 --> 00:01:12,170
Either she's losing her touch,
or we're getting better.

21
00:01:15,884 --> 00:01:18,682
<i>??I don</i>'<i>t know??</i>

22
00:01:18,753 --> 00:01:21,881
<i>?? Can you repeat the question???</i>

23
00:01:21,957 --> 00:01:23,652

<i>??Life is unfair????</i>

30
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:44,407
The good thing about being smart...

31
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,004
is I never have to look up
any phone numbers.

32
00:01:47,082 --> 00:01:49,448
The bad thing is
no one else in the family...

33
00:01:49,517 --> 00:01:51,417
ever bothers to remember anything.

34
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:53,511
Hey, Francis,
you told me to remind you...

35
00:01:53,588 --> 00:01:55,453
about Mom and Dad's anniversary.

36
00:01:55,523 --> 00:01:57,423
Ah, great. When is it?

37
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:58,254
Today.

38
00:01:58,326 --> 00:02:00,521
Dude, you're supposed to
remind me before...

39
00:02:00,595 --> 00:02:02,290
so that I can get them something.

40
00:02:02,364 --> 00:02:04,832
That's okay.
We'll put your name on their gift.

41
00:02:04,899 --> 00:02:06,867
Cool. Thanks. I owe you one.

42
00:02:06,935 --> 00:02:08,368
No. You owe me 20.

43
00:02:08,436 --> 00:02:10,301
That's what your share comes to.

44
00:02:10,372 --> 00:02:11,805
You got them an $80 gift?

45
00:02:11,873 --> 00:02:12,805
Uh...

46
00:02:12,874 --> 00:02:14,774
yeah.

47
00:02:23,218 --> 00:02:24,276
Oh, Craig.

48
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:25,478
Happy anniversary.

49
00:02:25,553 --> 00:02:28,420
1 6 wonderful years to the same man.

50
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:30,788
That Hal is one lucky hombre.

51
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:32,019
You shouldn't have.

52
00:02:32,093 --> 00:02:33,025
Oh, please.

53
00:02:33,094 --> 00:02:35,790
A special gift for a special lady...

54
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:37,331
on a special day.

55
00:02:37,399 --> 00:02:39,299
No. I mean, really,
you shouldn't have.

56
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:41,460
Aren't only husbands
supposed to give gifts?

57
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,834
Fine.
Throw it in the trash, then.

58
00:02:43,905 --> 00:02:44,929
Ho-ho-hold on.

59
00:02:45,006 --> 00:02:47,031
Let's see what it is first.

60
00:02:47,108 --> 00:02:48,302
Oh, look at...

61
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:51,038
- I've been meaning to try this color.
- I know.

62
00:02:51,112 --> 00:02:52,909
I saw you eyeing it
a couple weeks ago.

63
00:02:52,981 --> 00:02:54,573
I didn't know
we carried this brand.

64
00:02:54,649 --> 00:02:55,581
We don't.

65
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:57,242
So where did you see me...?

66
00:02:57,319 --> 00:02:58,411
So, big plans for tonight?

67
00:02:58,486 --> 00:03:01,046
What are you going
to be wearing?

68
00:03:01,122 --> 00:03:03,716
Oh, it's going to be great.
I have the most perfect red dress.

69
00:03:03,792 --> 00:03:05,350
Took me two months
to save up for it,

70
00:03:05,427 --> 00:03:06,758
but it was worth it.

71
00:03:06,828 --> 00:03:10,992
Oh, I've been fantasizing
about this night forever.

72
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:25,910
[ Sighing ]

73
00:03:47,402 --> 00:03:48,630
<i>Craig?</i>

74
00:03:48,703 --> 00:03:50,864
Huh? Yeah, uh, say, Lois,

75
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:51,997
you, uh,

76
00:03:52,073 --> 00:03:54,303
you want to catch a movie
or something over lunch?

77
00:03:54,376 --> 00:03:57,311
They're playing M<i>y Best Friend</i>'<i>s Wedding</i>
over in Electronics.

78
00:03:57,379 --> 00:03:59,506
- No, thanks. I--
- Fine. Forget it.

79
00:03:59,581 --> 00:04:01,742
Oof!.

80
00:04:01,816 --> 00:04:03,044
[ Groaning ]

81
00:04:03,118 --> 00:04:04,176
I'm okay.

82
00:04:06,054 --> 00:04:08,614
Are you boys almost finished
wrapping our present?

83
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:10,123
I have to meet your father...

84
00:04:10,191 --> 00:04:12,091
at the restaurant in ten minutes.

85
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,991
More paper.

86
00:04:14,062 --> 00:04:15,620
I get to do the bow.

87
00:04:15,697 --> 00:04:17,995
Why'd she give you
the money to buy the gift?

88
00:04:18,066 --> 00:04:20,296
Because she didn't want
another karate video.

89
00:04:20,368 --> 00:04:21,300
It's ka-ra-te.

90
00:04:21,369 --> 00:04:22,802
I get to do the bow.

91
00:04:22,871 --> 00:04:24,099
What did we get them anyway?

92
00:04:24,172 --> 00:04:25,104
Picture frame.

93
00:04:25,173 --> 00:04:26,105
Brownnoser.

94
00:04:26,174 --> 00:04:27,801
I get to do the bow.

95
00:04:27,876 --> 00:04:29,138
We're not finished yet.

96
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:31,405
Yeah, but I get to do the bow.

97
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:56,098
Finished.

98
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:58,105
Finally.

99
00:04:58,173 --> 00:05:01,006
No! I was supposed
to do the bow.

100
00:05:01,075 --> 00:05:02,303
You should have said something.

101
00:05:02,377 --> 00:05:03,309
I'm telling.

102
00:05:03,378 --> 00:05:05,869
Mom!

103
00:05:05,947 --> 00:05:07,881
No!

104
00:05:07,949 --> 00:05:10,042
Fire?

105
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:12,284
Fire?

106
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:14,378
Fire?!

107
00:05:14,456 --> 00:05:15,388
Mom! What...?

108
00:05:15,457 --> 00:05:19,416
This is the most stupid, irresponsible,
dangerous thing you have ever <i>done</i>.

109
00:05:19,494 --> 00:05:21,689
<i>Is this what you want?</i>

110
00:05:21,763 --> 00:05:23,890
Will we have to identify
your charred little bodies...

111
00:05:23,965 --> 00:05:26,297
through their dental records?

112
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:28,198
I want a straight answer.

113
00:05:28,269 --> 00:05:29,258
Who did this?

114
00:05:29,337 --> 00:05:30,269
Malcolm did it.

115
00:05:30,338 --> 00:05:31,270
Reese did it.

116
00:05:31,339 --> 00:05:33,273
- I didn't do it!
- I didn't do it!

117
00:05:33,341 --> 00:05:36,174
We're going to the dentist?

118
00:05:37,412 --> 00:05:38,970
Who?

119
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,483
I don't like that one anyway.

120
00:05:46,921 --> 00:05:48,650
No. No. Not that one.

121

Who?

125
00:05:57,565 --> 00:05:58,896
It wasn't me. It was him.

126
00:05:58,967 --> 00:06:00,059
No, it was--

127
00:06:00,134 --> 00:06:01,726
Okay. Into the hallway.

128
00:06:01,803 --> 00:06:03,293
Think I'm going to puke.

129
00:06:03,371 --> 00:06:05,862
Yeah? Well, it's going to be
the highlight of your evening,

130
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:09,137
because nobody is going anywhere
until one of you tells me who.

131
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:10,142
Everything's all set up?

132
00:06:10,211 --> 00:06:11,508
I believe so, sir.

133
00:06:13,715 --> 00:06:15,205
Table seven? Chateau Brut '8<i>7</i>?

134
00:06:15,283 --> 00:06:16,511
Hors d'oeuvres medley?

135
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:18,211
Yes, sir.

136
00:06:19,354 --> 00:06:22,118
Oh, geez, one more thing.

137
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:23,214
I almost forgot.

138
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:24,690
Uh, my wife always orders lobster,

139
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,590
so could you have
the chef slip this...

140
00:06:26,661 --> 00:06:29,152
on the lobster's claw
just before you serve it?

141
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:32,290
She gets such a kick
out of stuff like that.

142
00:06:32,367 --> 00:06:34,301
And so do I, for that matter.

143
00:06:34,369 --> 00:06:35,996
Not a problem, sir.

144
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:39,633
The violinist has our song?

145
00:06:39,707 --> 00:06:41,766
He received the sheet music
this morning.

146
00:06:41,843 --> 00:06:44,607
Good.
Good, good, good, good.

147
00:06:44,679 --> 00:06:46,613
You would be surprised
how many times I've heard...

148
00:06:46,681 --> 00:06:49,548
''Tears of a Clown''
just butchered.

149
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:50,549
Tell her.

150
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:52,108
You tell her.

151
00:06:52,186 --> 00:06:53,118
Who?

152
00:06:53,187 --> 00:06:54,677
- Malcolm!
- Reese!

153
00:06:54,756 --> 00:06:56,280
Closer to the wall.

154
00:06:56,357 --> 00:06:58,348
Wait, Mom. Seriously.

155
00:06:58,426 --> 00:07:00,257
It reeks over here.

156
00:07:00,328 --> 00:07:01,556
I can't help it.

157
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:04,598
Into the TV room. Let's go.

158
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:08,898

I'll give you five dollars
if you tell Mom you did it.

163
00:07:20,515 --> 00:07:21,482
You tell her.

164
00:07:21,549 --> 00:07:23,176
You did it,
'cause I didn't do it.

165
00:07:23,251 --> 00:07:24,183
I really didn't.

166
00:07:24,252 --> 00:07:26,243
- What are you eating?
