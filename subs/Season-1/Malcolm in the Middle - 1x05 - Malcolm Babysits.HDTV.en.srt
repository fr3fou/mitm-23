00:06:12,886 --> 00:06:14,683
I didn't want to say this before

169
00:06:14,755 --> 00:06:16,222
but you've confirmed it--

170
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:19,157
Marlin Academy is the most
boring place on earth.

171
00:06:19,226 --> 00:06:21,956
We're not going to find
anything interesting.

172
00:06:26,433 --> 00:06:28,401
I take that back.

173
00:06:28,468 --> 00:06:29,696
Look, the circus!

174
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:31,897
The circus is at our house!

175
00:06:33,674 --> 00:06:36,939
Say good-bye for a few days, boys.
We're moving out.

176
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:38,272
This is humiliating.

177
00:06:38,345 --> 00:06:40,745
Why can't we just stay
at a nice hotel?

178
00:06:40,814 --> 00:06:42,247
Because we're giving
all our money

179
00:06:42,316 --> 00:06:43,715
to the exterminators

180
00:06:43,784 --> 00:06:45,649
so <i>they</i> can stay in nice hotels.

Craig...

182
00:06:48,755 --> 00:06:50,985
thank you <i>so much</i>
for lending us your trailer.

183
00:06:51,058 --> 00:06:52,582
Oh, I'm just glad
someone's finally

184
00:06:52,659 --> 00:06:53,853
getting some use out of it.

185
00:06:53,927 --> 00:06:56,054
I bought it 1 5 years ago
to take on my honeymoon.

186
00:06:56,129 --> 00:06:56,959
You were married?

187
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:58,497
No, I live on hope.

188
00:06:58,565 --> 00:07:00,192
Well...

189
00:07:00,267 --> 00:07:01,131
thanks again.

190
00:07:01,201 --> 00:07:03,396
You're welcome.

191

Bye.

192
00:07:11,044 --> 00:07:12,978
Good-bye.

193

Aw, this is cozy!

194

It's 1 50 degrees in here!

195

My butt is sweating.

196

Ah, it just needs
to air out a little.

197
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:33,327
The trailer!

198
00:07:34,501 --> 00:07:35,991
Come on, let's make
the best of this.

199
00:07:36,069 --> 00:07:37,900
I'm going to go baby-sit.

200
00:07:37,971 --> 00:07:38,995
It's still early.

201
00:07:39,072 --> 00:07:39,902
They don't mind.

202
00:07:39,973 --> 00:07:41,531
They paying you okay?

203
00:07:41,608 --> 00:07:42,575
Yeah.

204
00:07:42,642 --> 00:07:44,075
It's okay.

205
00:07:45,545 --> 00:07:48,309
I can't believe how much
these people are paying me!

206
00:07:48,382 --> 00:07:49,610
I did the math...

207
00:07:49,683 --> 00:07:52,550
I'm actually making more an hour
than Mom does.

208
00:07:52,619 --> 00:07:54,484
( <i>sighing contentedly</i> )

209
00:07:56,089 --> 00:07:57,454
I got to stop doing this.

210
00:07:57,524 --> 00:07:59,458
It's creepy, right?

211
00:08:00,794 --> 00:08:03,194
''Lester.''

212
00:08:03,263 --> 00:08:05,322
Looks like he was the janitor.

213
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:08,425
How long you think
he's been down here?

214
00:08:11,171 --> 00:08:13,264
I'd say May of'85.

215
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:15,331
You can tell that by tasting?

216
00:08:15,409 --> 00:08:17,434
No, the date on the newspaper.

217
00:08:17,511 --> 00:08:18,842
Then why did you lick him?

218
00:08:18,912 --> 00:08:21,574
How often do you get
to taste a mummy?

219
00:08:23,016 --> 00:08:24,449
We should tell
someone about him.

220
00:08:24,518 --> 00:08:25,815
Uh, no, you can't do that.

221
00:08:25,886 --> 00:08:27,751
Commandant will know
you took the key

222
00:08:27,821 --> 00:08:28,810
and he'll punish you

223
00:08:28,889 --> 00:08:30,083
and then he'll punish me

224
00:08:30,157 --> 00:08:31,988
and I'm going to have
to punish you.

225
00:08:32,058 --> 00:08:34,253
Yeah, but don't you think
that's kind of sad?

226
00:08:34,327 --> 00:08:37,558
I mean, Lester's family will
never know what happened to him.

227
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:39,895
They probably still set a place
for him on holidays.

228
00:08:39,966 --> 00:08:43,299
Yeah, well,judging by
the empty scotch bottles

I don't think so.

230
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,307
Damn. Beta.

231
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:57,914
And you made fun of me

232
00:08:57,984 --> 00:09:00,111
when I bought
this mesh underwear.

233
00:09:00,187 --> 00:09:02,815
Who looks like an idiot now?

234
00:09:02,889 --> 00:09:05,084
I stand corrected.

235
00:09:05,158 --> 00:09:06,887
Close the door.
Were you raised

236
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,892
in a barn?

237
00:09:07,961 --> 00:09:09,360
But it's cooler outside.

238
00:09:09,429 --> 00:09:10,361
Are you sure?

239
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:11,556
Yeah.

240
00:09:30,183 --> 00:09:32,447
Will you please

241
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:33,577
make up your mind?

242
00:09:33,653 --> 00:09:35,848
There's no need
for that kind of tone.

243
00:09:35,922 --> 00:09:37,184
It wasn't a tone.

244
00:09:37,257 --> 00:09:38,656
There it is again.

245
00:09:38,725 --> 00:09:40,249
Look, Hal, it's hot.

246
00:09:40,327 --> 00:09:41,624
We're all cranky.

247
00:09:41,695 --> 00:09:43,993
Will you please just drop it?

248
00:09:44,064 --> 00:09:44,587
Fine.

249
00:09:47,067 --> 00:09:48,534
I think you should apologize.

250
00:09:48,602 --> 00:09:50,069
I didn't hear you apologize to me

251
00:09:50,136 --> 00:09:52,661
when you used up all the liquid
in the chemical toilet.

252

Well, we have
your taco casserole

to thank for that, don't we?

254
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:59,104
Boys, will you step
outside for second?

255
00:09:59,179 --> 00:10:01,909
Your father and I need
a little privacy.

256

Lois: Look, I didn't want to say
anything in front of the boys

like a giant ass!

Oh, really?

259

Well, as long as we're

to see something?

That's okay;
I don't want to break it.

Ah, don't be silly.

264
00:10:21,701 --> 00:10:22,725
Come, take a look.

265
00:10:25,872 --> 00:10:27,863
Wow.

They're rich, they're smart,
they're polite...

What are they going to do next,
give me a million dollars?

270

Malcolm, do you want
a million dollars?

What?!

a sandwich to take home?

Oh. Close enough.

274

because you said
you weren't interested!

the whole time!

00:13:33,226 --> 00:13:34,193
been answered.

333
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:35,192
Right.

334
00:13:35,261 --> 00:13:36,990
This is good.

335
00:13:37,063 --> 00:13:39,258
At least someone else
in the family is normal.

336
00:13:39,332 --> 00:13:40,856
Hey, listen, while I got you...

337
00:13:40,934 --> 00:13:43,095
you're in school
with all those science brains.

338
00:13:43,169 --> 00:13:44,796
How would you reattach a head

339
00:13:44,871 --> 00:13:46,133
to a dead body?

340
00:13:53,113 --> 00:13:54,273
( <i>paper rustling</i> )

341
00:13:54,347 --> 00:13:55,439
Keep it down!

342
00:13:55,515 --> 00:13:56,482
Huh?

343
00:13:56,549 --> 00:13:57,914
Don't talk to her like that.

344
00:13:57,984 --> 00:13:59,315
Would you go sit in the corner?

345
00:13:59,385 --> 00:14:01,876
There are no corners!

346
00:14:03,022 --> 00:14:04,751
You ready to make up?

347
00:14:06,126 --> 00:14:07,889
No.

348
00:14:07,961 --> 00:14:10,225
Me, neither.

349
00:14:13,533 --> 00:14:14,761
Oh, hello, son.

350
00:14:14,834 --> 00:14:16,859
I barely see you anymore.

351
00:14:16,936 --> 00:14:19,928
That baby-sitting has turned
into a full-time job.

352
00:14:20,006 --> 00:14:22,440
Well, sometimes I just
go over there to hang out

353
00:14:22,509 --> 00:14:24,340
and watch TV...

354
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:26,571
live in a house...

355
00:14:28,148 --> 00:14:30,548
Dad, does this seem okay to you?

356
00:14:30,617 --> 00:14:33,017
Gosh, no. Your mother and I
have never fought

357
00:14:33,086 --> 00:14:34,280
for this long before.

358
00:14:34,354 --> 00:14:36,914
It's been days,
and we still haven't made up.

359
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:38,617
I don't even know
what the problem is.

360
00:14:38,691 --> 00:14:41,626
Something's missing.

361
00:14:41,694 --> 00:14:43,594
Boy...

362
00:14:43,663 --> 00:14:45,563
look at that sky, Malcolm.

363
00:14:45,632 --> 00:14:47,862
Just think

364
00:14:47,934 --> 00:14:53,497
somewhere out there
in all those stars and planets

365
00:14:53,573 --> 00:14:56,804
there might be at this very moment

366
00:14:56,876 --> 00:14:59,572
a space dad who just got kicked out

367
00:14:59,646 --> 00:15:01,307
of his space trailer

368
00:15:01,381 --> 00:15:03,144
who is looking down at us.

369
00:15:03,216 --> 00:15:06,151
Or would it be up at us?

370
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:09,247
Or maybe sideways?

371
00:15:09,322 --> 00:15:10,220
Trust me, Dad.

372
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:13,088
They're all looking <i>down</i> on us.

373
00:15:14,694 --> 00:15:15,888
The matinee gets out at 4:00

374
00:15:15,962 --> 00:15:17,452
so we should be back
before dinner.

375
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:18,554
Okay.

376
00:15:18,631 --> 00:15:19,757
What do you want me

377
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:21,164
to feed the kids for lunch?

378
00:15:21,234 --> 00:15:22,895
Whatever you want.
We trust you.

379
00:15:22,969 --> 00:15:25,028
They trust me.

380
00:15:25,104 --> 00:15:26,833
People like this trust me.

381
00:15:26,906 --> 00:15:29,500
I obviously have to say
something nice back to them.

382
00:15:29,576 --> 00:15:31,009
This is why my family sucks.

383
00:15:31,077 --> 00:15:32,442
I have no training in this.

384
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:34,804
This job...

385
00:15:36,182 --> 00:15:38,514
me... like.

386
00:15:39,886 --> 00:15:41,615
We're thrilled
to have found you, Malcolm.

387
00:15:41,688 --> 00:15:42,677
The kids love you.

388
00:15:42,755 --> 00:15:44,188
You're great to have around.

389
00:15:44,257 --> 00:15:46,282
You've really become
one of the family.

390
00:15:51,531 --> 00:15:53,431
I may not have been
switched at birth

391
00:15:53,499 --> 00:15:54,727
but I should have been.

392
00:15:54,801 --> 00:15:56,393
I <i>love</i> these people.

393
00:15:58,671 --> 00:16:00,332
( <i>speaking Chinese</i> )

394
00:16:46,853 --> 00:16:48,150
Okay, come on.

395
00:16:52,091 --> 00:16:53,353
Wait a minute.

396
00:16:57,363 --> 00:16:58,352
Sorry.

397
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:01,289
Well...

398
00:17:01,367 --> 00:17:05,167
let's see what our little
friend did today.

399
00:17:08,374 --> 00:17:10,865
( <i>whistling</i> )

400
00:17:45,345 --> 00:17:46,778
Oh, hi.

401
00:17:46,846 --> 00:17:47,972
Don't worry.

402
00:17:48,047 --> 00:17:49,309
I'd never hurt Barney.

403
00:17:49,382 --> 00:17:50,815
He's part of the family.

404
00:17:50,883 --> 00:17:52,783
Just like <i>I</i>'<i>m</i> part
of the family, right?

405
00:17:52,852 --> 00:17:54,444
And since a big part
of this family

406
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,817
is being such a huge phony

407
00:17:55,888 --> 00:17:57,446
and launching
secret investigations

408
00:17:57,523 --> 00:17:58,581
against each other

409
00:17:58,658 --> 00:17:59,784
I thought I'd join in.

410
00:17:59,859 --> 00:18:02,089
Personal computers are great.

411
00:18:02,161 --> 00:18:05,289
You can file tax returns,
medical records

412
00:18:05,365 --> 00:18:06,798
embarrassing private E-mail...

413
00:18:06,866 --> 00:18:08,800
A little security tip, though.

414
00:18:08,868 --> 00:18:10,460
Never use your birthdate

415
00:18:10,536 --> 00:18:12,697
as your password.

416
00:18:12,772 --> 00:18:14,603
And hiding things
in a fake salt can?

417
00:18:14,674 --> 00:18:16,938
That's just silly.

418
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:18,409
I don't know who Melissa is

419
00:18:18,478 --> 00:18:20,378
but she sure wears
a lot of lipstick.

420
00:18:20,446 --> 00:18:22,812
Anyway, I think I hear you guys

421
00:18:22,882 --> 00:18:24,247
pulling up in the driveway

422
00:18:24,317 --> 00:18:25,682
so let's just leave it at this:

423
00:18:25,752 --> 00:18:26,810
I quit.

424
00:18:26,886 --> 00:18:28,547
Bye.

425
00:18:32,158 --> 00:18:33,455
Who's Melissa?

426
00:18:36,629 --> 00:18:39,154
( <i>arguing in trailer</i> )

427
00:18:39,232 --> 00:18:41,325
Hi, son.
Didn't hear you drive up.

428
00:18:41,401 --> 00:18:43,130
I decided to walk.

429
00:18:43,202 --> 00:18:45,397
So, how's the job going?

430
00:18:45,471 --> 00:18:47,063
They were jerks, so I quit.

431
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:49,506
Well, that's pretty much
what work is.

432
00:18:49,575 --> 00:18:50,803
Welcome to the club.

433
00:18:51,811 --> 00:18:52,971
Dad?

434
00:18:53,046 --> 00:18:54,104
Hmm?

435
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:55,340
I'm really sorry.

436
00:18:55,415 --> 00:18:57,349
What? About quitting?

437
00:18:57,417 --> 00:18:58,543
Nah...

438
00:18:58,618 --> 00:19:00,813
no big deal,
especially for you.

439
00:19:00,887 --> 00:19:02,149
Malcolm, you should
set your sights

440
00:19:02,221 --> 00:19:03,415
as high as you can.

441
00:19:03,489 --> 00:19:05,855
If anyone in this family
has a shot at greatness

442
00:19:05,925 --> 00:19:06,983
it's you.

443
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:09,358
Just, uh... do me a favor, huh?

444
00:19:09,429 --> 00:19:10,760
Look after your brothers?

445
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:12,092
Okay, wait, wait.

446
00:19:12,165 --> 00:19:14,326
You mean everything
you just said, right?

447
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,595
Why would I say something
I didn't mean?

448
00:19:16,669 --> 00:19:18,637
See? That's what
I'm talking about.

449
00:19:18,704 --> 00:19:21,195
This family may be
rude, loud and gross

450
00:19:21,274 --> 00:19:23,299
and have no shame whatsoever...

451
00:19:23,376 --> 00:19:25,207
Anyway, with them

452
00:19:25,278 --> 00:19:27,838
you know where you stand

453
00:19:27,914 --> 00:19:30,041
and when I have a problem,
they're always there.

454
00:19:30,116 --> 00:19:31,242
Oh, my Lord.

455
00:19:31,317 --> 00:19:33,012
- ( <i>dish crashing</i> )
- Sex!

456
00:19:36,589 --> 00:19:38,614
( <i>car pulls away quickly</i> )

457
00:19:38,691 --> 00:19:40,852
Things didn't work out so bad.

458
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:44,158
I made enough money
to get my robotics kit.

459
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:46,892
Or maybe I should do
something nice for my family.

460
00:19:46,966 --> 00:19:48,297
Take them to dinner...

461
00:19:48,367 --> 00:19:49,834
treat them to a movie...

462
00:19:51,637 --> 00:19:53,571
Naw, then I couldn't do this.

463
00:19:53,639 --> 00:19:55,004
Lois:
If you don't change your underwear

464
00:19:55,074 --> 00:19:56,234
this is exactly what happens.

465
00:19:56,309 --> 00:19:59,073
Like the ancient
civilizations before us

466
00:19:59,145 --> 00:20:01,773
we send off this noble man
with the riches he had in life

467
00:20:01,848 --> 00:20:04,976
so he may enjoy them
in the afterlife.

468
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:13,353
Farewell, noble Lester.

469
00:20:17,163 --> 00:20:19,256
It's burning really fast.

470
00:20:20,366 --> 00:20:21,993
How much gas did you use?

471
00:20:22,068 --> 00:20:23,092
Half a can.

472
00:20:25,805 --> 00:20:27,534
Where'd you put the can?

473
00:20:27,607 --> 00:20:29,438
( <i>explosion</i> )

474
00:20:29,509 --> 00:20:31,534
Oh...

475
00:20:31,611 --> 00:20:32,600
Look.

476
00:20:32,678 --> 00:20:34,145
It's heading
toward the boathouse.

00:20:34,213 --> 00:20:35,874
( <i>explosion</i> )

478
00:20:39,952 --> 00:20:41,749
What do you think?

479
00:20:41,821 --> 00:20:43,550
Run?

480
00:20:43,623 --> 00:20:44,988
Yeah. I'd run.

481
00:20:52,265 --> 00:20:54,563
( <i>door opening</i> )

482
00:20:56,102 --> 00:20:57,399
I figured it out.

483
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:59,233
Hal, you okay?

484
00:21:00,473 --> 00:21:03,408
Whenever we'd fight,
you'd yell, then I'd yell

485
00:21:03,476 --> 00:21:05,444
but then we would...
you know?

486
00:21:05,511 --> 00:21:07,570
Well, you see, we haven't
had a chance to...

487
00:21:07,647 --> 00:21:09,638
because we're in that
trailer with kids...

488
00:21:09,715 --> 00:21:11,945
Oh, my God, Hal,
you're right.

489
00:21:12,018 --> 00:21:13,076
What are we going to do?

490
00:21:13,152 --> 00:21:14,141
We've got the kids...

491
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:15,847
I've got it all figured out.
