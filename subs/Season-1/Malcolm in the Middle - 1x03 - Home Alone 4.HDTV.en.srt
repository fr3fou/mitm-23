Okay, she gave him an out.

Apologize for what?
I wasn't going to do anything.

Just stop talking and let me think!

- Let's go tell him.
- No.

135

You know how Francis gets
when people tell him what to do.

136

I am warning you.

you are going to military school.

Right.

What are we going to do?

00:06:32,835 --> 00:06:34,462
We're going to be good, that's what.

144

it's never come up before.

147

Look, we're just not
going to do anything.

148
00:06:41,544 --> 00:06:43,512
That way, we can't
get in any trouble.

149
00:06:43,579 --> 00:06:47,640
Honey. We're late.
We better hit the road.

150
00:06:47,716 --> 00:06:50,344
Fine. I'll shave my legs
in the car.

151
00:06:50,419 --> 00:06:51,647
Okay.

152
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,712
I've marked the liquor bottles, and
we can taste when they're watered down.

153
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:57,281
I've locked out the smut channel,
counted your father's cigars.

154
00:06:57,359 --> 00:07:00,260
I've checked the odometer on the car
and the balance on the credit cards.

We love you, have a good time.

156
00:07:01,964 --> 00:07:05,422
And just remember, Dewey will tell us
everything you did while we're gone.

157
00:07:05,501 --> 00:07:07,662
Uh, what your mother said, boys.

158
00:07:07,736 --> 00:07:09,704
Minus one.

159
00:07:13,609 --> 00:07:17,375
Don't even think about it.

160

the coolest thing you have ever seen.

Get me some lighter fluid, a waffle iron
and one of Dewey's stuffed animals.
