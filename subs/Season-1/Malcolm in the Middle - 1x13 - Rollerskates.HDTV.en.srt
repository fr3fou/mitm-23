Yes, it is.
It's absolutely fair.

- No, I don't.

We all have 29 inches

I have two four-inchers, five
three-inchers and three two-inchers.

You have five five-inchers

- They're exactly the same.
- Dewey.

My dad was some kind of skating champion
a long time ago.

47
00:02:28,261 --> 00:02:30,388
He made a rule-- no one
in the family could buy skates...

48
00:02:30,464 --> 00:02:32,455
until <i>after</i> they take lessons from him.

You don't get it.

51
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:38,868
My dad's like a total fanatic
about skating.

52
00:02:38,939 --> 00:02:40,600
He doesn't even call it skating.

53
00:02:40,674 --> 00:02:43,404
He calls it
''the brotherhood of the wheel.''

54

He taught Francis and Reese
and they've never been the same after.

Hey, Reese, remember when
Dad taught you how to skate?

59

I don't want to talk about it.

Why can't you just tell me
what it was like?

One, I'm not supposed to, and two,

You know you're not supposed
to skate in the house.

just holler--

but not too loud--

80
