1
00:00:04,657 --> 00:00:05,817
Who wants to make five bucks?

2
00:00:05,892 --> 00:00:06,790
All:
How?

3
00:00:06,859 --> 00:00:07,985
I need someone

4
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:09,493
to take the fall.

5
00:00:09,562 --> 00:00:11,393
- Lois: Oh, my God!
- What did you do?

6
00:00:11,464 --> 00:00:12,556
I can't tell you.

7
00:00:12,632 --> 00:00:13,894
Yes or no,
no questions asked.

8
00:00:13,966 --> 00:00:15,297
Lois:
Oh, my God!

9
00:00:15,368 --> 00:00:16,562
Make it ten.

10
00:00:16,636 --> 00:00:18,228
Done.

11
00:00:18,304 --> 00:00:19,464
Lois:
Oh, my God!

12
00:00:19,538 --> 00:00:20,732
You're a good son.

13
00:00:20,806 --> 00:00:21,966
I got him, honey!

14
00:00:22,041 --> 00:00:24,475
I got him!
Don't worry.

15
00:00:24,543 --> 00:00:27,979
? Yes, no, maybe ?

16
00:00:28,047 --> 00:00:30,515
? I don't know ?

17
00:00:30,583 --> 00:00:33,848
? Can you repeat the question? ?

18
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,115
? You're not the boss of me now ?

19
00:00:36,188 --> 00:00:38,520
? You're not the boss of me now ?

20
00:00:38,591 --> 00:00:40,889
? You're not the boss of me now ?

21
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,019
? And you're not so big ?

22
00:00:43,095 --> 00:00:45,529
? You're not the boss of me now ?

23
00:00:45,598 --> 00:00:47,532
? You're not the boss of me now ?

24
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,034
? You're not the boss of me now ?

25
00:00:50,102 --> 00:00:52,832
? And you're not so big ?

26
00:00:52,905 --> 00:00:57,467
? Life is unfair. ??

27
00:01:00,813 --> 00:01:03,407
There you go--
all pink and shiny.

28
00:01:03,482 --> 00:01:05,609
Mm. Boys?!

29
00:01:08,854 --> 00:01:10,788
Uh-huh. Mm-hmm.

30
00:01:10,856 --> 00:01:12,949
Ooh! Feel ten pounds lighter.

31
00:01:13,025 --> 00:01:14,219
You ready?

32
00:01:14,293 --> 00:01:16,261
Oh, yeah. Go.

33
00:01:17,697 --> 00:01:18,994
Uh, aah...

34
00:01:19,065 --> 00:01:20,396
( <i>rapidly breathing</i> )

35
00:01:20,466 --> 00:01:21,831
Dad got us free tickets

36
00:01:21,901 --> 00:01:23,562
at the water slide park from work.

37
00:01:23,636 --> 00:01:26,196
It takes two days to prep him,
but it's worth it.

38
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:28,035
Ooh, smooth as a seal.

39
00:01:28,107 --> 00:01:29,972
Ready for that water slide.

40
00:01:30,042 --> 00:01:32,340
You know, we haven't been
on an outing in a long time.

41
00:01:32,411 --> 00:01:34,971
It's nice when we can do things
together as a family.

42
00:01:35,047 --> 00:01:37,379
Do what together?

43
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:39,350
( <i>sobbing</i> ):
Why can't I go?

44
00:01:39,418 --> 00:01:40,817
Dewey, we discussed this.

45
00:01:40,886 --> 00:01:43,081
You have to stay home
because of your ear infection.

46
00:01:43,155 --> 00:01:45,419
I never get to go.

47
00:01:45,491 --> 00:01:46,981
Honey, I know it seems
like a pattern

48
00:01:47,059 --> 00:01:47,991
but it's just this.

49
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,322
And Disneyland.

50
00:01:49,395 --> 00:01:51,056
( <i>whimpering</i> )

51
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:53,155
Oh, and that
chocolate factory tour.

52
00:01:53,232 --> 00:01:55,598
Maybe it's time to stop sticking
dirty things in your ears.

53
00:01:55,668 --> 00:01:56,430
Reese:
Hey, Dewey.

54
00:01:56,502 --> 00:01:58,561
How's the ear?

55
00:01:58,637 --> 00:02:00,696
Stop teasing him, Reese!

56
00:02:00,773 --> 00:02:04,368
If your father doesn't find
a baby-sitter, nobody's going anywhere.

57
00:02:04,443 --> 00:02:06,638
Oh, no, no, no.
It's just the little one.

58
00:02:06,712 --> 00:02:09,840
Yeah, the other two aren't
going to be anywhere near you.

59
00:02:09,915 --> 00:02:11,314
Ever since I can remember

60
00:02:11,384 --> 00:02:14,012
we've always had trouble
with baby-sitters.

61
00:02:14,086 --> 00:02:15,280
( <i>cooing</i> ):
Hello!

62
00:02:15,354 --> 00:02:17,015
Goochy, goochy, goochy, goo.

63
00:02:17,089 --> 00:02:18,021
Goochy, goochy...

64
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:19,717
( <i>screaming</i> )

65
00:02:19,792 --> 00:02:21,487
Woman:
I don't know, sweetie.

66
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,687
What <i>do</i> you have
behind your back?

67
00:02:23,763 --> 00:02:26,027
( <i>screaming</i> )

68
00:02:29,835 --> 00:02:32,065
Man: You little losers.
I've had enough of this.

69
00:02:32,138 --> 00:02:33,730
You open this door right now.

70
00:02:33,806 --> 00:02:35,899
Okay, look.
I'm a little claustrophobic.

71
00:02:35,975 --> 00:02:39,342
Just open the door!
Let me out! Come on!

72
00:02:39,412 --> 00:02:40,401
I don't know.

73
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:42,470
I'm starting to think
it might be us.

74
00:02:44,784 --> 00:02:46,718
Well, you'd think I'd get bored

75
00:02:46,786 --> 00:02:48,947
wiping the floor with my cadets.

76
00:02:49,021 --> 00:02:50,852
God knows we enjoy it, sir.

77
00:02:50,923 --> 00:02:53,892
Do you know what
your problem is, cadet?

78
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,555
Discipline.

79
00:02:56,629 --> 00:02:59,120
Anything worth doing
is worth doing well.

80
00:02:59,198 --> 00:03:02,031
Whatever I do,
whether it's teaching you boys

81
00:03:02,101 --> 00:03:06,902
or mastering tai chi,
or playing pool...

82
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:09,838
I focus.

83
00:03:09,909 --> 00:03:11,399
I push myself.

84
00:03:11,477 --> 00:03:13,638
But you don't commit
to anything, son.

85
00:03:13,712 --> 00:03:15,907
You're never going to be a winner

86
00:03:15,981 --> 00:03:19,974
because you do everything half-assed.

87
00:03:22,154 --> 00:03:23,644
Oh, regrettable.

88
00:03:23,722 --> 00:03:26,384
You may have spoken too soon, sir.

89
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:30,418
I think you'll find I play pool
with my whole ass.

90
00:03:30,496 --> 00:03:32,521
Eight ball, corner pocket.

91
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:35,826
Damn.

92
00:03:35,901 --> 00:03:37,596
Ah, the fatal scratch.

93
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:40,639
Once again,
I waltz with Lady Victory.

94
00:03:40,706 --> 00:03:43,004
And until you focus, Francis

95
00:03:43,075 --> 00:03:47,307
she is never going to be
your dance partner.

96
00:03:47,379 --> 00:03:49,370
Lois: Thank you for coming
on such short notice.

97
00:03:49,448 --> 00:03:52,679
It was so nice of your agency
to give us a second chance.

98
00:03:52,751 --> 00:03:55,515
You two are going to have
so much fun together.

99
00:03:55,588 --> 00:03:58,386
( <i>quietly</i> ):
Don't you dare hurt her.

100
00:03:58,457 --> 00:04:01,483
Hurry,
the sun's coming up!

101
00:04:06,899 --> 00:04:09,390
Do you want to play something?

102
00:04:11,003 --> 00:04:12,368
No.

103
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:15,971
Hey, hey, look, kids.

104
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:19,499
- Only 1 2 more miles to Wavetown, USA.
- Yay.

105
00:04:19,578 --> 00:04:22,138
So, Malcolm, you going to go
down the Liquidator this time?

106
00:04:22,214 --> 00:04:23,340
Don't pressure the boy, Hal.

107
00:04:23,415 --> 00:04:25,383
I'm not pressuring him.
I'm just asking.

108
00:04:25,451 --> 00:04:27,248
He's scared enough as it is

109
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:29,844
without you making
a big deal out of it.

110
00:04:32,725 --> 00:04:34,818
Hey, Mom, doesn't
Malcolm have to wear

111
00:04:34,894 --> 00:04:36,987
- his nose plug for his sinuses?
- Shut up.

112
00:04:37,062 --> 00:04:38,495
Oh, that's right.

113
00:04:38,564 --> 00:04:39,588
I forgot it.

114
00:04:39,665 --> 00:04:41,656
Listen, you just be
very careful then, okay?

115
00:04:41,734 --> 00:04:43,895
Don't worry, here it is.

116
00:04:43,969 --> 00:04:45,834
Oh. Thank you, Reese.

117
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:49,539
( <i>whispers</i> ):
Jerk.

118
00:04:49,608 --> 00:04:50,768
Oh, my gosh, look at this!

119
00:04:50,843 --> 00:04:51,935
Reese:
This is awesome!

120
00:04:52,011 --> 00:04:53,501
I can't wait
to get on the rides.

121
00:04:57,917 --> 00:05:01,011
Malcolm, don't think you can
take off that nose plug

122
00:05:01,086 --> 00:05:02,383
just because I'm not looking.

123
00:05:02,454 --> 00:05:04,718
You're going
to wear it all day.

124
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:06,257
- I'm not even in the water.
- If I catch you

125
00:05:06,325 --> 00:05:09,089
not wearing that nose plug,
you're going to spend the day

126
00:05:09,161 --> 00:05:11,061
in the kiddie sprinkler.

127
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:12,529
What do you want to do first?

128
00:05:12,598 --> 00:05:15,192
What makes you think I want
to do anything with you?

129
00:05:15,267 --> 00:05:16,529
What's your problem?

130
00:05:16,602 --> 00:05:18,502
That nose-plug thing was bogus.

131
00:05:18,571 --> 00:05:20,198
You crossed the line, Reese.

132
00:05:20,272 --> 00:05:21,204
What?!

133
00:05:21,273 --> 00:05:22,331
You sold me out to Mom.

134
00:05:22,408 --> 00:05:23,602
It would've been different

135
00:05:23,676 --> 00:05:25,439
if I had done
something to you, but...

136
00:05:25,511 --> 00:05:26,910
that was
totally cold-blooded.

137
00:05:26,979 --> 00:05:28,071
Don't be such a baby.

138
00:05:28,147 --> 00:05:30,206
What you did to me
was an act of war.

139
00:05:30,282 --> 00:05:32,011
And believe me,
I <i>will</i> get you back.

140
00:05:32,084 --> 00:05:34,609
You won't know where or when,
but you're gonna pay.

141
00:05:34,687 --> 00:05:36,416
You sound funny.

142
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:42,616
You wanted to see me, sir?

143
00:05:42,695 --> 00:05:45,061
I just got a call
from the sheriff

144
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:47,690
that a cocksure,
smart-mouthed youth

145
00:05:47,766 --> 00:05:49,927
looking very much like yourself

146
00:05:50,002 --> 00:05:52,903
has been <i>hustling</i> pool
at the local bars.

147
00:05:52,972 --> 00:05:54,064
Really, sir?

148
00:05:54,139 --> 00:05:56,266
You are in serious trouble,
cadet.

149
00:05:56,342 --> 00:05:57,274
I can explain...

150
00:05:57,343 --> 00:05:58,833
Why have you been holding back

151
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:00,173
when we've played pool?

152
00:06:00,246 --> 00:06:01,770
What?

153
00:06:01,847 --> 00:06:04,577
I want to know why
you've been letting me win.

154
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:06,083
Sir, if I played for real

155
00:06:06,151 --> 00:06:08,051
I'd just end up humiliating you

156
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,111
in front of the school, and...

157
00:06:11,323 --> 00:06:13,621
and you'd, you know,
torture us all for it.

158
00:06:13,692 --> 00:06:16,126
Really, nothing good
could come from it, and

159
00:06:16,195 --> 00:06:18,925
and besides, winning seems
to make you so happy.

160
00:06:18,998 --> 00:06:20,590
I am not a child.

161
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:21,997
Do you really think me

162
00:06:22,067 --> 00:06:24,592
so petty that
I would throw a tantrum

163
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:27,195
over something so small
as a game of pool?!

164
00:06:27,273 --> 00:06:28,968
My mistake, sir.

165
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:30,474
We are going to play again.

166
00:06:30,542 --> 00:06:32,134
And <i>you</i> are going to give me

167
00:06:32,211 --> 00:06:34,372
your best game, cadet.

168
00:06:34,446 --> 00:06:37,813
And to make sure of that,
if you don't win

169
00:06:37,883 --> 00:06:42,684
picture yourself, 0400,
awakened from sweet dreams of Mommy

170
00:06:42,755 --> 00:06:44,518
sent outside
into the bitter cold

171
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:45,887
to raise our school colors

172
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:47,858
and stand at attention
for three hours

173
00:06:47,926 --> 00:06:49,223
until reveille is called.

174
00:06:49,295 --> 00:06:51,627
Now, picture <i>that</i>

175
00:06:51,697 --> 00:06:54,791
for 230 consecutive days.

176
00:06:54,867 --> 00:06:57,461
But what if I try my best
and I still lose?

177
00:06:57,536 --> 00:06:59,868
Then you shall be miserable indeed.

178
00:06:59,938 --> 00:07:01,371
Dismissed.

179
00:07:03,208 --> 00:07:05,335
Remember, honey,
how I promised you

180
00:07:05,411 --> 00:07:07,140
that exotic island vacation

181
00:07:07,212 --> 00:07:09,271
but we had to go have
children instead?

182
00:07:09,348 --> 00:07:10,610
Mm-hmm.

183
00:07:10,683 --> 00:07:11,843
Well, I was thinking

184
00:07:11,917 --> 00:07:14,750
maybe today could be
our little island getaway.

185
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:18,017
We've got the sun,
the sand, the palm trees.

186
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:21,355
And I brought the cocktails.

187
00:07:21,427 --> 00:07:23,258
It's Malibu Rum
in a lotion bottle

188
00:07:23,329 --> 00:07:24,489
so no one will know
the difference.

You are so cute when
you sneak in alcohol.

00:07:33,772 --> 00:07:36,263
Hey, Reese, I think I just saw
that girl you liked.

192

You know, the one with
the really long blonde hair.

193

- April?
- April, that's her.

194
00:07:40,746 --> 00:07:42,373
Why'd you say you liked her again?

195
00:07:42,448 --> 00:07:43,642
She's real trampy.

196
00:07:43,716 --> 00:07:45,547
I hear she kisses with tongue.

197
00:07:45,617 --> 00:07:47,448
Is that true, April?

198
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:52,650

No. I'll take care of it.

Lois: Malcolm, Reese,

Can I watch TV?

No.

00:08:41,206 --> 00:08:42,332
Something quiet.

Keep your arms and legs

Do not bend your legs.

Remove all piercings.

You may not wear
anything around neck.

Oh, no, no, no, no.

First, we sort
by the number of holes

then by color.

235

What's in your mouth?

Nothing.

There are at least 20 things
I will not tolerate

and lying is one of them.

Look, guys,
I know you want me to lose

I play a real game.

Francis, you can't win.

258

If you do, Spangler's
going to take it out on us.

We couldn't watch anything

And that was during
pledge drive, man.

Do you have any idea

what Spangler's going
to do to me if I lose?

You have done nothing
but pester us.

enjoy one day?

I don't want to hear it.

You either take care
of this yourself

or I'm going to lock the two of you

And then, I was playing
with my imaginary friend

00:13:39,838 --> 00:13:42,204

because he said

I shouldn't talk to myself.

Well, Reese
is a horrid little boy.

There's nothing wrong
with having an imaginary friend.

I talk to my Harold
all the time.

He's here right now.

I've seen professionals
do much worse.

That's okay, sir.

Sir, what are you doing?

312
00:14:33,658 --> 00:14:34,750
I think I'm losing.

313
00:14:34,826 --> 00:14:36,794
And gracefully,
I'd like to be noted.

314
00:14:36,862 --> 00:14:38,420
But you could have
made that shot.

315
00:14:38,497 --> 00:14:39,930
I could say
the same thing to you.

316
00:14:39,998 --> 00:14:42,432
There were at least a dozen
shots that you've held back on.

317
00:14:42,501 --> 00:14:45,732
But since you seem to be
motivated more by losing

318
00:14:45,804 --> 00:14:47,396
I'm going to beat you
at your own game.

Huh?

I'm going down hard.

322
00:14:51,243 --> 00:14:53,575
But sir, these guys are going
to kick my ass if I win.

323
00:14:53,645 --> 00:14:55,078
Well, that's just gravy.

324
00:14:55,147 --> 00:14:57,172
May the best man lose.

325
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,354
Fudge! It seems
I've scratched again.
