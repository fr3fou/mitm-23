of a suggestion.

488
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:17,772
''The horse you rode in on''
is optional.

489
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:18,976
Now, look--

490
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,177
No, you look.

491
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:21,219
I don't deserve this.

492
00:20:21,287 --> 00:20:22,754
The only thing
I ever did wrong

493
00:20:22,821 --> 00:20:24,812
was all the work I did
to cover your butt.

494
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,222
We obviously have different
definitions of''wrong.''

495
00:20:27,293 --> 00:20:28,783
Yeah, I guess we do.

496
00:20:28,861 --> 00:20:30,351
For instance,
I think it's wrong

497
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:32,420
for you to put your name
on sales reports

498
00:20:32,498 --> 00:20:33,760
that you didn't write.

499
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:35,800
I think it's wrong you keep
a little bag of''herbs''

500
00:20:35,868 --> 00:20:37,426
in your bottom left drawer.

501
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:39,471
And slept with
the district manager's wife.

502
00:20:39,538 --> 00:20:41,369
And you want
to know something?

503
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,499
You don't even
have to worry about it

504
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:46,942
because I also think it's wrong
to blab this kind of thing.

505
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:48,741
You know,
you should be so glad

506
00:20:48,814 --> 00:20:50,611
that I'm
the only one that knows

507
00:20:50,683 --> 00:20:53,117
this stuff about you.

508
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:56,643
Anyone else here would sell you
down the river in a second.

509
00:20:59,725 --> 00:21:02,592
God, I am so much
better than you.

510
00:21:07,499 --> 00:21:08,625
( <i>Clearing Throat</i> )

511
00:21:15,975 --> 00:21:19,240
Yeah, he just ran off
and quit for no reason.

512
00:21:19,311 --> 00:21:20,869
Huh, who knows why?

513
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:23,210
See, you do the right thing

514
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:26,445
and everything
works out for the best.

515
00:21:28,087 --> 00:21:29,679
Clean.

516
00:21:29,755 --> 00:21:33,350
I have Ho-Ho's-- real Ho-Ho's.

517
00:21:33,425 --> 00:21:35,222
You know,
I'm sure I'm neglecting

518
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:36,693
my spiritual side, but...

519
00:21:36,762 --> 00:21:38,024
money rules.

520
00:21:38,097 --> 00:21:39,689
The best part is

521
00:21:39,765 --> 00:21:43,166
I can finally get everything
straightened out with Julie.

522
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:44,361
Hi, Malcolm.

523
00:21:44,436 --> 00:21:45,835
Look, we're not poor anymore!

524
00:21:45,904 --> 00:21:48,395
So I don't want any more
of your stupid pity, okay?

525
00:21:51,243 --> 00:21:53,040
That helped, right?
