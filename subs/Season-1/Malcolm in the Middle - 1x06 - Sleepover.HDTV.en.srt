Hey, Stevie, I got your...

503
00:20:42,265 --> 00:20:44,199
Oh, my God!

504
00:20:44,267 --> 00:20:46,292
Stevie, are you okay?!

505
00:20:46,369 --> 00:20:50,965
Can't feel... my legs.

506
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,167
That's not funny.

507
00:20:53,243 --> 00:20:55,211
Lois:
Is there anything I can do

508
00:20:55,278 --> 00:20:57,542
to get out of the ticket,
Officer?

509
00:20:57,614 --> 00:20:59,081
Hal:
Just love me.

510
00:20:59,148 --> 00:21:00,740
Aw, geez, Hal--
Is that it?

511
00:21:00,817 --> 00:21:02,478
Can't he be a
sensitive cop?

512
00:21:08,324 --> 00:21:11,122
Woman:
That puppet-- It's <i>alive!</i>

513
00:21:14,998 --> 00:21:17,364
Tonight was...

514
00:21:17,433 --> 00:21:18,764
awesome.

515
00:21:18,835 --> 00:21:20,860
Well, we kind of
got lucky.

516
00:21:20,937 --> 00:21:23,633
I was sort of
hoping to get caught.

517
00:21:23,706 --> 00:21:25,367
What?

518
00:21:25,441 --> 00:21:27,602
Never been in trouble.

519
00:21:27,677 --> 00:21:28,735
Like to see

520
00:21:28,811 --> 00:21:30,608
what it's like.

521
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,648
Sometimes
you're such a Krelboyne.

522
00:21:38,421 --> 00:21:43,381
I guess we are
in trouble after all.

523
00:21:43,459 --> 00:21:44,653
Malcolm?

524
00:21:46,362 --> 00:21:47,920
Malcolm.

525
00:21:50,366 --> 00:21:52,129
Malcolm?



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
