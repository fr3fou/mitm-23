Don't worry about it.

Ew! No. This is better.

Oh, my God! Is that real?

It's an open competition.

Killer robots?!

32
00:01:47,366 --> 00:01:48,663
I can't believe it.

33
00:01:48,734 --> 00:01:51,567
Finally something cool
about being smart.

34
00:01:51,637 --> 00:01:53,264
I wish we could do that.

We were hoping you'd say that.

Here's the deal:

We want to enter the competition.

38

We've got the designs,
we've got the desire

and we're not distracted
by any kind of social life.

40
00:02:04,783 --> 00:02:06,341
The only problem
is that our parents

to build something
that dangerous.

That means we need a place

those things
look really expensive.

No problem.

my mom has been

Why?

119
00:04:43,608 --> 00:04:44,905
Because anything

is going to sound reasonable.

That can't be good for you.

168
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,566
Have you had a bowel movement?

169
00:06:17,636 --> 00:06:19,001
When is the last time
you moved your bowels?

170
00:06:19,071 --> 00:06:20,129
Mom...

171
00:06:20,205 --> 00:06:21,229
Hello!

172
00:06:21,306 --> 00:06:23,240
Who are you?

173
00:06:23,308 --> 00:06:24,240
Edwin Spangler.

174
00:06:24,309 --> 00:06:26,140
I am commandant
of Marlin Academy.

175
00:06:26,211 --> 00:06:28,042
Good for you.

176
00:06:28,113 --> 00:06:29,944
Where's your eye?

177
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:31,039
Pardon?

178
00:06:31,116 --> 00:06:32,708
Do your ears work?

179
00:06:32,784 --> 00:06:34,718
Do you have some business
with my son?

180
00:06:34,786 --> 00:06:36,151
He needs to rest.

181
00:06:36,221 --> 00:06:38,746
Well, I stopped by
to pick up your boy's homework.

182
00:06:38,824 --> 00:06:40,849
Homework?!
You're not giving him homework.

183
00:06:40,926 --> 00:06:42,359
My son nearly lost his life--

184
00:06:42,427 --> 00:06:44,019
something that never
would've happened

185

if you'd taken proper care of him
in the first place.

186

You listen to me, you idiot!

My child is sick.

He does not need you marching
in here, puffing up your chest

192

of crazy dreamer?

Well, what about my design for

- It's a...

The perfect killing machine.

221
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:37,269
It's too unreliable.

222
00:08:37,342 --> 00:08:39,469
It's got to be more simple,
like a sledgehammer...

What's this stuff?

226

Let's have a look.

Well... I'd go
with the flame thrower.

230

That would destroy everything
within a ten-foot perimeter.

231

Of course,
there's a lot to be said

for that high-voltage probe.

233
00:09:00,732 --> 00:09:03,792
Sir, before you continue,
I feel I have to mention

234
00:09:03,868 --> 00:09:06,860
that our parents
strongly disapprove of this.

235
00:09:08,473 --> 00:09:11,840
Sorry, my therapist
says it's a compulsion.

236
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:14,037
Well, I guess you shouldn't
tell your parents, then.

Wow.

238
00:09:19,484 --> 00:09:22,009
Your father's
lack of responsibility

239
00:09:22,087 --> 00:09:23,850
is both terrifying and...

240
00:09:23,922 --> 00:09:25,549
oddly thrilling.

241
00:09:32,297 --> 00:09:34,959
I can't apologize enough
for these barbaric accommodations.

242
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:37,058
You deserve so much more.

243

Oh, no, this is fine.

It does wonders
for the local economy

the crowds for everything.

Dad, you have to stop it!

492
00:19:29,427 --> 00:19:30,553
You're right.

493
00:19:32,096 --> 00:19:33,791
I've got better things to do.

494
00:19:33,865 --> 00:19:35,560
Dad, what are you doing?

495
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:37,624
I think me
and Lois number two here

496
00:19:37,702 --> 00:19:38,930
are going to go down to work

497
00:19:39,003 --> 00:19:41,528
and pay a little visit
to Mr.Jackson's Lexus.

498
00:19:43,407 --> 00:19:44,635
Dad, don't move.

499
00:19:44,709 --> 00:19:45,641
( <i>loud whirring</i> )

500
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:46,677
What are you doing?

501
00:19:46,744 --> 00:19:48,609
I'm stopping you
from quitting your job

502
00:19:48,679 --> 00:19:50,806
by threatening you
with a killer robot.

503
00:19:50,882 --> 00:19:53,510
I wish this felt half
as cool as it sounds.

504
00:19:53,584 --> 00:19:55,882
Just turn it off, Malcolm.

505
00:19:55,953 --> 00:19:57,147
Stop being crazy.

506
00:19:57,221 --> 00:19:59,746
Just put the remote down.

507
00:20:01,259 --> 00:20:04,888
You have no idea what
this machine is capable of.

508
00:20:04,962 --> 00:20:06,429
Why don't you just sit down?

509
00:20:06,497 --> 00:20:09,193
And why don't you just
put the remote down?

510
00:20:09,267 --> 00:20:10,598
Dad, please.

511
00:20:10,668 --> 00:20:12,260
Malcolm...

512
00:20:16,507 --> 00:20:18,600
Why don't you both
just shut up?!

513
00:20:20,678 --> 00:20:21,975
( <i>clicks</i> )

514
00:20:22,046 --> 00:20:24,207
( <i>whirring</i> )

515
00:20:28,753 --> 00:20:30,414
Run. No kidding. Run.

516
00:20:32,623 --> 00:20:35,057
( <i>buzzing</i> )

517
00:20:35,126 --> 00:20:36,559
Oh, no.

518
00:20:56,614 --> 00:21:01,108
( <i>muffled</i> ):
Call... animal... control.

519
00:21:01,185 --> 00:21:03,210
You ripped the phone
out of the wall.

520
00:21:03,287 --> 00:21:08,884
Go... to... the neighbor.

521
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,951
They won't let us over anymore.

522
00:21:11,028 --> 00:21:15,226
Do... something.

523
00:21:15,299 --> 00:21:16,960
Why don't we just all sit down

524
00:21:17,034 --> 00:21:18,433
and no one will do anything

525
00:21:18,502 --> 00:21:19,833
until Mom gets home?

526
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:22,398
Okay.

527
00:21:30,047 --> 00:21:32,140
( <i>cheering</i> )

528
00:21:32,216 --> 00:21:34,980
I got to say,
as far as gay rodeos go

529
00:21:35,052 --> 00:21:36,747
this one's pretty entertaining.

530
00:21:36,821 --> 00:21:38,345
Are you sure you're
not embarrassed

531
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:40,356
to be seen with your mother?

532
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:41,891
Nah.

533
00:21:41,959 --> 00:21:44,450
