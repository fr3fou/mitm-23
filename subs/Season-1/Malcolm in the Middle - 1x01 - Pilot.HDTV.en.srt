1
00:00:02,249 --> 00:00:04,479
Malcolm:
This is the world--

2
00:00:04,551 --> 00:00:07,213
1 96 million square miles.

3
00:00:07,287 --> 00:00:09,517
If I covered 1 00 square miles
an hour

4
00:00:09,589 --> 00:00:11,523
every hour
for the rest of my life

5
00:00:11,591 --> 00:00:13,456
I'd still only see half of it.

6
00:00:13,527 --> 00:00:14,926
( Squeaking )

7
00:00:14,995 --> 00:00:17,828
This is the left nostril
of my brother Reese.

8
00:00:17,898 --> 00:00:21,265
It squeaks all night long.

9
00:00:21,335 --> 00:00:23,098
These are the freezing cold feet

10
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:25,263
of my little brother... Dewey.

11
00:00:25,339 --> 00:00:27,307
This is my oldest brother Francis.

12
00:00:27,374 --> 00:00:29,103
He's the one I really like

13
00:00:29,176 --> 00:00:31,906
so, of course,
he got sent to military school.

14
00:00:31,978 --> 00:00:33,104
My name is Malcolm.

15
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,148
You want to know
what the best thing

16
00:00:35,215 --> 00:00:36,307
about childhood is?

17
00:00:36,383 --> 00:00:38,783
At some point, it stops.

18
00:01:23,196 --> 00:01:26,893
Malcolm, Reese, Dewey,
get in here!

19
00:01:29,569 --> 00:01:31,161
- Stop!
- I'm not touching you!

20
00:01:31,238 --> 00:01:32,466
There's only two toaster waffles.

21
00:01:32,539 --> 00:01:33,665
One of you has to have cereal.

22
00:01:35,242 --> 00:01:36,266
It's mine!

23
00:01:36,343 --> 00:01:37,367
Come on!

24
00:01:37,444 --> 00:01:38,536
Give it!

25
00:01:38,612 --> 00:01:39,704
You cheated!

26
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:40,872
Give it! Give it!

27
00:01:40,947 --> 00:01:43,916
Huh, look at this.

28
00:01:43,984 --> 00:01:46,544
They're sending
an unmanned probe to Venus

29
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:49,555
and letting a bunch
of schoolchildren name it.

30
00:01:49,623 --> 00:01:51,181
That's going to end badly.

31
00:01:51,258 --> 00:01:53,590
These clippers are dull already.

32
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,855
Honestly, Hal,
you're like a monkey.

33
00:01:55,929 --> 00:01:57,362
They do this every month.

34
00:01:57,431 --> 00:01:58,728
He has sensitive skin.

35
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,495
The hair gets itchy under his clothes.

36
00:02:01,568 --> 00:02:03,126
It always seems like such a shame

37
00:02:03,203 --> 00:02:04,693
to just dump this in the trash.

38
00:02:04,771 --> 00:02:06,932
Maybe birds would like
to make nests with it

39
00:02:07,007 --> 00:02:09,237
or maybe you boys could
use it for school projects.

40
00:02:10,477 --> 00:02:13,674
Arms up.

41
00:02:13,747 --> 00:02:16,045
Dude.

42
00:02:16,116 --> 00:02:18,050
Malcolm, come right home
from school.

43
00:02:18,118 --> 00:02:20,052
I made a play date for you with Stevie
Kenarban and you have to take a bath.

44
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,644
What? Mom, no!

45
00:02:21,721 --> 00:02:22,983
Malcolm has a play date?!

46
00:02:23,056 --> 00:02:24,318
Shut up, Reese!

47
00:02:24,391 --> 00:02:26,359
With Stevie ''The Wheelie'' Kenarban?

48
00:02:26,426 --> 00:02:27,825
Oh, man!

49
00:02:27,894 --> 00:02:30,556
( Coughing )

50
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,992
Breathing.

51
00:02:37,037 --> 00:02:40,029
So, Malcolm,
why is playing a problem?

52
00:02:40,106 --> 00:02:42,131
First off

53
00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:43,938
I don't even know Stevie.

54
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:45,739
His mother said
you boys ate lunch together.

55
00:02:45,812 --> 00:02:46,870
One time.

56
00:02:46,947 --> 00:02:49,313
He rolled his wheelchair
over next to me.

57
00:02:49,382 --> 00:02:51,714
It's not like
I could say, ''Go away.''

58
00:02:51,785 --> 00:02:53,309
He's not even in my class.

59
00:02:53,386 --> 00:02:54,751
He's in the Krelboyne class

60
00:02:54,821 --> 00:02:56,516
in the trailer
next to tetherball.

61
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:58,114
You listen to me, young man.

62
00:02:58,191 --> 00:03:00,250
That one lunch obviously
meant a lot to Stevie.

63
00:03:00,327 --> 00:03:02,056
He's a human being
with human feelings.

64
00:03:02,128 --> 00:03:04,562
Now, you are going to be friends
with that crippled boy

65
00:03:04,631 --> 00:03:06,462
and you are going
to like it. Understood?

66
00:03:06,533 --> 00:03:08,467
Yes, ma'am. Understood.

67
00:03:08,535 --> 00:03:11,800
If I give up now,
I won't get the lecture.

68
00:03:11,872 --> 00:03:12,531
You kids...

69
00:03:12,606 --> 00:03:13,402
Dang.

70
00:03:13,473 --> 00:03:15,065
You just take

71
00:03:15,141 --> 00:03:17,541
your legs for granted like nothing
could ever happen to them.

72
00:03:17,611 --> 00:03:18,942
That is just wishful thinking.

73
00:03:19,012 --> 00:03:20,741
There's meningitis.
There are car accidents.

74
00:03:20,814 --> 00:03:23,044
I could be giving
you a spanking

75
00:03:23,116 --> 00:03:24,743
and accidentally snap
your spinal cord.

76
00:03:24,818 --> 00:03:26,251
Every day is a lottery

77
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,253
and first prize
is that you don't have to scoot

78
00:03:28,321 --> 00:03:30,846
yourself around town on a skateboard
with your hands.

79
00:03:30,924 --> 00:03:32,915
You think about that.

80
00:03:34,661 --> 00:03:37,186
I don't take my legs
for granted, Mom.

81
00:03:37,264 --> 00:03:39,323
I know, honey.
You're a good boy.

82
00:03:39,399 --> 00:03:41,492
Stop playing with yourself.

83
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:44,928
( Boys Arguing )

84
00:03:45,005 --> 00:03:46,802
Go on,just go.

85
00:03:46,873 --> 00:03:48,568
Lois:
No, wait, wait, wait.

86
00:03:48,642 --> 00:03:50,132
Okay, I ran out of ham.

87
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:52,474
One of you has
to have egg salad, okay?

88
00:03:52,546 --> 00:03:54,309
And don't ditch
your little brother.

89
00:03:54,381 --> 00:03:56,144
I don't want him
getting kidnapped.

90
00:03:56,216 --> 00:03:58,377
Yeah, Mom,
that would be terrible.

91
00:03:58,451 --> 00:04:00,476
It's your turn to walk with him.

92
00:04:00,554 --> 00:04:02,488
I walked him yesterday
and the day before.

93
00:04:02,556 --> 00:04:04,649
I walked with him
when he wet his pants.

94
00:04:04,724 --> 00:04:06,157
Okay.

95
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:12,528
Mom said to hold hands.

96
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:14,464
She did not say
to hold hands, Dewey.

97
00:04:14,534 --> 00:04:16,092
I'm not holding hands.

98
00:04:16,169 --> 00:04:17,761
Come on, hold hands. Please?

99
00:04:17,837 --> 00:04:19,964
No! You're in the first grade.

100
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,099
You're too big for that.

101
00:04:22,175 --> 00:04:25,110
Look,
I'm walking right next to you.

102
00:04:25,178 --> 00:04:26,770
You'll be fine.

103
00:04:28,515 --> 00:04:31,814
Damn it! This is why
everyone teases you.

104
00:04:31,885 --> 00:04:33,352
Hey, Malcolm.

105
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:34,682
Hey, Richard.

106
00:04:34,754 --> 00:04:37,245
So my mom was telling
my dad last night

107
00:04:37,324 --> 00:04:38,723
about your brother.

108
00:04:38,792 --> 00:04:40,419
She said he's in jail.

109
00:04:40,493 --> 00:04:41,926
He's not in jail.

110
00:04:41,995 --> 00:04:43,587
He's at Marlin Academy.

111
00:04:43,663 --> 00:04:46,928
It's, like, one of the best
private schools in the country

112
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,729
and it's totally unfair.

113
00:04:48,802 --> 00:04:51,862
Everyone acts like Francis
is just this big troublemaker

114
00:04:51,938 --> 00:04:53,735
and he's not.

115
00:04:53,807 --> 00:04:55,832
Dad, I know what
you're going to say

116
00:04:55,909 --> 00:04:58,241
and believe me,
I totally agree with you.

117
00:04:58,311 --> 00:05:00,245
There is no excuse
for what I did.

118
00:05:00,313 --> 00:05:02,747
It was idiotic, immature,
totally reckless

119
00:05:02,816 --> 00:05:04,408
and I'm really sorry.

120
00:05:04,484 --> 00:05:06,645
I'm just...
I'm hoping against hope

121
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,348
that you will give me
another chance, which, I admit

122
00:05:09,422 --> 00:05:11,014
I don't deserve

123
00:05:11,091 --> 00:05:13,924
but if you could just
find it in your heart

124
00:05:13,994 --> 00:05:15,586
to forgive me

125
00:05:15,662 --> 00:05:17,994
I know I could earn
your trust back.

126

it was even our car.

here's how it works.

130
00:05:26,873 --> 00:05:28,841
You can beg for mercy
on your belly

131

lick the bottom of my shoes

132

or take a beating.

133
00:05:33,013 --> 00:05:35,106
You must pick at least two

134

but... but-but,
if you pick three

135

you get a pass

So you're here to insult
my parenting skills?

333
00:14:23,709 --> 00:14:25,677
No. I'm sure you're
a terrific parent.

334
00:14:25,745 --> 00:14:26,973
( Screaming )

335
00:14:27,046 --> 00:14:28,980
Who's the baby now?

336
00:14:31,117 --> 00:14:32,448
I'm here because I think

337
00:14:32,518 --> 00:14:35,146
that there is a tremendous
opportunity for...

338
00:14:35,221 --> 00:14:37,621
Could you, you know,
maybe put a top on?

339
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:38,782
They're just boobs, lady.

340
00:14:38,858 --> 00:14:40,382
You see them in the mirror
every morning.

341
00:14:40,459 --> 00:14:42,154
I'm sure yours
are a lot nicer than mine.

342
00:14:42,228 --> 00:14:43,160
That's actually not...

343
00:14:43,229 --> 00:14:44,457
Let me tell you something else.

344
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:45,792
The reason I didn't respond

345
00:14:45,865 --> 00:14:47,127
is because it is a load of crap.

346
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,360
What?

347
00:14:48,434 --> 00:14:49,924
You are not going
to stick my Malcolm

348
00:14:50,002 --> 00:14:51,026
in some special ed class.

349
00:14:51,103 --> 00:14:52,434
What is it with you people?

350
00:14:52,505 --> 00:14:53,995
Why do you have to label everybody?

351
00:14:54,073 --> 00:14:55,438
Malcolm may be a little strange

352
00:14:55,508 --> 00:14:57,408
and, I know, I know,
he never shuts up

353
00:14:57,476 --> 00:14:58,704
but he is not disturbed.

354
00:14:58,778 --> 00:15:00,177
You know, he is a good boy...

355
00:15:00,246 --> 00:15:02,043
Please!

356
00:15:02,114 --> 00:15:03,206
You know what?

357
00:15:03,282 --> 00:15:04,977
You don't understand at all, okay?

358
00:15:05,051 --> 00:15:07,076
So if I could just
come in for a minute

359
00:15:07,153 --> 00:15:09,451
I could explain everything,
okay?

360
00:15:11,757 --> 00:15:14,191
Reese:
Ow! Ow! Ow!

361
00:15:43,422 --> 00:15:44,514
Good, hon.

362
00:15:46,225 --> 00:15:47,453
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

363
00:15:47,526 --> 00:15:49,255
There's something
we have to talk about.

364
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:56,893
I thought we weren't
going to mention that

365
00:15:56,969 --> 00:15:58,129
until after the biopsy.

366
00:15:58,204 --> 00:15:59,068
It's not that.

367
00:15:59,138 --> 00:16:00,230
It's about Malcolm.

368
00:16:00,306 --> 00:16:01,034
I didn't do it.

369
00:16:01,107 --> 00:16:02,005
He did it. I saw him.

370
00:16:02,074 --> 00:16:03,803
A teacher from school came by

371
00:16:03,876 --> 00:16:05,969
and she ran
some tests with Malcolm.

372
00:16:06,045 --> 00:16:09,310
He has an IQ of 1 65.

373
00:16:09,382 --> 00:16:11,782
Who?

374
00:16:11,851 --> 00:16:14,115
Malcolm. He's a genius.

375
00:16:14,186 --> 00:16:15,551
He's going to a special class.

376
00:16:15,621 --> 00:16:16,849
What?

377
00:16:16,922 --> 00:16:18,514
Malcolm's special?

378
00:16:18,591 --> 00:16:19,888
Where do you think that came from?

379
00:16:19,959 --> 00:16:21,859
They have a special program
for gifted children.

380
00:16:21,927 --> 00:16:23,986
They have advanced textbooks
and devoted teachers

381
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:26,463
and good things they don't want
to waste on normal kids.

382
00:16:26,532 --> 00:16:27,794
You start on Monday.

383
00:16:27,867 --> 00:16:29,801
In the Krelboyne class?

384
00:16:29,869 --> 00:16:31,837
Mom, no. I don't want to.

385
00:16:31,904 --> 00:16:33,804
What are you talking about?

386
00:16:33,873 --> 00:16:35,500
Of course you want to.

387
00:16:35,574 --> 00:16:37,542
No. I want to stay
in my own class.

388
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:39,874
I don't want to be a Krelboyne.

389
00:16:39,945 --> 00:16:42,311
Mom, seriously, Krelboynes
get their butts kicked.

390
00:16:42,381 --> 00:16:44,781
Just stop one minute.

391
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:47,410
There's nothing wrong
with being smart.

392
00:16:47,486 --> 00:16:48,885
And there's nothing wrong

393
00:16:48,954 --> 00:16:50,546
with being cut from the herd.

394
00:16:50,623 --> 00:16:52,386
It makes you the one buffalo
that isn't there

395
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:53,755
when the Indians run the rest

396
00:16:53,826 --> 00:16:55,760
- of them off the cliff.
- Huh?

397
00:16:55,828 --> 00:16:57,352
Mom, this isn't fair.

398
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:59,364
If I don't want to go,
why do I have to?

399
00:16:59,432 --> 00:17:01,832
Because it's not just up to you.

400
00:17:01,901 --> 00:17:04,062
We have to do what's best for you.

401
00:17:04,136 --> 00:17:05,603
Is Malcolm going to Alabama?

402
00:17:05,671 --> 00:17:08,162
Mom, please!
Don't make me go! Please!

403
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,730
Malcolm, calm down.

404
00:17:09,809 --> 00:17:11,003
But it isn't fair!

405
00:17:11,077 --> 00:17:13,170
That's right. It isn't fair.

406
00:17:13,245 --> 00:17:15,076
It's the first time
anyone in this family

407
00:17:15,147 --> 00:17:16,341
has ever been given an edge

408
00:17:16,415 --> 00:17:17,780
and you are not going to waste it.

409
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:18,839
Dad?

410
00:17:18,918 --> 00:17:19,748
Honey?

411
00:17:21,987 --> 00:17:23,352
Well...

412
00:17:23,422 --> 00:17:25,185
look, honey...

413
00:17:27,593 --> 00:17:31,188
Malcolm, you see...

414
00:17:34,266 --> 00:17:36,359
Oh, for crying out loud.

415
00:17:36,435 --> 00:17:39,131
How come there's never
any iced tea in this pitcher?

416
00:17:39,205 --> 00:17:40,695
I make a fresh batch
every morning

417
00:17:40,773 --> 00:17:42,434
and it's gone
by the time I get home.

418
00:17:42,508 --> 00:17:44,976
I want a better family!

419
00:17:45,044 --> 00:17:48,207
Malcolm...

420
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,373
Go get yogurt.

421
00:17:50,449 --> 00:17:51,711
Look at that.

422
00:17:51,784 --> 00:17:53,217
Gone.

423
00:17:53,285 --> 00:17:55,116
Can't you make iced tea?

424
00:17:55,187 --> 00:17:56,779
No!

425
00:17:56,856 --> 00:17:59,450
I don't want to go
to a special class.

426
00:17:59,525 --> 00:18:01,117
People think
I'm weird enough already.

427
00:18:01,193 --> 00:18:02,660
I know.

428
00:18:02,728 --> 00:18:04,923
I like where I am.
I want to stay.

429
00:18:04,997 --> 00:18:08,330
That's because you don't
understand the world yet.

430
00:18:08,401 --> 00:18:09,993
Sweetie,
life does not give you

431
00:18:10,069 --> 00:18:11,331
a lot of chances to move up

432
00:18:11,404 --> 00:18:13,099
even if you deserve it.

433
00:18:13,172 --> 00:18:14,571
Look at your dad and me.

434
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,167
Malcolm, I'm proud of you.

435
00:18:18,244 --> 00:18:19,905
You boys are so lucky.

436
00:18:19,979 --> 00:18:22,243
You have so many gifts
that other kids don't have.

437
00:18:22,314 --> 00:18:25,511
And I don't just mean
Stevie Kenarban, either.

438
00:18:25,584 --> 00:18:28,417
I mean, look at those
Parker boys across the street.

439
00:18:28,487 --> 00:18:30,079
They may be healthy,
but honest to God

440
00:18:30,156 --> 00:18:31,748
those are the ugliest
little boys ever born.

441
00:18:31,824 --> 00:18:34,054
They look like boiled beets,
don't you think?

442
00:18:34,126 --> 00:18:35,787
And those Henderson kids?

443
00:18:35,861 --> 00:18:37,192
That electrocuted their dog

444
00:18:37,263 --> 00:18:38,696
when they were trying
to get free cable.

445
00:18:38,764 --> 00:18:41,358
How smart can they be?

446
00:18:41,434 --> 00:18:42,799
And your friend Richard.

447
00:18:42,868 --> 00:18:44,426
He's not ugly or dumb.

448
00:18:44,503 --> 00:18:46,471
Yes, but he's very effeminate.

449
00:18:46,539 --> 00:18:48,404
Just remember

450
00:18:48,474 --> 00:18:50,772
any kid who makes fun of you

451
00:18:50,843 --> 00:18:52,435
is a creepy little loser

452
00:18:52,511 --> 00:18:54,103
who'll end up working
in a car wash.

453
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:58,310
This shouldn't make me
feel better, but it does.

454
00:18:58,384 --> 00:19:00,614
You'll be all right, sweetie.

455
00:19:00,686 --> 00:19:02,551
If you don't make
a big deal out of this

456
00:19:02,621 --> 00:19:04,282
nobody else will either.

457
00:19:04,356 --> 00:19:06,017
And I just can't say enough

458
00:19:06,091 --> 00:19:08,685
about how proud
we should all be of Malcolm

459
00:19:08,761 --> 00:19:10,991
for getting into
the gifted program.

460
00:19:11,063 --> 00:19:13,588
Now Malcolm may not look
different than the rest of us

461
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:15,190
but he is.

462
00:19:15,267 --> 00:19:17,258
Very different.

463
00:19:17,336 --> 00:19:19,634
In his brain.

464
00:19:19,705 --> 00:19:22,765
And I think we should
recognize him for that.

465
00:19:26,745 --> 00:19:28,110
Bye.

466
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:30,740
Caroline: All righty,
today we are starting a new section

467
00:19:30,816 --> 00:19:32,408
on the Peloponnesian War

468
00:19:32,485 --> 00:19:35,181
which I know
you are all going to love.

469
00:19:35,254 --> 00:19:37,313
Malcolm?

470
00:19:37,389 --> 00:19:40,415
Are you okay?

471
00:19:41,827 --> 00:19:43,692
Uh, yeah.

472
00:19:43,762 --> 00:19:44,956
Fine.

473
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:45,962
All right.

474
00:19:46,031 --> 00:19:47,293
Excuse me.

475
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,737
Stop staring at me!

476
00:20:06,552 --> 00:20:07,985
Why do they keep doing that?

477
00:20:08,053 --> 00:20:09,452
You're new.

478
00:20:09,522 --> 00:20:10,454
Oh, great.

479
00:20:10,523 --> 00:20:12,548
So I'm the freak
of the freak show?

480
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:15,219
Pi to 50 places.

481
00:20:15,294 --> 00:20:18,161
Mark. Set. Go.

482
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:20,221
3.1 41 592653

483
00:20:20,299 --> 00:20:21,857
5897 93 23--

484
00:20:21,934 --> 00:20:24,232
Turn around,
or I swear to God

485
00:20:24,303 --> 00:20:25,770
I'll kill you.

486
00:20:27,473 --> 00:20:29,532
Just... chill out.

487
00:20:29,608 --> 00:20:30,905
Don't tell me to chill out.

488
00:20:30,976 --> 00:20:32,238
You chill out.

489
00:20:32,311 --> 00:20:33,676
Nobody can live like this.

490
00:20:33,746 --> 00:20:35,714
- I'm okay.
- Oh, sure.

491
00:20:35,781 --> 00:20:38,181
You're okay because it doesn't
make any difference to you.

492
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:39,717
You've always been a freak.

493
00:20:39,785 --> 00:20:42,083
I used to be normal.

494
00:20:42,154 --> 00:20:44,418
Wait.
Who just said that?

495
00:20:46,659 --> 00:20:48,183
You're going to take that
the wrong way

496
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:49,227
aren't you?

497
00:20:49,295 --> 00:20:51,263
You...

498
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:52,922
suck.

499
00:20:58,337 --> 00:21:01,431
It's so cool!

500
00:21:01,507 --> 00:21:04,874
Around here, being smart is
exactly like being radioactive.

501
00:21:18,123 --> 00:21:21,115
I can't believe I'm doing this.

502
00:21:26,332 --> 00:21:28,562
Stevie?

503
00:21:28,634 --> 00:21:30,659
What?

504
00:21:31,971 --> 00:21:34,132
Look

505
00:21:34,206 --> 00:21:37,141
I...

506
00:21:37,209 --> 00:21:38,904
Score!

507
00:21:38,978 --> 00:21:41,446
( Laughing )

508
00:21:41,513 --> 00:21:42,980
Hey, Spath!

509
00:21:43,048 --> 00:21:45,573
Why don't you stop
being such a buttwipe?!

510
00:21:45,651 --> 00:21:47,243
All:
Ooh.

511
00:21:51,323 --> 00:21:52,813
What'd you call me?

512
00:21:52,891 --> 00:21:53,983
You heard me!

513
00:21:54,059 --> 00:21:55,321
I don't care anymore!

514
00:21:55,394 --> 00:21:57,191
I just don't care, Spath, okay?

515
00:21:57,262 --> 00:21:59,594
Alls you ever do
is make everybody miserable!

516
00:21:59,665 --> 00:22:02,031
Except for your little
monkey-slaves over there.

517
00:22:02,101 --> 00:22:04,092
Who, by the way,
only pretend to like you.

518
00:22:04,169 --> 00:22:06,194
They hate you as much
as everyone else does!

519
00:22:06,271 --> 00:22:08,034
And you're just too busy
being mean and stupid

520
00:22:08,107 --> 00:22:09,199
to ever figure it out!

521
00:22:09,274 --> 00:22:12,539
I keep trying to run,
but my legs won't work.

522
00:22:12,611 --> 00:22:15,546
Mom was right:
They are important.

523
00:22:15,614 --> 00:22:16,706
Wow.

524
00:22:16,782 --> 00:22:18,682
I don't know about you

525
00:22:18,751 --> 00:22:21,185
but the Krelboyne
really hurt my feelings.

526
00:22:21,253 --> 00:22:23,050
( Nervous Laughter )

527
00:22:25,224 --> 00:22:26,350
Hey...

528
00:22:26,425 --> 00:22:29,223
Go away, Stevie.

529
00:22:29,294 --> 00:22:30,955
It's good you two are friends.

530
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:33,624
He won't mind sharing
his wheelchair.

531
00:22:33,699 --> 00:22:37,465
Okay, this is where something
good happens, finally.

532
00:22:37,536 --> 00:22:38,969
So we're going to slow down

533
00:22:39,038 --> 00:22:41,006
and make it last
as long as possible.

534
00:23:15,841 --> 00:23:17,672
( All Gasping )

535
00:23:20,212 --> 00:23:22,339
Dude, you hit a cripple.

536
00:23:24,016 --> 00:23:27,179
( Gasping And Shouting )

537
00:23:27,252 --> 00:23:29,220
I didn't mean to...
I wasn't trying...

538
00:23:29,288 --> 00:23:31,051
Stevie, I'm sorry.

539
00:23:31,123 --> 00:23:33,557
( Stevie Groaning )

540
00:23:33,625 --> 00:23:36,389
Ow...

541
00:23:36,462 --> 00:23:39,260
aah...

542
00:23:39,331 --> 00:23:40,923
ow!

543
00:23:40,999 --> 00:23:42,728
What's your problem?

544
00:23:42,801 --> 00:23:45,235
I mean, he's in a wheelchair
and he has glasses.

545
00:23:54,646 --> 00:23:56,113
So then, the principal comes out

546
00:23:56,181 --> 00:23:58,274
and everyone's
all talking at once.

547
00:23:58,350 --> 00:23:59,749
So the story he puts together

548
00:23:59,818 --> 00:24:01,911
is that Spath attacks Stevie
for his lunch

549
00:24:01,987 --> 00:24:04,353
and I'm like this hero
that stepped in to defend him.

550
00:24:04,423 --> 00:24:06,857
It was beautiful.

551
00:24:06,925 --> 00:24:10,361
Okay, it wasn't funny
when Spath started crying.

552
00:24:10,429 --> 00:24:13,057
No, wait, it was.

553
00:24:14,399 --> 00:24:17,197
Dad's hair... ugh.

554
00:24:17,269 --> 00:24:20,261
Yeah, I know. It's gross.

555
00:24:20,339 --> 00:24:22,273
But, hey, if a bunch of birds

556
00:24:22,341 --> 00:24:24,206
can make the best
out of what they get

557
00:24:24,276 --> 00:24:25,368
then so can I.

558
00:24:25,444 --> 00:24:26,376
Dewey:
Malcolm?

559
00:24:26,445 --> 00:24:28,037
Like having to go to special class.

560
00:24:28,113 --> 00:24:30,206
I can make it work out, right?

561
00:24:30,282 --> 00:24:31,544
Malcolm?

562
00:24:31,617 --> 00:24:32,709
Not now!

563
00:24:32,785 --> 00:24:33,877
Or my family.

564
00:24:33,952 --> 00:24:35,886
We're not the greatest family
in the world

565
00:24:35,954 --> 00:24:37,546
but we can get better.

566
00:24:37,623 --> 00:24:39,090
I mean, it's not impossible.

567
00:24:39,158 --> 00:24:40,090
Malcolm?

568
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:41,217
What?!

569
00:24:41,293 --> 00:24:42,385
Can I get out?

570
00:24:42,461 --> 00:24:43,826
No, stop asking.

571
00:24:43,896 --> 00:24:47,059
So basically, I think
everything's going to be okay.

572
00:24:47,132 --> 00:24:48,224
( Pounding )

573
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:50,234
A bug went up my nose.

574
00:24:50,302 --> 00:24:52,167
So what do you want me to do
about it?



9999
