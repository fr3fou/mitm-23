163
00:07:44,244 --> 00:07:46,007
Now, there's one
question in my mind--

164
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:47,307
Can I trust you?

165
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:48,312
But...

166
00:07:48,381 --> 00:07:49,609
Can I trust you?

167
00:07:49,682 --> 00:07:53,641
Yes. Yeah, definitely.

168
00:07:55,688 --> 00:07:57,781
I'll toss my lunch bag
over the fence before school.

169
00:08:00,226 --> 00:08:02,285
Oh!

170
00:08:02,362 --> 00:08:04,489
Uh!

171
00:08:04,564 --> 00:08:06,964
Mmm!

172
00:08:22,148 --> 00:08:24,616
Can I have some?

173
00:08:24,684 --> 00:08:26,276
Can't.

174
00:08:26,352 --> 00:08:28,081
It's a...

175
00:08:28,154 --> 00:08:30,816
prescription... sandwich.

176
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:32,187
''Prescription sandwich''?

177
00:08:32,258 --> 00:08:34,123
Stevie, that's not even a good lie.

178
00:08:34,194 --> 00:08:36,389
If you don't want to share,
just say so.

179
00:08:36,462 --> 00:08:37,394
Don't want...

180
00:08:37,463 --> 00:08:38,430
to share.

181
00:08:38,498 --> 00:08:41,262
Let's play...

182
00:08:41,334 --> 00:08:42,426
<i>Ironside</i>.

183
00:08:42,502 --> 00:08:44,766
I'll be... Ironside.

184
00:08:44,838 --> 00:08:46,863
I don't want to play
stupid <i>Ironside</i>.

185
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:49,272
What's your... problem?

186
00:08:49,342 --> 00:08:50,639
It's my brother Francis.

187
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:54,168
He escaped from military school
and hitchhiked all the way here.

188
00:08:54,247 --> 00:08:57,148
He's all scraped up
and smelly and hungry and dirty,

189
00:08:57,217 --> 00:08:59,344
and now he's hiding out
at the creek.

190
00:08:59,419 --> 00:09:01,717
If my parents catch him,
he's dead.

191
00:09:01,788 --> 00:09:03,915
He's talking like he's crazy.

192
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:05,753
I don't know what to do.

193
00:09:05,825 --> 00:09:08,385
Squeal.

194
00:09:08,461 --> 00:09:09,553
What?

195
00:09:09,629 --> 00:09:10,823
Squeal.

196
00:09:10,897 --> 00:09:13,024
Rat him out.

197
00:09:13,099 --> 00:09:14,396
I can't do that.

198
00:09:14,467 --> 00:09:15,764
He's my brother.

199
00:09:15,835 --> 00:09:17,063
I promised him.

200
00:09:17,136 --> 00:09:18,899
I can't tell anybody.

201
00:09:18,972 --> 00:09:21,702
You told... me.

202
00:09:21,774 --> 00:09:23,298
Yeah, but by the time
you tell anyone

203
00:09:23,376 --> 00:09:24,866
he'll be a thousand miles from here.

204
00:09:24,944 --> 00:09:28,971
Tou... ché.

205
00:09:31,784 --> 00:09:34,082
Beebee...

206
00:09:34,153 --> 00:09:35,085
What?

207
00:09:35,154 --> 00:09:37,486
Oh, you're that kid.

208
00:09:37,557 --> 00:09:38,751
My name's Malcolm.

209
00:09:38,825 --> 00:09:40,224
I'm Francis's brother.

210
00:09:40,293 --> 00:09:42,158
You met me, like, ten times.

211
00:09:42,228 --> 00:09:45,664
Yeah, you're
the freaky little brain, right?

212
00:09:47,734 --> 00:09:48,666
Just be cool.

213
00:09:48,735 --> 00:09:49,827
What do you want?

214
00:09:49,903 --> 00:09:51,427
Here.

215
00:09:51,504 --> 00:09:52,766
Francis is back home.

216
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:54,898
Well, he's not home.

217
00:09:54,974 --> 00:09:55,668
He's hiding.

218
00:09:55,742 --> 00:09:57,266
Huh. Three pages?

219
00:09:57,343 --> 00:09:58,571
Both sides.

220
00:09:58,645 --> 00:10:01,443
He <i>loves</i> to make me read.

221
00:10:01,514 --> 00:10:03,038
What's that word?

222
00:10:03,116 --> 00:10:04,276
''Consummate.''

223
00:10:05,685 --> 00:10:07,414
It means he likes you.

224
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:10,047
Oh.

225
00:10:11,991 --> 00:10:14,289
''Assignation, rendezvous, tryst''?

226
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:18,126
How the hell is anyone supposed to
know what he's talking about?

227
00:10:18,197 --> 00:10:20,529
Beebee,just meet him
at the creek at <i>7</i>:30, okay?

228
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:24,559
See? You can say it in English,
and you're, like, ten.

229
00:10:24,637 --> 00:10:25,661
What are you doing?

230
00:10:25,738 --> 00:10:26,932
I'm wearing a tank top.

231
00:10:27,006 --> 00:10:28,337
Beebee, I don't think...

232
00:10:28,408 --> 00:10:29,466
Don't think.

233
00:10:29,542 --> 00:10:30,839
Just walk. Go.

234
00:10:42,422 --> 00:10:45,448
The worst part is,
I think I'm stealing panty liners.

235
00:10:46,592 --> 00:10:48,822
Gosh, I had such a good day
at work today.

236
00:10:48,895 --> 00:10:51,864
I got to work the cash-only line
for the first time in a month,

237
00:10:51,931 --> 00:10:53,990
and my register
came out to the penny.

238
00:10:54,067 --> 00:10:56,297
Plus, that creepy
new assistant manager

239
00:10:56,369 --> 00:10:58,496
sliced his hand open
with a box cutter.

240
00:10:58,571 --> 00:11:01,233
Spent the whole afternoon
in the emergency room.

241
00:11:01,307 --> 00:11:03,935
Here's to him.

242
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:06,376
Honey, this chicken
is absolutely delicious.

243
00:11:06,446 --> 00:11:08,914
Oh, well, it's a little recipe
I came up with.

244
00:11:08,982 --> 00:11:10,779
It's Shake 'n' Bake--
but for pork.

245
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:12,784
How about that?

246
00:11:12,852 --> 00:11:16,049
That's one for the recipe box.

247
00:11:16,122 --> 00:11:17,851
Let's call it, uh, ''chork.''

248
00:11:17,924 --> 00:11:19,255
All in favor?

249
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,055
No one for ''picken''?

250
00:11:22,128 --> 00:11:23,152
Chork it is.

251
00:11:23,229 --> 00:11:24,253
Brava.

252
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:26,059
Oh, cut it out.

253
00:11:26,132 --> 00:11:27,895
You big talker.

254
00:11:33,973 --> 00:11:37,238
Will this make me taste better
to the monsters?

255
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:39,005
Sure it will, son.

256
00:11:40,446 --> 00:11:41,640
Get out of here!

257
00:11:41,714 --> 00:11:43,306
You're not eating it.

258

You haven't had a bite
in two minutes.

259
00:11:45,351 --> 00:11:46,443
I'm saving it.

260
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:48,316
There is no saving.

261
00:11:48,388 --> 00:11:49,616
Malcolm, he's right.

262
00:11:49,689 --> 00:11:51,054
The rule is no saving.

263
00:11:52,692 --> 00:11:53,886
Oh, yeah, I care.

264
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,892
Cut it out!

265
00:11:54,961 --> 00:11:56,485
( <i>Phone Ringing</i> )

266
00:11:56,562 --> 00:11:57,688
Come on, it's mine.

267
00:11:57,764 --> 00:11:58,788
Boys, boys, stop it.

268
00:11:58,865 --> 00:12:00,662
You're going get
your mother out of...

269
00:12:00,733 --> 00:12:02,963
You're going to ruin
her nice day.

270
00:12:03,036 --> 00:12:04,367
Francis did what?!

271
00:12:08,074 --> 00:12:11,134
Another night in the chat room.

272
00:12:11,878 --> 00:12:13,436
That kid!

273
00:12:13,513 --> 00:12:17,347
He thinks he can run away from school
like some kind of escaped convict?

274
00:12:17,417 --> 00:12:20,409
If he thinks he can just vanish
in the night and I won't find him,

275
00:12:20,486 --> 00:12:22,420
well, he is sadly mistaken.

276
00:12:22,488 --> 00:12:23,648
Lois, you just calm down.

277
00:12:23,723 --> 00:12:25,714
There's nothing
we can do right now.

278
00:12:25,792 --> 00:12:26,759
Yes, there is.

279
00:12:26,826 --> 00:12:27,986
I can call the police.

280
00:12:28,061 --> 00:12:31,360
They're not going to look for anybody
unless they've been missing 48 hours.

281
00:12:31,431 --> 00:12:33,922
Not if I say he has drugs on him.

282
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,126
Lois, stop it.

283
00:12:35,201 --> 00:12:38,967
You have to accept the fact that,
for now, this is beyond your control.

284
00:12:39,038 --> 00:12:41,563
Francis is going to have
to sink or swim on his own,

285
00:12:41,641 --> 00:12:44,166
and frankly, I don't think
that's such a bad thing.

286
00:12:44,243 --> 00:12:46,905
In the meantime,
we just have to leave it up to fate.

287
00:12:46,979 --> 00:12:48,276
Fate.

288
00:12:48,347 --> 00:12:51,874
Fate is just what you call it
when you don't know the name

289
00:12:51,951 --> 00:12:54,385
of the person screwing you over.

290
00:12:58,624 --> 00:13:01,149
Mom, I'm sure he's okay.

291
00:13:03,029 --> 00:13:05,259
Uh-oh, tactical error.

292
00:13:05,331 --> 00:13:07,424
Why do you think he's okay, son?

293
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,469
Because... he's always okay.

294
00:13:11,804 --> 00:13:15,638
Malcolm, this is a very
serious situation here

295
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:18,643
and I know you love Francis
as much as we do,

296
00:13:18,711 --> 00:13:20,679
so if you have any idea...

297
00:13:20,746 --> 00:13:22,475
Oh, for God's sake!

298
00:13:22,548 --> 00:13:23,537
Where is he?!

299
00:13:23,616 --> 00:13:25,311
He came here to see Beebee.

300
00:13:25,384 --> 00:13:27,011
Oh, my God,
how'd she do that?

301
00:13:27,086 --> 00:13:28,018
I knew it.

302
00:13:28,087 --> 00:13:29,679
When did you talk to him?

303
00:13:29,755 --> 00:13:31,017
Don't look at her eyes.

304
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:32,114
This morning.

305
00:13:32,191 --> 00:13:35,251
And Dewey shoved a sandwich
in the VCR.

306
00:13:35,328 --> 00:13:36,590
Malcolm, where is he?

307
00:13:36,662 --> 00:13:37,856
Got to think.

308
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:38,862
Diversion...

309
00:13:38,931 --> 00:13:39,863
Delancey Park.

310
00:13:39,932 --> 00:13:43,333
He's meeting her at Delancey Park
by the soccer field.

311
00:13:45,371 --> 00:13:47,362
Well...

312
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,399
we'll just see what fate
has in store for Francis.

313
00:14:00,686 --> 00:14:01,948
( <i>Rustling</i> )

314
00:14:02,021 --> 00:14:04,387
Francis, I have to tell you...

315
00:14:04,457 --> 00:14:05,719
Is Beebee coming?

316
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:06,951
Yeah.

317
00:14:07,026 --> 00:14:09,017
But I have to tell
you something first.

318
00:14:09,095 --> 00:14:10,790
I ratted you out to Mom.

319
00:14:10,863 --> 00:14:11,522
What?!

320
00:14:11,597 --> 00:14:12,859
I didn't mean to.

321
00:14:12,932 --> 00:14:14,661
Mom did... her eyes...

322
00:14:14,734 --> 00:14:16,201
and her voice, it was...

323
00:14:16,269 --> 00:14:17,293
I didn't mean to.

324
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:18,860
Malcolm, how could you do that?

325
00:14:18,938 --> 00:14:19,768
I trusted you.

326
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:21,773
I know.

327
00:14:21,841 --> 00:14:23,308

Beebee.

Francis, what's wrong with you?

333
00:14:34,387 --> 00:14:36,378
Why are you getting
in trouble for her?

334

You don't understand.

335
00:14:37,423 --> 00:14:39,550
Duh! No one understands.

336
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:41,320
She's not nice, she's not smart,

337

she's a thief,
she's not even that good-looking.

And, oh, guess what else.

339

She treats you like crap.

Of course I do.

There's something you don't know.

344

What?

345
00:14:56,475 --> 00:14:58,670
That no one in her whole life

346
00:14:58,744 --> 00:15:01,542
has ever loved her
the way that I do.

347

All she has to do is see that,
and everything will change.

Nothing.
Mind your own business.

Who were you talking to?

354

I wasn't talking to anybody.

355
00:15:25,238 --> 00:15:26,398
You're imagining it.

356
00:15:26,472 --> 00:15:27,837
I heard you talking.

357
00:15:29,542 --> 00:15:30,941
Okay, I'll tell you.

You know the monster under your bed?

360
00:15:37,383 --> 00:15:38,645
It's called a Sasquatch.

361
00:15:38,718 --> 00:15:40,242
He hunts back there
during the day.

362
00:15:40,319 --> 00:15:43,345
I was throwing him some raw meat
so he wouldn't come get us tonight.

363
00:15:43,422 --> 00:15:46,016
I don't think I gave him enough.

364
00:15:46,092 --> 00:15:50,256
So, if I were you, I'd keep very quiet
and stay the hell out of there.

you'd call and you'd talk

00:21:20,059 --> 00:21:21,356
before we ask her.

494
00:21:22,661 --> 00:21:25,926
So, how'd it go with Beebee?

495
00:21:25,998 --> 00:21:28,091
We broke up.

496
00:21:29,835 --> 00:21:30,927
Does it hurt?

497
00:21:31,003 --> 00:21:33,836
Oh, yeah.

498
00:21:35,474 --> 00:21:36,702
Well, son...

499
00:21:36,775 --> 00:21:40,142
I wish I could say it gets easier,

500
00:21:40,212 --> 00:21:43,204
but I honestly don't know.

501
00:21:43,282 --> 00:21:45,648
I've never been dumped.

502
00:21:47,586 --> 00:21:50,919
? Don't cry... ?



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
