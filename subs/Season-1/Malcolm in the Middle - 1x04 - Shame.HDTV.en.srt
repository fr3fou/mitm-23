if you're seven.

172
00:07:13,913 --> 00:07:15,710
Why are you seven?

173
00:07:15,782 --> 00:07:17,977
You beat up a seven-year-old?

174
00:07:18,051 --> 00:07:19,313
I didn't know.

175
00:07:19,385 --> 00:07:21,683
Malcolm, I don't blame you.

176
00:07:21,755 --> 00:07:25,247
I put this squarely
where it belongs.

177
00:07:25,325 --> 00:07:27,156
On me.

178
00:07:27,227 --> 00:07:30,094
Oh, man, this is the most
horrible thing I've ever done.

179
00:07:30,163 --> 00:07:31,425
Kevin, I'm sorry.

180
00:07:31,498 --> 00:07:32,863
I think you've done quite enough.

181
00:07:34,067 --> 00:07:35,864
This is the worst birthday ever!

182
00:07:45,011 --> 00:07:47,138
''Inappropriate...

183
00:07:47,213 --> 00:07:48,145
vicious.''

184
00:07:48,214 --> 00:07:49,841
Oh, wait-- ''Thug.''

185
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:51,543
Dude, I have never
gotten ''thug'' before.

186
00:07:51,618 --> 00:07:52,585
That's like the Oscar.

187
00:07:52,652 --> 00:07:54,142
Susie Gunther ate my crayons.

188
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:56,085
Can you beat her up tomorrow?

189
00:07:56,156 --> 00:07:57,214
Leave me alone.

190
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:58,689
You know what
my favorite part is?

191
00:07:58,758 --> 00:08:00,089
It's when you pound on someone

192
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,252
and then a day later

193
00:08:01,327 --> 00:08:02,851
you still feel the pain
in your knuckles.

194
00:08:02,929 --> 00:08:04,328
Oh, I love that.

195
00:08:04,397 --> 00:08:05,864
Shut up, Reese.

196
00:08:05,932 --> 00:08:08,127
Hey, hey,
pace yourself, killer.

197
00:08:08,201 --> 00:08:09,691
<i>( Chain Saw Buzzing )</i>

198
00:08:09,769 --> 00:08:10,997
Whoa.

199
00:08:12,205 --> 00:08:14,230
Whoo-hoo!

200
00:08:14,307 --> 00:08:15,501
Dad.

201
00:08:15,575 --> 00:08:18,373
You cut down the tree
and we missed it?

202
00:08:18,444 --> 00:08:20,378
Oh, baby, you missed it,
all right.

203
00:08:20,446 --> 00:08:22,607
I was about two-thirds
of the way through her

204
00:08:22,682 --> 00:08:25,913
then crack! Kaboom!

205
00:08:25,985 --> 00:08:27,452
My chain saw goes flying.

206
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,112
All the car alarms go off.

207
00:08:29,189 --> 00:08:32,283
About 1 00 squirrels came
boiling out of the branches.

208
00:08:32,358 --> 00:08:34,849
Then a pack of dogs
came out of nowhere

209
00:08:34,928 --> 00:08:36,225
and chased them all over.

210
00:08:36,296 --> 00:08:38,821
Man, I've never seen
anything like it.

211
00:08:38,898 --> 00:08:40,024
Man...

212
00:08:40,099 --> 00:08:41,566
Oh, don't worry, son.

213
00:08:41,634 --> 00:08:43,192
You'll get to share
in the best part.

214
00:08:43,269 --> 00:08:44,327
Cleaning up.

215
00:08:45,805 --> 00:08:47,033
I think you'll enjoy

216
00:08:47,106 --> 00:08:49,233
my sexual awareness lecture
next week.

217
00:08:49,309 --> 00:08:50,401
It's been called riveting.

218
00:08:50,476 --> 00:08:52,000
I'm sure it is, sir.

219
00:08:52,078 --> 00:08:53,739
It sure worked wonders
for me, sir.

220
00:08:53,813 --> 00:08:55,041
The only woman I can think of

221
00:08:55,114 --> 00:08:57,139
without vomiting
is my own mother.

222
00:08:57,217 --> 00:08:59,344
As it should be, son,
as it should be.

223
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,682
He's giving that same lecture

224
00:09:01,754 --> 00:09:03,517
to the underclassmen.

225
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:06,150
I can't let that happen.

226
00:09:06,226 --> 00:09:07,818
I'm stealing his slides.

227
00:09:07,894 --> 00:09:09,623
And to you that's a good idea?

228
00:09:09,696 --> 00:09:10,788
Absolutely.

229
00:09:10,864 --> 00:09:13,833
I know it's hard core, Stanley

230
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,765
but I'm not doing this for me.

231
00:09:15,835 --> 00:09:17,268
I'm doing it for them.

232
00:09:17,337 --> 00:09:19,396
After all,
they are the future.

233
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:23,733
Francis,
I don't know why you assume

234
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:25,937
we'll be able to just walk
into Spangler's office

235
00:09:26,012 --> 00:09:27,206
and find the sex slides.

236
00:09:29,048 --> 00:09:32,347
Oh, man, I wish all my break-ins
were this easy.

237
00:09:36,823 --> 00:09:37,847
Okay, I got 'em.

238
00:09:37,924 --> 00:09:38,856
Let's get out of here.

239
00:09:38,925 --> 00:09:39,949
Wait a second.

240
00:09:44,297 --> 00:09:47,198
Oh, my God,
this is a gold mine.

241
00:09:47,267 --> 00:09:49,701
Spangler drinking...

242
00:09:49,769 --> 00:09:52,499
Spangler kissing...

243
00:09:52,572 --> 00:09:55,200
Spangler in a Speedo?

244
00:09:55,275 --> 00:09:56,264
Spangler out of a Speedo.

245
00:09:56,342 --> 00:09:57,366
All right, that's enough.

246
00:09:57,443 --> 00:09:58,375
Let's leave, huh?

247
00:09:58,444 --> 00:09:59,376
Wait a second.

248
00:09:59,445 --> 00:10:01,106
I have an idea.

249
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:03,648
I'm going to make Spangler's
sexual awareness lecture

250
00:10:03,716 --> 00:10:04,944
just a little more interesting.

251
00:10:05,018 --> 00:10:06,679
You do realize
what he'll do to you

252
00:10:06,753 --> 00:10:08,345
if you humiliate him
like this, right?

253
00:10:08,421 --> 00:10:10,685
And yet, I'm doing it anyway.

254
00:10:10,757 --> 00:10:12,748
Weird, huh?

255
00:10:12,825 --> 00:10:15,225
Why are the eggs so little?

256
00:10:15,295 --> 00:10:16,819
They're robin's eggs
from the tree

257
00:10:16,896 --> 00:10:17,988
your father cut down.

258
00:10:18,965 --> 00:10:20,432
Paul Bunyan.

259
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,365
That's nature for you.

260
00:10:22,435 --> 00:10:24,426
1 00 years to grow,
1 2 minutes to cut down.

261
00:10:24,504 --> 00:10:26,233
There's got to be a lesson
in there somewhere.

262
00:10:26,306 --> 00:10:27,295
It is nice

263
00:10:27,373 --> 00:10:28,897
having this extra light
in the room.

264
00:10:28,975 --> 00:10:31,034
Wait till I bring
in the wood chipper.

265
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:32,839
Then you're really
going to see something.

266
00:10:32,912 --> 00:10:34,402
I can't take this anymore.

267
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,243
When are you going to punish me?

268
00:10:36,316 --> 00:10:37,374
For what?

269
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:38,781
For beating up a seven-year-old.

270
00:10:38,851 --> 00:10:40,910
<i>( All Laughing )</i>

271
00:10:42,789 --> 00:10:43,949
Oh, my God, that's right.

272
00:10:44,023 --> 00:10:45,490
You must've just felt ridiculous

273
00:10:45,558 --> 00:10:47,423
when you found out
how old that kid was.

274
00:10:47,493 --> 00:10:49,757
I can only imagine
the look on your face.

275
00:10:49,829 --> 00:10:51,353
<i>( Laughing )</i>

276
00:10:51,431 --> 00:10:53,092

277
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:54,463
I'll get it.

278
00:10:54,534 --> 00:10:55,660
Oh, this is nice.

279
00:10:55,735 --> 00:10:57,464
We should start every day
with a good laugh.

280
00:10:57,537 --> 00:10:59,471
It's not funny.

281
00:10:59,539 --> 00:11:00,471
It's awful.

282
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,871
I did something horrible.

283
00:11:01,941 --> 00:11:03,340
Don't you even care?

284
00:11:03,409 --> 00:11:05,036
Well, it's nothing
to be proud of, son

285
00:11:05,111 --> 00:11:06,908
but you told us the whole story

286
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,743
and he didn't give you
much choice.

287
00:11:08,815 --> 00:11:10,510
It was an honest beating mistake.

288
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:12,881
Besides, it sends
a good message to our enemies.

289
00:11:12,952 --> 00:11:14,180
What are you talking about?

290
00:11:14,253 --> 00:11:15,185
What enemies?

291
00:11:15,254 --> 00:11:17,154
Oh, they're out there.

292
00:11:17,223 --> 00:11:19,748
And once they know
we're capable of this

293
00:11:19,826 --> 00:11:21,521
they'll know we're capable
of anything.

294
00:11:24,397 --> 00:11:27,161
Okay, so it's not just me, right?

295
00:11:27,233 --> 00:11:29,360
There's something seriously
wrong with this family.

296
00:11:29,435 --> 00:11:31,062
Lois:
It's none of your business

297
00:11:31,137 --> 00:11:33,071
what we do on our property.

298
00:11:33,139 --> 00:11:34,731
Ed: That tree was older
than your house.

299
00:11:34,807 --> 00:11:36,206
You had no right to cut it down.

300
00:11:36,275 --> 00:11:37,401
We're a neighborhood.

301
00:11:37,477 --> 00:11:38,444
And removing trees

302
00:11:38,511 --> 00:11:40,274
is a neighborhood decision.

303
00:11:40,346 --> 00:11:41,574
Oh, you people.

304
00:11:41,647 --> 00:11:43,410
For 1 5 years,
you mowed your lawns at night

305
00:11:43,483 --> 00:11:44,780
so you don't have to talk to us.

306
00:11:44,851 --> 00:11:46,614
Now, all of a sudden
we're a neighborhood?

307
00:11:46,686 --> 00:11:47,880
What's going on here?

308
00:11:47,954 --> 00:11:50,946
You've caused a blight
by cutting down that tree.

309
00:11:51,024 --> 00:11:52,787
How is cutting down
a tree a blight?

310
00:11:52,859 --> 00:11:54,383
Because now we can
see your house.

311
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:57,122
Lois: Well, let me
tell you something, Ed.

312
00:11:57,196 --> 00:11:58,220
As far as I'm concerned

313
00:11:58,297 --> 00:11:59,730
you and the neighbors
can all just...

315
00:12:01,501 --> 00:12:02,798
That goes double for me.

316
00:12:02,869 --> 00:12:04,564
I want you all
off our property now or...

317

00:12:22,021 --> 00:12:23,488
How can they act like this?

324
00:12:29,028 --> 00:12:31,087
Then I found out
he was only seven.

325
00:12:31,164 --> 00:12:32,654
I didn't know what to do.

326
00:12:32,732 --> 00:12:34,359
I felt like
I had to talk to someone.

327
00:12:34,434 --> 00:12:36,368
I hope I'm doing this right.

328
00:12:36,436 --> 00:12:39,234
See, my family--
we're not like regular churchgoers

329
00:12:39,305 --> 00:12:40,602
but I know places like this

330
00:12:40,673 --> 00:12:42,504
are supposed
to help you feel better

331
00:12:42,575 --> 00:12:43,940
and that's really what I need.

332
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:45,500
I did something terrible, and...

333
00:12:45,578 --> 00:12:48,012
now I just feel like there's

00:20:27,773 --> 00:20:29,536
Remember, son

500
00:20:29,608 --> 00:20:32,168
a good soldier
always checks the chamber.

501
00:20:35,681 --> 00:20:38,479
Okay, this is going to sting.

502
00:20:40,819 --> 00:20:43,014
What is with you?

503
00:20:43,088 --> 00:20:44,612
Nothing.

504
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:46,590
Usually you scream
like a stuck pig

505
00:20:46,659 --> 00:20:48,092
when I put this stuff on.

506
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,025
You've been such a zombie lately.

507
00:20:50,095 --> 00:20:53,462
It feels worse on the inside
than it does on my knee.

508
00:20:53,532 --> 00:20:55,830
What are you talking about?

509
00:20:55,901 --> 00:20:59,803
Mom, I can't stop feeling bad
about what I did to Kevin.

510
00:20:59,872 --> 00:21:02,773
I feel like I have a monster
inside of me.

511
00:21:04,677 --> 00:21:06,872
Oh, for crying out loud, Malcolm

512
00:21:06,946 --> 00:21:08,208
that's no monster.

513
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,907
That's your conscience.

514
00:21:09,982 --> 00:21:12,815
You should be thankful
God gave you one.

515
00:21:12,885 --> 00:21:14,250
Yeah. It feels great.

516
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,412
I'm serious.

517
00:21:15,487 --> 00:21:16,613
It's a gift.

518
00:21:16,689 --> 00:21:18,987
And you know what
most people do with theirs?

519
00:21:19,058 --> 00:21:20,025
They keep them in the closet

520
00:21:20,092 --> 00:21:21,184
and bring them out

521
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,818
only when they think
he's coming to visit.

522
00:21:22,895 --> 00:21:24,920
You're not like that.

523
00:21:24,997 --> 00:21:26,225
Good for you.

524
00:21:26,298 --> 00:21:27,925
But I can't stop
thinking about it.

525
00:21:29,201 --> 00:21:30,225
Ow!

526
00:21:30,302 --> 00:21:32,736
Were you thinking
about it just then?

527
00:21:32,805 --> 00:21:33,533
No!

528
00:21:33,606 --> 00:21:34,766
See? I promise

529
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,398
you will feel bad about Kevin

530
00:21:36,475 --> 00:21:38,375
only as long
as you're supposed to.

531
00:21:38,444 --> 00:21:41,379
Now, go to bed.

532
00:21:41,447 --> 00:21:43,347
You're a nice boy, Malcolm

533
00:21:43,415 --> 00:21:44,780
and I'll kick the conniption

534
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:46,511
out of anybody
who says you aren't

535
00:21:46,585 --> 00:21:48,678
including that little voice
in your head.

536
00:21:50,189 --> 00:21:51,884
Okay.

537
00:21:51,957 --> 00:21:52,981
Good night, Mom.

538
00:21:53,058 --> 00:21:54,150
Good night, sweetie.

539
00:21:54,226 --> 00:21:55,250
Night, Dad.

540
00:21:55,327 --> 00:21:57,818
Good night, son.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
