160
00:08:19,713 --> 00:08:22,147
we have had our share of conflicts.

161
00:08:22,216 --> 00:08:27,244
In all my efforts to get through to you
I have tried every method I know how.

162
00:08:27,321 --> 00:08:29,755
And besides mental
and physical abuse, sir,

163
00:08:29,823 --> 00:08:31,484
exactly which methods
would those be?

164
00:08:31,558 --> 00:08:36,586
This photo made me realize something.

165
00:08:36,664 --> 00:08:38,689
I used to be like you.

166
00:08:38,766 --> 00:08:41,326
Insolent, arrogant, cavalier.

167
00:08:41,402 --> 00:08:43,063
- Sir, I...
- Floor.

168
00:08:44,271 --> 00:08:48,605
Now, son,
you are on the precipice.

169
00:08:54,315 --> 00:08:58,149
Now, I am going to tell you
a story about my life

170
00:08:58,218 --> 00:09:01,312
in the hopes of finally getting you
to straighten yourself out.

171
00:09:01,388 --> 00:09:02,753
In the coming hours,

172
00:09:02,823 --> 00:09:05,383
you are going to hear things
that are going to horrify you.

173
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:07,950
It sounds illuminating, sir,
but I have biology.

174
00:09:08,028 --> 00:09:11,691
I've taken the liberty
of canceling your next three classes.

175
00:09:12,966 --> 00:09:17,027
Son, do you know
what a wet nurse is?

176
00:09:34,822 --> 00:09:37,950
Dewey, have you forgotten me?
I thought we were friends.

177
00:09:38,025 --> 00:09:41,984
All of the boys and girls
on your street are my friends.

178
00:09:42,062 --> 00:09:45,589
They all bought me.
Your parents have lots of money.

179
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:47,065
They're just hiding it.

180
00:09:47,134 --> 00:09:51,002
But I don't want you to buy me for me.
It's for your own good.

181
00:09:51,071 --> 00:09:55,474
I didn't want to tell you this,
but if you don't buy me, you'll die.

182
00:09:57,311 --> 00:09:59,836
Honestly, Hal, I don't know
what's wrong with Reese.

183
00:09:59,913 --> 00:10:01,210
Oh, he's just a little slow.

184
00:10:01,281 --> 00:10:03,010
No. I mean the way
he's been acting.

185
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:04,983
Hey, Mom, where's the iron?

186
00:10:05,052 --> 00:10:06,041
Ah.

187
00:10:08,055 --> 00:10:09,920
- It's a girl.
- It's a girl.

188
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:11,821
Hal, it's time for the talk.

189
00:10:11,892 --> 00:10:13,689
I don't know what you mean.

190
00:10:13,761 --> 00:10:15,160
The talk, Hal.

191
00:10:15,229 --> 00:10:17,356
Oh, geez, he's a little young,
don't you think?

192
00:10:17,431 --> 00:10:20,059
You waited so long with Francis;
look what happened there.

193
00:10:20,134 --> 00:10:22,068
All right,
but if I'm giving the talk,

194
00:10:22,136 --> 00:10:24,070
all three boys
are getting it at the same time.

195
00:10:24,138 --> 00:10:25,298
And I'm not doing it again.

196
00:10:25,372 --> 00:10:27,636
So if we have any more kids,
they're on their own.

197
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:31,471
Mom? Dad?

198
00:10:31,545 --> 00:10:33,308
I'd really like a Herbie doll.

199
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:36,247
I know it's expensive,
but I don't ask for a lot.

200
00:10:36,316 --> 00:10:38,113
And I've been very good lately.

201
00:10:38,185 --> 00:10:41,120
I want it! I want it!
I want it! I want it!

202
00:10:41,188 --> 00:10:43,520
I want it! I want it! I want it!

203
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:45,148
Looks like he found the sugar.

204
00:10:45,225 --> 00:10:47,853
Oh, doesn't he look just
like a little dust mop?

205
00:10:47,928 --> 00:10:48,860
<i>Ready?</i>

206
00:10:48,929 --> 00:10:49,861
Hit it.

207
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:53,559
B-E A-G-G-R-E-S-S-I-V-E!

208
00:10:53,634 --> 00:10:56,728
B-E A-G-G-R-E-S-S-I-V-E!

209
00:10:56,804 --> 00:10:58,362
( <i>Clapping</i> )

210
00:10:58,439 --> 00:11:00,066
What's that spell?

211
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:01,038
Be aggressive!

212
00:11:01,108 --> 00:11:02,871
B-E aggressive!

213
00:11:02,943 --> 00:11:04,001
V-I-C-T-O-R-Y.

214
00:11:05,112 --> 00:11:07,546
That's the Wildcats' battle cry.

215
00:11:07,614 --> 00:11:09,673
What a... geek.

216
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,650
I never thought...

217
00:11:11,718 --> 00:11:13,549
I'd get... to say that.

218
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:14,848
Oh, my God.

219
00:11:14,922 --> 00:11:17,288
I'm a Krelboyne with a brother
who's a cheerleader.

220
00:11:17,357 --> 00:11:20,724
I can wet my pants in public
and it would be a lateral move.

221
00:11:20,794 --> 00:11:22,591
...O-R-Y.

222
00:11:22,663 --> 00:11:23,960
That's the Wildcats' battle cry.

223
00:11:25,165 --> 00:11:26,189
Success!

224
00:11:26,266 --> 00:11:27,358
Victory... success!

225
00:11:27,434 --> 00:11:29,698
Victory, yes!

226
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:32,102
Ow!

227
00:11:32,172 --> 00:11:34,231
So clumsy.

228
00:11:34,308 --> 00:11:35,570
Hey, Malcolm.

229
00:11:35,642 --> 00:11:38,805
You think your brother
will lend me his corset?

230
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:41,712
When a Krelboyne makes fun of you,
you know you're in trouble.

231
00:11:41,782 --> 00:11:43,716
See, that comment
was playing off the concept

232
00:11:43,784 --> 00:11:48,118
that we all have specific notions
of gender-appropriate roles.

233
00:11:48,188 --> 00:11:49,951
At least they're no good at it.

234
00:11:50,023 --> 00:11:53,515
So there we were--
the ocean, my stepfather and me.

235
00:11:53,594 --> 00:11:55,562
As the storm raged overhead,

236
00:11:55,629 --> 00:11:58,393
he made one final lunge
for the rudder.

237
00:11:58,465 --> 00:12:01,866
I ripped it from his hands
and stared him down.

238
00:12:01,935 --> 00:12:04,927
He knew that
I was prepared to kill him.

239
00:12:05,005 --> 00:12:09,203
I left port that day
a 1 6-year-old boy.

240
00:12:09,276 --> 00:12:11,210
I returned a man.

241
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,314
That was an amazing story, sir.

242
00:12:15,382 --> 00:12:17,509
I mean, I was skeptical at first,

243
00:12:17,584 --> 00:12:19,950
but we do have something in common.

244
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:23,717
I mean, look at the way
both our mothers abandoned us.

245
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:25,621
What are you talking about?

246
00:12:25,692 --> 00:12:29,389
You know, how I was shipped off here
and you were left with your wet nurse.

247
00:12:29,463 --> 00:12:32,762
That story had nothing to do
with my mother.

248
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:38,135
It had to do with me finally taking
responsibility for my own actions.

249
00:12:38,205 --> 00:12:40,799
Just sounded like she may
have been a little bit distant.

250
00:12:40,874 --> 00:12:43,069
Well, that is none of your business.

251
00:12:43,143 --> 00:12:46,078
I swear, you are absolutely
fixated on mothers.

252
00:12:46,146 --> 00:12:47,511
I am not fixated.

253
00:12:47,581 --> 00:12:50,744
Can you name one thing in your life
that you don't blame on your mother?

254
00:12:50,817 --> 00:12:52,478
Sure.

255
00:12:55,422 --> 00:12:58,414
I'm sorry.
I was just giving an opinion.

256
00:12:58,492 --> 00:13:01,518
Well, it's that pop psychology
nonsense that...

257
00:13:01,595 --> 00:13:03,790
It is nothing to get
defensive about.

258
00:13:03,864 --> 00:13:05,456
I am not defensive.

259
00:13:05,532 --> 00:13:10,333
Every time anybody denies a lie,
they're called defensive.

260
00:13:10,404 --> 00:13:12,338
Fine. I take it back.
Your mother was a saint.

261
00:13:12,406 --> 00:13:14,340
I am not saying that at all.

262
00:13:15,943 --> 00:13:17,808
Does this look anything like a ''Q''?

263
00:13:17,878 --> 00:13:20,642
Reese,just stop this.
You're acting like a moron.

264
00:13:20,714 --> 00:13:22,614
And you're making
no progress with Wendy.

265
00:13:22,683 --> 00:13:25,049
And what the hell
do you need a ''Q'' for anyway?

266
00:13:25,118 --> 00:13:27,177
You're right. I'm terrible.

267
00:13:27,254 --> 00:13:29,848
I'm just not coordinated
unless I'm hitting somebody.

268
00:13:29,923 --> 00:13:31,891
But I really like her.

269
00:13:31,959 --> 00:13:33,756
I have to get good.

270
00:13:33,827 --> 00:13:37,729
Listen to the words.
Good. Boy. Cheerleader.

271
00:13:37,798 --> 00:13:40,995
-Quit while you still have some dignity.
-Oh, and let her think I'm a quitter?

272
00:13:41,068 --> 00:13:43,798
You can't even remember
a simple six-step routine.

273
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:46,304
There's six steps?

274
00:13:46,373 --> 00:13:50,002
Yes. It's just right, left,
right, left, reverse, pose.

275
00:13:50,077 --> 00:13:52,204
You remember that from just watching?

276
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:54,975
You guys did it, like, ten times.

277
00:13:55,048 --> 00:13:57,380
So... you know my routine?

278
00:13:57,451 --> 00:13:59,078
It's not that hard.

279
00:13:59,152 --> 00:14:01,985
- But... you know my routine.
- Yes, I do.

280
00:14:02,055 --> 00:14:03,818
Look, I know where this is going...

281
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:06,324
No, you don't.
You're going to help me.

282
00:14:06,393 --> 00:14:09,191
- That <i>is</i> where I was going.
- Oh. Good. Let's get started.

283
00:14:09,262 --> 00:14:11,230
- No!
- Come on! You have to!

284
00:14:11,298 --> 00:14:13,698
No. Don't you know how embarrassing
that could be for me?

285
00:14:13,767 --> 00:14:16,065
- I know what's more embarrassing.
- What?

286
00:14:16,136 --> 00:14:19,833
Getting beaten into a coma
by a good boy cheerleader.

287
00:14:19,906 --> 00:14:23,501
Spangler: My mother was
neither a madonna or a whore!

288
00:14:23,577 --> 00:14:26,068
She was a damn fine woman.

289
00:14:26,146 --> 00:14:28,706
Stick your arms out!
We have to sell this!

290
00:14:28,782 --> 00:14:31,250
Can you move your hand
a little to the left?

291
00:14:31,318 --> 00:14:32,945
Reese:
Spread your legs!

292
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:33,987
Malcolm:
No!

293
00:14:34,054 --> 00:14:35,316
Reese:
I said spread your legs!

294
00:14:35,389 --> 00:14:36,321
Malcolm:
No!

295
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:39,325
It's time for the talk, Hal.

296
00:14:39,393 --> 00:14:41,020
Malcolm:
I'm not spreading my legs!

297
00:14:42,696 --> 00:14:43,890
Fight, fight, fight!

298
00:14:43,964 --> 00:14:46,660
Fight harder, Wildcats!
Help us out! Fight!

299
00:14:46,733 --> 00:14:48,030
Fight, fight, fight!

300
00:14:48,101 --> 00:14:49,796
Fight harder, Wildcats!

301
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:51,167
Help us out! Fight!

302
00:14:51,238 --> 00:14:53,035
We got spirit!

303
00:14:53,106 --> 00:14:54,539
Wildcats, we got spirit!

304
00:14:54,608 --> 00:14:55,870
Wildcats, we got what?

305
00:14:55,942 --> 00:14:57,136
What, what, what, what?

306
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:59,371
What, what, what,
what, what, what, what?

307
00:14:59,446 --> 00:15:00,378
We got spirit!

308
00:15:00,447 --> 00:15:02,415
Wildcats, we got spirit!

309
00:15:02,482 --> 00:15:03,676
Wildcats, we got what?

310
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,047
What, what, what, what?

311
00:15:05,118 --> 00:15:07,313
What, what, what,
what, what, what, what?

312
00:15:07,387 --> 00:15:09,048
We got spirit! Whoo!

313
00:15:09,122 --> 00:15:11,682
Yes!

314
00:15:11,758 --> 00:15:12,554
Yes.

315
00:15:14,561 --> 00:15:15,892
Reese, that was incredible.

Now, unfortunately,
if the boy is from our family

it goes a little more like this:
