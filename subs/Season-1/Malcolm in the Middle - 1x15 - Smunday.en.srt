Cool.

169
00:07:04,177 --> 00:07:06,543
Oh, dude, I need you to do me
a giant favor.

170
00:07:06,613 --> 00:07:07,580
Go check the mail.

171
00:07:07,648 --> 00:07:09,639
There should be a letter there

172
00:07:09,716 --> 00:07:11,581
from Southern Alabama State.

173
00:07:11,652 --> 00:07:13,552
Yeah, it's here.

174
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,645
Why, did you apply there?

175
00:07:15,722 --> 00:07:17,815
No, it's probably no point
in me ever trying to.

176
00:07:17,891 --> 00:07:20,257
I kind of drove a backhoe
into their swimming pool.

177
00:07:20,327 --> 00:07:21,419
Oh, man.

178
00:07:21,495 --> 00:07:23,360
Did they have to drain the pool?

179
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:26,126
No, if you put a ten-foot crack
in them, they drain themselves.

180
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:27,598
They did have to drain the gym.

181
00:07:27,668 --> 00:07:29,033
Ooh.

182
00:07:29,102 --> 00:07:31,002
But I have a plan--
I want you to take the letter

183
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:32,402
and hide it.

184
00:07:32,472 --> 00:07:33,837
Okay, and then what?

185
00:07:33,907 --> 00:07:34,999
And then...

186
00:07:35,075 --> 00:07:36,736
I'll come up
with an idea later.

187
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:38,334
That's all I got so far.

188
00:07:38,412 --> 00:07:40,107
Yeah, we're kind of
in the same boat.

189
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:42,239
We're stuck in the house
with nothing to do.

190
00:07:42,315 --> 00:07:44,044
You should go
to the arcade on Hillcrest.

191
00:07:44,117 --> 00:07:46,312
The manager there
has an enlightened outlook

192
00:07:46,386 --> 00:07:48,354
on a kid's right to choose
his own school hours.

193
00:07:48,422 --> 00:07:49,946
We don't have any money, though.

194
00:07:50,023 --> 00:07:52,014
All right, you guys
are doing me a favor

195
00:07:52,092 --> 00:07:54,026
so I'll let you in
on a little secret.

196
00:07:54,094 --> 00:07:55,220
Mom keeps some money

197
00:07:55,295 --> 00:07:57,024
in the top left drawer
of her dresser

198
00:07:57,097 --> 00:07:58,291
but she won't notice

199
00:07:58,365 --> 00:08:00,663
if you only take
between five and seven dollars.

200
00:08:09,209 --> 00:08:10,642
What are you boys doing?

201
00:08:10,711 --> 00:08:12,508
Looking for your money.

202
00:08:12,579 --> 00:08:13,705
It's not there.

203
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:15,805
I moved it
to the back of the closet.

204
00:08:15,882 --> 00:08:18,442
Where she hides
our Christmas presents?

205
00:08:18,518 --> 00:08:19,746
No...

206
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:22,220
I moved those to the attic.

207
00:08:26,927 --> 00:08:29,521
Um, Mom, where'd you hide
that football

208
00:08:29,596 --> 00:08:31,188
I broke the window with?

209
00:08:31,264 --> 00:08:32,561
In the garage.

210
00:08:32,632 --> 00:08:35,624
And when you made
chipped beef on toast last week

211
00:08:35,702 --> 00:08:37,033
was that really beef?

212
00:08:37,104 --> 00:08:38,128
Who knows?

213
00:08:38,205 --> 00:08:40,571
It was 39 cents a pound.

214
00:08:42,542 --> 00:08:45,670
Did Grandpa really
punch Jimmy Carter in the face?

215
00:08:45,746 --> 00:08:49,238
No, he just threw a rock
at the motorcade and ran off.

216
00:08:49,316 --> 00:08:51,614
Did you really give
my red blanket to the poor kids?

217
00:08:51,685 --> 00:08:55,314
No, your father used it
to clean the barbecue.

218
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:57,957
I was really adopted,
wasn't I?

219
00:08:58,024 --> 00:09:02,552
Oh, you're ours...
and we love you.

220
00:09:02,629 --> 00:09:03,789
Damn.

221
00:09:06,266 --> 00:09:07,927
So, um...

222
00:09:08,001 --> 00:09:10,128
I don't know.

223
00:09:10,203 --> 00:09:11,261
What's your favorite color?

224
00:09:11,338 --> 00:09:14,830
For the third time, green.

225
00:09:14,908 --> 00:09:16,239
Let's just go.

226
00:09:16,309 --> 00:09:18,300
Wait.

227
00:09:18,378 --> 00:09:20,243
I got a good one.

228
00:09:20,313 --> 00:09:23,441
How'd you know Dewey's bike
wasn't really stolen?

229
00:09:23,517 --> 00:09:24,779
That is a good one.

230
00:09:26,419 --> 00:09:28,444
Francis told me.

231
00:09:36,863 --> 00:09:37,921
I can't believe it!

232
00:09:37,998 --> 00:09:39,465
Francis ratted on us
to Mom!

233
00:09:39,533 --> 00:09:40,500
No!

234
00:09:40,567 --> 00:09:43,058
He wouldn't do that.
You did it!

235
00:09:43,136 --> 00:09:44,694
Shut up!
He sold us out!

236
00:09:44,771 --> 00:09:46,500
Francis is dead to us now!

237
00:09:46,573 --> 00:09:48,666
Wait a minute--

238
00:09:48,742 --> 00:09:50,676
That makes me the oldest brother.

239
00:09:50,744 --> 00:09:51,904
Guys, seriously--

240
00:09:51,978 --> 00:09:54,640
If you have any problems,
you can come to me.

241
00:09:54,714 --> 00:09:55,840
Dewey, get me some iced tea.

242
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:56,746
No!

243
00:09:58,318 --> 00:10:00,343
We should just give this to Mom
and let him fry.

244
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:01,148
Right.

245
00:10:01,221 --> 00:10:02,188
No, wait!

246
00:10:02,255 --> 00:10:03,688
It's Francis.

247
00:10:03,757 --> 00:10:06,055
We can't just take
Mom's word for it.

248
00:10:06,126 --> 00:10:08,185
Hey, Malcolm, everything okay?

249
00:10:08,261 --> 00:10:09,888
Um, Francis...

250
00:10:09,963 --> 00:10:11,897
we were just wondering...

251
00:10:11,965 --> 00:10:13,728
Mom said...

252
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,462
you ratted on us
about Dewey's bike.

253
00:10:16,536 --> 00:10:19,562
But she's probably
just mixed up, right?

254
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:22,073
Because you're our big brother
and you wouldn't do

255
00:10:22,142 --> 00:10:23,871
something like that--
Francis?

256
00:10:23,944 --> 00:10:25,036
You don't know

257
00:10:25,111 --> 00:10:26,806
what kind of pressure
I was under!

258
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,847
You butt-wipe!

259
00:10:27,914 --> 00:10:28,903
How could you?

260
00:10:28,982 --> 00:10:30,244
Well, did he do it?

261
00:10:30,317 --> 00:10:31,409
I can't believe you!

262
00:10:31,484 --> 00:10:32,678
You're our big brother!

263
00:10:32,752 --> 00:10:34,743
You're supposed to protect us,
not betray us.

264
00:10:34,821 --> 00:10:36,254
He did it, didn't he?

265
00:10:36,323 --> 00:10:37,347
Malcolm, let me explain...

266
00:10:37,424 --> 00:10:38,652
And then you actually

267
00:10:38,725 --> 00:10:41,091
have the nerve to ask us
to risk our butts for you?

268
00:10:41,161 --> 00:10:43,459
Maybe we should just
give the letter to Mom.

269
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:45,930
- No, you can't do that!
- Yeah, why not?

270
00:10:45,999 --> 00:10:48,058
Because if you give
the letter to Mom

271
00:10:48,134 --> 00:10:49,726
she'll know it's not Sunday.

272
00:10:49,803 --> 00:10:52,738
I'll just tell her
it came special delivery.

273
00:10:52,806 --> 00:10:54,637
Yeah, well, she won't believe it

274
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:56,835
'cause she would
have to sign for it.

275
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:58,502
I could forge
her signature.

276
00:10:58,578 --> 00:11:00,671
But then she'll know
you can forge her signature.

277
00:11:00,747 --> 00:11:01,873
Which won't matter at all

278
00:11:01,948 --> 00:11:03,415
because she'll be so mad at you

279
00:11:03,483 --> 00:11:05,678
she won't even think
about me for a few days.

280
00:11:05,752 --> 00:11:07,310
And even if she does,
I'll just tell her

281
00:11:07,387 --> 00:11:08,513
I didn't want to disturb her.

282
00:11:08,588 --> 00:11:10,078
So in addition to
you getting nailed

283
00:11:10,156 --> 00:11:11,714
I'll get points for
being sympathetic.

- Think about it--

Every time she gets mad

504
00:18:59,525 --> 00:19:01,720
she forgets about
everything else in the world

505

except for things she's mad at.

506
00:19:03,363 --> 00:19:05,024
That focus is the key to her power.

So?

about sending Francis
to a work farm

at someone else, like at us.

We can do that.

We're going to have to get
in real trouble

more trouble than we've ever
been in, in our entire lives.

And we can't make it look like
we're doing it on purpose.

Yeah.

That way, we not only
destroy the stuff

527

we take out the driveway

528

and, with any luck

get some collateral damage

For any other reason
