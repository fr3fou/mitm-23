1
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,350
Oh, with the boys asleep
this house is so quiet!

2
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:25,510
Mm-hm. Such a nice
idea to build a fire.

3
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:27,510
Yeah.

4
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:31,240
Hey, I didn't build a fire.
I thought you built a fire.

5
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,000
Well, looks like Reese got
a D... in English.

6
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,350
And Dewey seems to be
fighting again. Biting.

7
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:51,230
Malcolm, tell your teacher I'd love
to chaperone the class overnight!

8
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:53,330
We can share a tent!

9
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,550
# Yes, no, maybe

10
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:59,390
# I don't know

11
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:02,670
# Can you repeat the question?

12
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:04,870
# You're not the boss of me now

13
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:07,310
# You're not the boss of me now

14
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:08,710
# You're not the boss of me now

15
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:11,790
# And you're not so big

16
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:14,110
# You're not the boss of me now

17
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:16,350
# You're not the boss of me now

18
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:18,790
# You're not the boss of me now

19
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:21,670
# And you're not so big

20
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:25,480
# Life is unfair #

21
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:30,790
I can't believe you're allowed to do
a video project instead of a paper!

22
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:35,110
You... could have asked! My parents
aren't rich enough to buy a camera.

23
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:39,870
(WHEEZES) Rich... and compensating.
I don't know what to write about.

24
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:41,710
What's your movie gonna be about?

25
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:45,390
The creative... process.

26
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:47,910
You writing...

27
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:50,470
..your paper.
Is that on?! Turn it off!

28
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:53,110
You'll make me
look like an idiot.

29
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:55,750
I'm serious!
This is...

30
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:58,670
..great! Now knock... me over!

31
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:00,950
(PHONE RINGS)
Hal.

32
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:04,590
Hey, it's Abe! Hi! I
know it's short notice,

33
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:08,310
but someone dropped out of our poker
game. Can you make it tonight?

34
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:11,110
I've been waiting
for this for months!

35
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:13,470
See you at eight.
Thanks!

36
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:16,030
Wah! Yah!

37
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:21,550
Honey, guess what, guess what! I'm
gonna play poker at Abe's tonight!

38
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:24,710
Tonight's our first
dance class! That's tonight?

39
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:27,590
Yes! It was your
birthday present to me.

40
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:30,000
Oh...!

41
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,590
Fine, go play poker.
I LOVE YOU! Mwah! (CACKLES)

42
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:55,950
Great(!) Who am I gonna go with?
Did Reese finish his homework yet?

43
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:59,310
Of course! Good! Come
to dance class with me.

44
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:02,470
What? I was lying.
I didn't finish my homework.

45
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:05,520
I don't know what my
homework is! Go get your shoes.

46
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:14,230
(WIND HOWLS) If the weather report's
right this storm will last a week.

47
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:18,430
Now, you ration these
supplies. Make no mistake,

48
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:22,790
you're the last ones we'll dig out.
We're supposed to live for a week

49
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:27,630
on meat paste and caribou jerky?!
That's a week I don't get any work
out of you!

50
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:30,080
No-one's cryin' for me!

51
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,390
It's just a friendly game.
We sit around talking

52
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:41,120
and eventually get around to cards.
Good. I want to meet your friends.

53
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,840
Everybody, this is Hal.
Hal. Hi, Hal.

54
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,230
Hal, this is Brian,
Trey, Steve and Malik.

55
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:55,280
(CLEARS THROAT)
It's great to meet you.

56
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,480
So, what's the buy-in?
$50.

57
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:10,280
There. So, what's with Wanda?
Ain't no thang! (ALL) Whoa!

58
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,630
(ALL LAUGH UPROARIOUSLY)

59
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:18,910
Put a dollar in
the pot. (ALL LAUGH)

60
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:21,990
Oh, we got a regular D-dog here!

61
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:24,950
(ALL LAUGH)

62
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:29,390
Right, left, cha-cha cha! God made
artificial hips for a reason!

63
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:32,830
Use them! And
back. Cha-cha, finish.

64
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:35,960
Very good. Everyone, let's pair up.

65
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,440
May I?
Oh,... OK.

66
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,160
No way!
You be a gentleman!

67
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:56,150
It's just like touching a corpse...
It's just like touching a corpse...

68
00:04:56,250 --> 00:05:00,070
How many lessons
have you had? What? None!

69
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:03,990
Really? I'm impressed!
You have very good instincts.

70
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:07,310
I do?
Mm-hm. You're built for it.

71
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:11,510
You have a dancer's ankles.
I do not!

72
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:17,790
You're a lovely young man. You don't
shake like all the other men here!

73
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:20,390
Mind if I cut in?
You wait your turn!

74
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:24,400
I'll give you five bucks
to dance with me. OK!

75
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,870
And still... he has...

76
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:42,350
..nothing!
Alright! That's it!

77
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:45,750
I'm writing about
you doing a movie.

78
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:50,750
But my movie's... about your paper.
Yeah. I'm doing my paper

79
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:54,230
about your movie
about me doing my paper!

80
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:56,310
Fine(!)

81
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:58,550
My movie's...

82
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:01,560
..about you doing...

83
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,750
..your paper...

84
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:08,760
..about me doing...

85
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:13,590
..my...
Alright, I get it!

86
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:15,470
..movie...

87
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:17,510
..about you...
Hey, guys!

88
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:22,870
You should do your movie about
old people. They've saved money

89
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:27,030
for years, and outlived everyone
they wanted to share it with.

90
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:29,280
Talk about sad!

91
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,600
Raise you five. I'll see
your five and raise you...

92
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,310
..two.
(ALL CHUCKLE)

93
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:51,110
Call. Full house!
Kings over eights.

94
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:54,870
Straight flush to the jack.
I knew you had it!

95
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:59,950
But he had nothing on top! He never
stays in unless he's got something.

96
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:03,670
Well, perhaps we
should call it a night.

97
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:07,430
We're definitely
bringin' you back! (ALL LAUGH)

98
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:12,990
When was the last time you won?
He can't remember that far back!

99
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:17,080
Now you got something to sneak
INTO your wife's purse! (ALL LAUGH)

100
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,910
I had the most
wonderful time at dance class!

101
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:25,830
Every time the instructor
showed us something,

102
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:30,070
he used me as his partner. I always
thought I was such a clodhopper!

103
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:34,710
I cannot believe what I have missed
all these years. How was your game?

104
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:38,270
Hm? Oh, it was great!
Why wouldn't it be?

105
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:42,190
I love Abe! I love poker! A whole
night playing poker with Abe...

106
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:45,550
..and his friends.
I have a dancer's ankles!

107
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:49,590
What do you think, huh?
Wanna dance with the star pupil?

108
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:52,550
Huh?
You know,... dance.

109
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:56,390
No, I'm not in the mood.
You're always in the mood!

110
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:59,510
Not every single night!
Yes, you are!

111
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:02,150
I'm not some kind of machine!

112
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:06,630
You can't just snap your fingers -
Yes, I can. I always have.

113
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:09,200
Oh, alright!

114
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:17,080
Pumpkin oil, pectin,
manganese sulphate and...

115
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:22,470
..zinc oxide? Yes!
That's meat paste, baby!

116
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:25,950
This sucks! We knew we were
gonna be stuck here for a week

117
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:30,590
and no-one brought a deck of cards?
I could do my foot-puppets again.

118
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:34,710
Please, no! How long
have we been stuck here for?

119
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:38,710
I have lost all sense of time.
I'd guess about five days.

120
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:42,910
We just gotta keep ourselves busy.
Let's put our heads together

121
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:45,790
and recreate episodes
of Gilligan's Island!

122
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:49,350
We already did that.
That was this storm?!

123
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:53,520
If we don't come up with something
to do, I will go insane!

124
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,790
Come on, Reese! We're gonna be late!
We're doing the mambo tonight.

125
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:11,470
I'll be home about 10:30.
Eeargh! Arrgh!

126
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:15,790
What are you doing? Is it too much
to ask for pickles that are edible?!

127
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:19,470
Hal, what's wrong?
Nothing. Just go to your class.

128
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:24,630
Look, you have been snapping
at everybody all week.

129
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:28,790
My class can wait one minute.
Now, you tell me what's going on.

130
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:33,870
(SIGHS) OK. This thing happened.
I didn't wanna talk about it

131
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:37,750
because I'm not sure it happened
and if it didn't I'd be a jerk

132
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:41,630
for saying it did when it didn't.
I'd be creating this BIG issue,

133
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:44,030
but it did happen. Ohhh, it did!

134
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:49,590
I've recently come into a little
money so I went to the mall to buy
myself a CD player,

135
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:52,270
then I saw a kid
who looked like you

136
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:54,990
and I thought of
something better.

137
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:57,190
Here.

138
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:59,520
Wow!

139
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:07,310
The look on your face!
It was totally worth it!

140
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:11,280
You're the worst
brother ever! I know! I know!

141
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:16,910
Oh, we like to think the differences
people have aren't differences,

142
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:20,510
but then I'm taken advantage of
because I'm different!

143
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:24,000
I'm sorry, I gotta go.
We can talk later. Bye!

144
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,760
(RINGING TONE)

145
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,280
(RINGING TONE)

146
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,270
(RINGING TONE)
"Hello?"

147
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:55,160
Abe, it's Hal. "Please leave
a message after the beep."

148
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:03,110
Abe, it's Hal. I don't know if this
is recording, but we need to talk.

149
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:06,670
I could be mistaken, and if I am,
it's gonna make me sound like -

150
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:08,880
"(BEEP)"

153
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:25,310
Dammit, Stevie,
I don't wanna hear it! You behave!
You are a guest in this house!

154
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:29,630
He was a guest in your house! People
should never yell at children!

155
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:32,270
Especially children
that aren't their own!

156
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:35,790
I apologised two minutes later!

157
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:40,550
And Stevie accepted the apology! You
know, he's not that fragile. Relax!

158
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:45,350
Really. What? At least I'm man enough
to apologise when I've been a jerk!

159
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:49,590

You know what I'm talking about.

160

If you're implying
what I think you're implying.

I think you better.

164
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:09,510

buddies all ganged up on me

165

and lawyer and dentist friend!

just because he's a working stiff!

168
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:24,870
And I bet you had
a big laugh about it!

I'd mop the floor with you.

We did play in a straight game. And
you went home crying to your momma!

173
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:49,120
Let's play right now and we'll see
who will do the crying and who will
do the mopping. I will own you!

I gave it to Francis.

it back to Eric.

What are you trying to pull?

reason for saying that, Eric?

208

You seem to have a motive
against the string.

No, I love the string! It's - Maybe
you loved it a little too much.

the string, no-one will."
