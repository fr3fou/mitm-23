Red zone, mister! Tomorrow night
I am taking your mother out

154
00:10:43,496 --> 00:10:48,056
on an emergency date. It will be
a beautiful, romantic evening

155
00:10:48,056 --> 00:10:50,216
that we need very badly

156
00:10:50,215 --> 00:10:54,175
and nothing is going to derail it
on penalty of death!

157
00:10:55,536 --> 00:10:57,496
Good.

158
00:10:58,975 --> 00:11:01,495
Do you want your army man?

159
00:11:02,914 --> 00:11:06,114
So, how's he doin'?
I was up with him all night.

160
00:11:06,115 --> 00:11:09,675
He got pretty wild
but I think he's doin' better now.

161
00:11:09,674 --> 00:11:11,714
I wanna die!

162
00:11:11,714 --> 00:11:16,154
Why can't I just die?!
Stop talking like that, sir.

163
00:11:16,153 --> 00:11:20,993
This is just a momentary setback.
I have nothing to live for.

164
00:11:20,994 --> 00:11:23,834
Mother no longer acknowledges me.

165
00:11:23,834 --> 00:11:26,554
I have no friends, no money.

166
00:11:26,553 --> 00:11:30,273
I won't even tell you
how I paid for my journey up here.

167
00:11:28,274 --> 00:11:33,114
If it means anything to you, sir,...
you taught me how to be a man.

168
00:11:34,243 --> 00:11:37,723
I have no idea who you are.
You don't remember me?

169
00:11:38,811 --> 00:11:43,291
After the hell that you put me
through, you don't even remember me?

170
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:47,500
Cadet Dudley?
No, Eric!

171
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:50,706
I just spent the last ten hours
cradling you!

172
00:11:50,711 --> 00:11:54,471
Sir, this is because
you're not feeling useful. Look,

173
00:11:54,478 --> 00:11:59,158
I think I may have found you a job.
A what?

174
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:03,246
It'd be with the Interior Department
helping the environment.

175
00:12:03,253 --> 00:12:07,253
You would be making
a real difference. I can do that.

176
00:12:07,261 --> 00:12:11,141
Thank you, son.
And, please, thank that girl

177
00:12:11,146 --> 00:12:13,866
for rocking me in her arms
all night long.

178
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:24,268
Bleurgh!

179
00:12:28,598 --> 00:12:33,318
Alright, who's ready for a fantastic
night on the town? Oh, Hal!

180
00:12:33,327 --> 00:12:37,287
They're beautiful! Just give me
two minutes to freshen up

181
00:12:37,294 --> 00:12:39,894
and I'll be ready to roll!

182
00:12:39,898 --> 00:12:43,138
Just stay put, Dewey.
You're doing great.

183
00:12:43,144 --> 00:12:45,824
We've been in here for three hours!

184
00:12:45,829 --> 00:12:49,229
Hey, I'm just looking out for
your best interests.

185
00:12:50,796 --> 00:12:54,436
Dad just came home. Let's tell 'em
now so it ruins their date.

186
00:12:54,442 --> 00:12:58,522
Or we can wait till they come home
and they might be drunk. True.

187
00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:01,110
Alright, boys,
your father and I are leaving now.

188
00:13:00,115 --> 00:13:03,835
I've left you the number for
the restaurant. If we get a call,

189
00:13:03,842 --> 00:13:07,882
it better be from the coroner.
Nothing is gonna ruin this night!

190
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:12,370
My lady,... your carriage awaits.
(BOTH GIGGLE)

191
00:13:15,902 --> 00:13:19,422
Well, I'm outta here. Back at ten?
Sounds good.

192
00:13:19,428 --> 00:13:23,268
Dewey, you and your dopey dog
are on your own for an hour or two!

193
00:13:23,275 --> 00:13:26,675
Nope. Why?
Did something happen to the dog?

194
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:30,521
Oh, he's fine. He's just busy
destroying your comic books. What?!

(BARKS / GROWLS)

That's it! You're getting rid of
that thing right now!

197
00:13:40,025 --> 00:13:43,105
And you're gonna pay for this!
I don't think so.

198
00:13:43,109 --> 00:13:45,349
Oh, I think so!

00:13:51,547 --> 00:13:53,787
I wasn't talking to him.

202
00:13:59,161 --> 00:14:03,041
Ever since the day I was born
you guys have been torturing me.

203
00:14:03,047 --> 00:14:06,967
I remember you trying to switch me
for another baby at the park.

204
00:14:06,973 --> 00:14:10,813
I remember you telling me
the tooth fairy was a vampire.

205
00:14:10,821 --> 00:14:15,781
I remember every booger sandwich,
every stink hat,...

206
00:14:15,789 --> 00:14:20,309
Dewey, we're sorry! ..every
waffle butt, every Chester Backster

207
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:24,597
and every purple nurple!
And now you're going to pay.

(BARKS)
Dewey, this isn't gonna work.

209
00:14:27,409 --> 00:14:30,809
Mom and Dad'll be home soon, that dog
will be gone,

210
00:14:30,815 --> 00:14:34,255
you'll be in trouble and
we'll kick your ass for ten years!

211
00:14:34,261 --> 00:14:38,061
I know. So we'd better get started.
What do you want?

212
00:14:38,789 --> 00:14:40,789
Everything.

213
00:14:40,794 --> 00:14:42,874
I want everything.

214
00:14:42,877 --> 00:14:47,637
Hal, this place is beautiful!
It's so romantic!

215
00:14:47,646 --> 00:14:50,966
Everything is fabulous!
Yes, it is fabulous.

216
00:14:50,971 --> 00:14:54,731
They have your favourite - oysters!
We'll have to order those.

217
00:14:54,737 --> 00:14:59,217
Actually, I had a big batch
of oysters for lunch. You did?

218
00:14:59,226 --> 00:15:02,986
Where did you get oysters? A guy has
a cart outside the building.

219
00:15:02,991 --> 00:15:07,911
Besides, I am dying to try this
plain broth. They're famous for it.

220
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,760
For their broth?
Is that your friend from work?

221
00:15:09,766 --> 00:15:12,766
Who? That fat old man?
Never mind.

222

10 to 15 degrees colder?)

OK.

I'll never tell! (LAUGHS)

00:15:28,357 --> 00:15:33,357
I love this! I'm having
such a great time. Me, too.

Excuse me.

Go and buy me some medicine,

some cold medicine, and serve it
to me in a champagne glass.
