1
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:21,440
'I agree, Mrs Wiggins.
These pastries are delightful.'

2
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:28,710
Son, whatcha doing? I'm having a tea
party with Mrs Bear and the ladies.

3
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:31,670
Oh, that's... good.
Care to join us?

4
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:34,150
Yeah, I have...
actually,... a...

5
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:39,150
Why don't we go buy that stealth
bomber model you've been asking for?

6
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:41,720
OK.
OK.

7
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,790
Sometimes it's
just too easy.

8
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:50,230
# Yes, no, maybe

9
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:52,550
# I don't know

10
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:55,630
# Can you repeat the question?

11
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:57,840
# You're not the boss of me now

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,630
# You're not the boss of me now

13
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:05,390
# And you're not so big

14
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:07,550
# You're not the boss of me now

15
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,870
# You're not the boss of me now

16
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:11,510
# You're not the boss of me now

17
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:14,280
# And you're not so big

18
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:18,840
# Life is unfair #

19
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:26,710
Want to camp in front of PC World?
The Norton anti-virus is out.

20
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:29,350
Your mom let you?
She's there now!

21
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:34,550
Are you serious? What's the big deal?
We have a life outside this place.

22
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:38,030
How are we doing, gentlemen?
Everyone sticking to the experiment?

23
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:41,630
Absolutely. Right on track, sir.
I know how tempting it is...

24
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:44,430
..to stray from a
rigidly defined protocol.

25
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:47,350
It's the siren's song
of pure research

26
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:52,390
but you must resist
her seductive powers because...

27
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:55,800
(ALL) Unstable compounds
require stable minds.

28
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,640
Jackass. It's like
he's talking to children.

29
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,790
It was a legitimate variation.

30
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:18,870
There was less than
a 48% chance this would happen.

31
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:22,750
Well, your cavalier disregard
for the laws of the classroom,

32
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:27,270
not to mention the laws of nature,
have led to the inevitable.

33
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:31,990
It will now take weeks
to decontaminate that classroom.

34
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:37,310
During that time, you'll be placed
back into the general population.

35
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:41,030
(ALL GASP) We can't do that.
The whole school hates us.

36
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:45,710
They'll destroy us!
Rage is a projection
of their own insecurities.

37
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:48,990
And as for me... I've been
offered a temporary position

38
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:52,670
in the phys ed department
where I'll get to wear a whistle...

39
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:55,230
..and dress in shorts!

40
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:58,680
I'm sure none of this will
be reflected in your grades(!)

41
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,670
Don't play connect the dots
with your chickenpox.

42
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:08,070
You'll get an
infection. I'm bored!

43
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:12,990
I know. It's no fun being sick.
I'm bored! I'm itchy! I'm bored!

44
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:17,030
Honey, remember we were gonna use
our not-horrible voice? I'm bored!

45
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:19,910
Then find something to do! Here.

46
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:22,870
Play with these.
I don't wanna.

47
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:25,350
You will be contagious for six days.

48
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:29,830
Want to spend them here,
like a good boy, or in the hospital?

49
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:34,680
You don't go to the hospital
for chick... OK.

50
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,310
Damn it! Maybe we
could tack up a blanket.

51
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:47,510
I'll tear the porch down
and build another one.

52
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:50,750
Good luck getting permission
from the council. What?

53
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:54,910
Part of the house is on tribal land,
from the window to the wolf picture.

54
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:57,990
What? The whole house
used to be on the reservation,

55
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:00,990
but my idiot grandfather
built it on a glacier.

56
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:05,550
It moves two inches a year. In
100 years, we'll have a lake view.

57
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:09,880
Wow. So, part of this house
is on an Indian reservation?

58
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,760
Dealer has 20.

59
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,870
Look at them. All they're
thinking about is how many places

60
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:26,990
they'll dispose of my body.
Hey, Ian, Eddie!

61
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:29,440
How are you doing?

62
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,750
What are you doing?
There's no more seats.

63
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:38,200
There's a seat over there.

64
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,320
Scoot over. Go sit down.
You're gonna get in trouble.

65
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,640
Hey! Hey!
Wassup? Wassup?

66
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,120
God, it's so great
to have a normal conversation.

67
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,910
Abandon all hope,
ye who enter here.

68
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:03,830
Is that from the new
Ministry album? What?

69
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:07,030
Abandon all hope. Is that
from the new Ministry album?

70
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:09,510
Actually, it's
from Dante's Inferno.

71
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:15,160
It's the inscription over
the gates of hell. That is way dark.

72
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,270
Kick that guy's butt!
Remember when I did?

73
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:26,840
No, he kicked your butt!
You want me to kick your butt?!

74
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:42,270
Argh! Damn! A splinter!
You are dead! You are dead! Argh!

75
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:45,070
Don't pick! It
will get infected. What?

76
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:48,830
You're making it worse. Let me
get it. You carry a first-aid kit?

77
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:52,150
Just a crisis pouch.
I leave the kit in my locker.

78
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,630
There. Wow! That
didn't hurt at all!

79
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:57,880
Thanks.

80
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:08,990
Hey, Dewey. Wow! Look at that!

81
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:12,910
Is this helping take your mind
off the itching? It was.

82
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:16,750
Oh, you've got a split
and you've got a crossover.

83
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:19,190
All those dominoes.

84
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:21,670
All set up.

85
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:24,880
Just ready to...

86
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,590
Hey! Check out Alesha.

87
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:37,960
En fuego.
Totally.

88
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,350
Yeah, she's cute.
Check out Pam.

89
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:44,310
Muy en fuego.

90
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:46,310
Totally!

91
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:48,960
Yeah, she's cute, too.

92
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,920

Except Herkabe, I guess.

97
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,910
We heard the cleanup crew's gonna
put their dumpster where we skate.

98
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:26,910
Where are we supposed to go?
Why do they pick on us?

99
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:30,230
Damn Krelboynes.

100
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:33,440
I'll think of something.

101
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,270
Hey, Malcolm. Can you
settle this? You know Stacy?

102
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:42,160
Yeah. Is she en
fuego or muy en fuego?

103
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,320
Hard to say.

104
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,470
My God! Dewey!

105
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:55,950
Look what you've built here!

106
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:58,640
You have stairs and a ramp!

107
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,830
You've spelled your name.

108
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:05,310
Oh, so many,...

109
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:07,790
..many dominoes.

110
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:10,910
Where did they
all come from?

111
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:16,190
From the Lippers. They got a crate
the year Mr Lipper was paralysed.

112
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:18,990
They even buried him
with one of his dominoes.

113
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:23,750
So this isn't really a complete set.
Oh, no, Dewey, don't scratch.

114
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:27,950
It's itchy! I know, but sometimes
you just have to restrain yourself.

115
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:31,630
Even if you feel like ripping
your eyes out of their sockets

116
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:35,910
rather than go one more second
without... scratching.

117
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:40,440
Will you watch this for me? I have
to go to the bathroom. OK, son.

118
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,350
Reese! Don't even think
about it! What's going on?

119
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:04,550
He was about to knock down
Dewey's dominoes. What?

120
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:07,590
I didn't do anything.
You're not going to.

121
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:12,030
They're keeping Dewey from driving
my crazy! If they get knocked over,

122
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:17,790
I'll blame you. If a door slams and
knocks them over, I'll blame you.

123

If a condor dies in flight,

124
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:24,470
crashes through our roof and knocks
them over, I'll blame you!

125
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:27,920
But that's not fair.
I will blame you!

126
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,670
Don't. What?
I saw that look.

127
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:38,990
What look? My look!
Now I know where I got it from.

128
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:42,750
I have no idea what you're talking
about. I'm gonna get a drink.

129
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:45,230
Let's go.

130
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:47,960
I can get it myself.

Fact - most cleaners remove
dirt but could leave bacteria.

156
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,120
It's my lip colour.

157
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,340
The lip duo
compact

158
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,220
that lasts
up to 16 hours.

159
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,320
Because you're worth it.

160
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,880
It's important to help protect
my skin from the sun.

161
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,740
And I want to keep it
feeling firmer too.

L'Oreal Solar Expertise
Collagen Sun Protection.

163
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,140
Our first anti-ageing,
firming sun cream

164
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,020
that helps protect
against premature skin ageing.

165
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,120
It helps my skin look
younger and feel firmer.

166
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,100
Yes to summer,

167
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,300
no to premature
skin ageing.

168
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,400
Because you're worth it.

169
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:19,990
Man, I can't believe the school gave
the skaters our basketball court!

170
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:24,590
Skaters safety program.
Sounds suspicious. So what do we do?

171
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:28,670
We kick their butts! Guys!
Guys! There's an easier way.

172
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:33,070
We'll take over the east court.
No, that's where the Goths hang out.

173
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:36,160
Why don't you let me
worry about the Goths?

174
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:40,830
They can't take our court!
That's where I second-hand smoke!

175
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:43,830
Some old lady complained
we were scaring her.

176
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:48,590
No, you weren't. Look at this
handwriting, the girlish swirls.

177
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:52,190
This is no old
lady. It's Dabney.

178
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:56,950
Well, where are we supposed to go
now? What about the posers' corner?

179
00:14:57,050 --> 00:15:00,030
You're trippin' if
you think you'll stop us!

180
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:04,430
This is our turf now! We're in the
middle of a student council meeting.

181
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:09,070
That ain't no thang. Thang is 200
years of oppression in this country.

182
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:14,070
What are you talking about? It's off
the hook. Justice in the hole, too.

183
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:17,030
You haven't heard
the last of this!

184
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:19,550
Sucker!

185
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:23,600
Um, Kevin,... you're supposed
to wear underwear with those.

Do not make me blow this!

00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,600
Who removed my whistle pea?!
That is a detentionable offence!

189
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,870
It's awfully tempting, isn't, Hal?

190
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:02,870
Go ahead. I'll
blame it on Reese.

191
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:06,000
You'll get off scot-free.

192
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:13,710
Alright! Pencils down!
Turn in your geometry tests.

193
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:16,160
But I didn't study!

194
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:34,440
Turn around, old man.
There's nothing for you here.

195
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:43,120
I can't take this any more.
If I hear one more en fuego...

(SCHOOL BELL RINGS)

197
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:18,030
..and six on top for the dealer.

198
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:22,510
Whoops! Free deal.
Hey! I had blackjack!

199
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:26,150
You're cheating me out of
my winnings! Come on. Relax.

200
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:29,470
I don't want trouble.
It's all in the tribe, right?

201
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:32,590
Let's just calm down.
I don't wanna hear it.

202
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:35,070
It's what your
old man used to pull.

203
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:40,590
He was nothing but a lying jackass!
Tell me something I don't know.

204
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:44,830
This was just a misunderstanding.
There. You got your chips back.

205
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:48,040
See? We take care
of our own, here.

206
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:55,400
Francis, maybe you should - I'll
turn the fan on once Ivan leaves.

207
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,870
Dewey? I spoke with the doctor. He
says you can go to school tomorrow.

208
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:05,630
OK. Tomorrow?
So the dominoes...

209
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:08,080
Go back in the
crate tonight!

210
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:15,750
Let me make this easy. I'm not
leaving until I know you're at work

211
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:19,160
and I can wait all day.
All I've got is school.

212
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:27,510
Hey, Malcolm! I'm sorry. I can't
listen to you talk about who's hot.

213
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:33,590
This stuff used to sound fine to me,
but now it's stupid! You are stupid!

214
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:37,470
I don't mean that in an insulting
way. I mean that in a factual way.

215
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:41,910
You wanna say hot in a different
language? There are 700 languages!

216
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:46,470
Vary it a little! We came to tell you
a fight's going down at the school.

217
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:50,120
Between who?
Everybody. Oh, man!

218
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,520
Hey, come on,
dealer. Let's go!

219
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:59,150
And that's seven for the dealer.

220
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:02,470
Piama, where have
you been? Shopping.

221
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:06,830
You were supposed to relieve me. Do
you know what time it is? Now I do.

222
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:11,310
Where did you get the money?
I took $200 from the stash!

223
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:16,600
But that's all our money! We can't
afford that! It's all in the tribe.

224
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,920
Ha!
Huh?

225
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,960
Wha...? Wha...?!

226
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,270
What happened?
I cleaned them up.

227
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:48,230
You knocked them
over?! Without me?!

228
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:51,960
Why would I knock them over?
I spent four days setting them up.

229
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:59,750
What's going on? Why did you
spend all of that money?! Hey!

230
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:02,830
You talked about
easing our people's suffering.

231
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:06,070
I suffered a little less today.

232
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:08,870
You don't spend money
and not say anything.

233
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:12,190
What's the problem?
It's all in the tribe, right?

234
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:14,670
That's what this is about?

235
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:18,630
Am I overstepping my bounds
because I'm white? No, but it's...

236
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:21,790
It feels weird.
Look, we're married.

237
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:25,790
That means I'm part of your family
just like you're a part of mine.

238
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:29,190
If I had anything in my
heritage besides mini vans

239
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:33,870
and non-stop screaming,
I'd share it. It's not the same!

240
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:37,510
Because I'm not your people,
I don't deserve that money?!

241
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:40,590
Why are you so obsessed
about the money?! Because!

242
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:43,310
I wanna pay Lavernia so we can go!

243
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:46,590
What do you mean?
We live here! What?!

244
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:49,790
You want to spend your life
in this godforsaken place?

245
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:53,750
This godforsaken place
is where I grew up! It's our home!

246
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:57,230
You should have
said something!

247
00:20:57,330 --> 00:21:00,030
I have been
complaining about this place!

248
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:03,870
I thought you were a complainer!
You complain about everything.

249
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:07,110
Yeah, but this is real.
I hate this place!

250
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:11,760
I can't even imagine raising
our kids here! Kids?! I hate kids!

251
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,550
These seem like some
pretty big issues. Yeah.

252
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:23,310
You know, we got
married so fast...

253
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:26,560
So what are we gonna do?

254
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:35,270
We both like wrestling movies.
Yeah, and we both like pizza.

255
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:40,200
I love pizza! Sausage and
mushroom? Yeah,... on half.

256
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:56,950
We wait till the jocks take out
the Goths and then we swoop in.

257
00:21:57,050 --> 00:22:00,030
I made an alliance
with the drama club.

258
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:03,430
When the skaters see me
drop my cape, they'll come in.

259
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:07,190
No-one'll expect us to be working
together. Is this a good idea?

260
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:10,830
It's too late for second thoughts.
The tribes have Balkanised.

261
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:15,430
(SIGHS) They don't
like each other. Oh, right.

262
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:18,240
We don't stop until
we have total control.

263
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:35,870
Deploy special shield.
(CHANT) We're just right,

264
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:37,870
we're OK,

265
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:41,070
we're smarter
now than yesterday!

266
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:43,870
School is fun,

267
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:46,560
cos learning is for everyone.

268
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:52,550
They've got Derek.
He bites. No! Stop!

269
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:57,150
This has gone too far. Look what
you've been reduced to! I'm helping!

270
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:01,430
We all used to hate this school
equally! We hated the teachers!

271
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:04,910
We hated the administration!
We hated the building!

272
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:09,470
But now you've taken that hate
and turned it against each other!

273
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:13,430
And why? Because people dress
differently or talk differently?!

274
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:17,870
You're just making school even worse!
Dabney was a Krelboyne two weeks ago.

275
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:23,070
Now he's a jock! That proves that
these differences are meaningless.

276
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:27,230
We need to focus on what makes us the
same, because if we hate each other,

277
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:29,830
who's gonna hate school?

278
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:33,230
You were a Krelboyne?

279
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:37,630
Ha! You've got a Krelboyne!
You guys got one right behind you!

280
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:40,990
He's the one who wanted
to fight in the first place!

281
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:43,920
Hey, we got one, too!
I found one!

282
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,920
He's our leader!

286
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:13,790
Thanks for the heads-up
on the underwear. No problem.

287
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:17,790
What is with the self-pity?! Albert
Einstein had to carry spare pants

288
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:21,790
until he was 24 and
did he cry about it? No.

289
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:26,710
He drew on that experience and
helped build the first nuclear bomb.

290
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:29,280
Now buck up and
get in the van.

291
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:52,640
