1
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,560
Good night, honey.

2
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,680
Good night.

3
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,920
Oh, honey, please not
tonight, it's freezing.

4
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,870
# Yes, no, maybe

5
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:15,670
# I don't know

6
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:19,030
# Can you repeat the question

7
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:21,240
# You're not the boss of me now

8
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,190
# And you're not so big

9
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:30,680
# You're not the boss of me now

10
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,990
# And you're not so big

11
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:41,360
# Life is unfair #

12
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,950
What do you think,
more salt, more cilantro,

13
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:49,510
a little zing of Tabasco?

14
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:53,310
It's perfect,
I can't taste any more.

15
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:57,470
OK, dips - creamy,
salsa, crab and compote.

16
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:01,550
Chips - potato, corn, blue corn,
sour cream and onion,

17
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:04,030
salt and vinegar, Kettle. Bait.

18
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:06,910
Is this why I didn't
get a birthday present?

19
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:10,590
This is my first time
hosting the poker game.

20
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:14,510
I want everything perfect -
at least better than their stuff.

21
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:18,310
Oh, do you know Brian's daughter,
Chandra? Yeah! Of course.

22
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:23,110
Brian's bringing her and a friend.
Kristen? Ah, yes, something,

23
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:26,960
but Brian is playing poker
so I need you two to entertain them.

24
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:32,190
Don't bother us.
I want you and those girls

25
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:34,880
in your room,
all night, got it?

26
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,230
There's your birthday present.

27
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:43,910
Who's Chandra? She's
no-one to you, understood?

28
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:49,110
Set one foot in our room tonight -
you're dead.
Where am I supposed to go?

29
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:52,270
I don't care but
if I see you tonight,

30
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:56,310
I'll charley horse every muscle
in your body. But... Ow!

31
00:02:56,410 --> 00:03:00,910
It disturbs me how much I enjoyed
that. Don't make me do it again.

32
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:03,030
Hi, honey.
Hello.

33
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:05,790
You're working late?
Yeah, 10.30.

34
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:09,830
Good, something came up. I've got
to have dinner with someone. Who?

35
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:14,710
No-one. It's just some old business,
I don't want to talk about it, OK?

36
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:19,470
Can I help? No. I promise, I'll tell
you everything when you get home.

37
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:23,280
OK. Thanks. He'll be gone
by the time you get back.

38
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,320
Did you catch
that "he" part?

39
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,920
Hey, Brian, how are you?
They're here, get out.

40
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:47,350
Boys, I know you know Brian
and you kids know each other. Yeah!

41
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:50,150
No.
Anyway, entertain yourselves.

42
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:53,510
Your father and I have
to conduct some business.

43
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:56,910
He has some of my money
in his wallet. Bring it on!

44
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:59,750
May I take your wrap?

45
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:04,350
Just cos Dad dragged us to this dump
doesn't mean we have to talk to you.

46
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:07,870
Show us where we can sit
where we won't catch fleas.

47
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:11,480
I'm going to see
what Dewey's doing. Hey.

48
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,670
You're Stevie, right?

49
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:19,430
Can we help you in?

50
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:23,510
I'm not... deaf.

51
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:26,440
Did you hear him breathe? Ah.
Ah.

52
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:32,270
Did you hear the one about
the astronaut and the hooker?

53
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:34,750
Yeah, I didn't get it.

54
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:38,630
Dewey, I told you
to stay in your room.

55
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:41,960
But Reese said - This is
man time, you can't be here.

56
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,190
How's the dip?

57
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:50,630
This is a sweet table. What is it?
A 52-incher? Yes, sirree!

58
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:55,790
Nice, I've got the 54. But you don't
have my built-in drink holders.

59
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:58,710
Or my extra padded leather
around the edges.

60
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:03,440
You can play all night and not feel
it in your wrist. This is nice, too.

61
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:11,790
How do you live with only three
keys, I've got five. I've got nine.

62
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:15,750
Guys, guys, guys, do we
have to do this every week?

63
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:18,910
You're right.
So, er, how's the kids?

64
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:22,870
You're just asking so you can talk
about yours. Why shouldn't I?

65
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:26,030
James has made
captain of the wrestling team.

66
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:28,870
Stevie wrote a
brand new program.

67
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:32,040
My daughter's essay
won a trip to the White House.

68
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,880
Malcolm has an IQ of 165.

69
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:41,760
We know, you've been
using that for six months.

70
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:48,190
(SHOUTS) Would you like
something from the kitchen?

71
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:50,270
(SHOUTS) No,...

72
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:53,670
..thank you. (SHOUTS)
He doesn't want anything.

73
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,790
Do you think they'll
offer to change his diapers?

74
00:05:56,890 --> 00:06:01,630
I can't believe Stevie's putting up
with this. I'll take care of it.

75
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:06,150
Let me explain something. Stevie's
no different than the rest of us.

76
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:09,710
He plays video games,
he does chores around the house,

77
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:14,310
he goes to the movies with friends.
He leads a completely normal life.

78
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:17,910
It's sad that he only has
two months to live. What?

79
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:20,640
Stevie, they have a right to know.

80
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,280
Oh, my God, is it true?

81
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,510
I've been told...

82
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:32,280
..I'm very brave.
(BOTH) Aw!

83
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,790
1.29 - that didn't beat Malik.
So Malik wins the breath-holding.

84
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:50,550
Abe got the most dip on a chip.
Trey has the longest neck.

85
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:55,000
Steve has the highest socks and Hal,
well,... Hal has nothing, so far.

86
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:00,790
The doctors are baffled. Stevie's
brain is too big for his head.

87
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:05,720
It's pressing up against his skull.
He only has two months
before it explodes.

88
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,360
It's called encephalo...

89
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,590
neurop... er,... litis.

90
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:17,990
How horrible!

91
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:21,360
What do you think
you're doing? Helping Stevie.

92
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:26,190
It's weird but it feels good.
I like being the hero.

93
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:30,430
You're pimping a fatal disease to
take advantage of a girl! For good.

94
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:33,510
Stevie, this is so unfair.

95
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:36,680
I have... no regrets.

96
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:41,000
Well,... one.

97
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:55,190
Old business, what do you think
that means? I dunno.

98
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:57,910
An old boyfriend?
I have no idea.

99
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:01,310
Those old relationships
can really get a hold on you.

100
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:06,630
What's up with her ex-husband?
He's still in jail.
Didn't his parole just come up?

101
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:12,510
I dunno, maybe.
She'll tell me about it tonight.
Man, I really admire your maturity.

102
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:16,430
Thank you. I'm the opposite,
I over-analyse everything -

103
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:19,350
like how Piama
didn't kiss you goodbye,

104
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:24,030
or her ex-husband being locked up
without a woman for five years.

105
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:27,990
That's what's wrong with me,
one suspicious conversation

106
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:32,790
and I'm picturing sweaty bodies
rolling around in front of a fire.

107
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:36,280
God, I've got a lot
of growing up to do.

108
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,310
What are you doing here?

109
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:45,760
You've kicked me out of my room.
I've nowhere to go. Not my problem.

110
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,720
I don't want to hear you cry,
it's a real mood killer.

111
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,400
Thanks, this light's
much better for his eyes.

112
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,910
The music... helps
regulate... my heartbeat.

113
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:14,830
I've got to call his vitals
in to the doctor.

114
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:18,400
# "I'll Never Break
Your Heart" - Backstreet Boys

115
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:30,030
Missing something?
What did you do with it?

116
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:33,230
What are you doing
with a gun? Give it back.

117
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:36,310
No! You don't bring a gun
into this house.

118
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:40,470
Where is it? This is where my family
lives. You don't even know them.

119
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:43,950
What the hell is wrong with you?
Tell me where it is.

120
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:46,830
No way. It's not
mine, it's my boyfriend's.

121
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:51,190
His parents search his room.
Well, they should, he's got a gun.

122
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:53,760
Tell me where it is.
No.

123
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,400
It's not even mine.

124
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:10,000
Ooh! Do you have anything
in this house that isn't junk? No.

125
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,870
Oh, damn!
Ahh!

126
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:20,320
Who can stuff the most
pretzels in their mouth?

127
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,320
OK, who can throw
a potato chip the farthest?

128
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:49,310
I've never met anyone
who was gonna die.

129
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:52,070
We're all dying...

130
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:54,590
I'm just...

131
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:58,110
..going... before Thanksgiving.

132
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:01,790
That's terrible.
It makes me...

133
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:04,630
..appreciate...

134
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:07,910
..the time... I have.

135
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:10,630
Wow! That's beautiful.

136
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:14,040
You're so... alive.

137
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,990
Can I... tongue-kiss you?

138
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:23,790
What? I'm sorry...
The pressure... on my brain.

139
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:27,830
Aghh, aghhh.
Ohhh, you poor baby!

140
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:30,470
(GIGGLES)

141
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:34,950
What are you doing here?
What do you think? Go pee outside.

142
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:38,190
Oh, for God's sake.

143
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:40,680
Out.

144
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,380
Get everything you need

145
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,980
to make summer last.

146
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:44,080

only, at Boots.

As we age, skin
loses its plumpness

149
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,640
and wrinkles appear deeper.

Enriched with patented:

and wrinkles appear
pushed up. Like this.

153
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,860
Plumper skin,

154
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,960
wrinkles
appear reduced.

155
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:40,910
"At the tone the time will be
8.22 and 30 seconds."

156
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:43,430
"(BEEP)" Right
to the millisecond.

157
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:46,240
I'm two seconds off.
I'm three. Same here.

158
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,670
Hal, you don't even have
a minute hand.

159
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:52,720
It's really more
of a decorative piece.

160
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,120
Where is it?
Where's what?

161
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,710
Full house, nines over aces.

162
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:18,430
Yeah, looks like I'm on a roll

163
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:23,230
and I expect to stay on one once
I get home, if you know what I mean.

164
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:26,590
What is this, the third
Wednesday of the month? Ooh!

165
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:31,070
Hey, I do fine, thank you very much.
Oh, yeah, what's the number?

166
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:35,160
Whoa, we're not going to do this.
Just deal the cards, will you?

167
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:39,360
Three. Four. Four. Four. Five.

168
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,590
Two.
Two? Oh.

169
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:46,880
Just twice a week?
Oh, per week? Oh, then,...

170
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:51,830
..14.
14? Come on. No way.

171
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:57,480
He's telling the truth,
I went on vacation with him.
If anything, he's underselling.

172
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:01,550
Well, I guess I win.

173
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:07,470
I mean, it's none of your business.
Don't care how you wear your socks,
you ain't beating that.

174
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:10,200
Hey, hats off to you, man.

175
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,680
Now we know why you're bad at poker.
How do you keep your eyes open?

176
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:20,630
Watch out, she must be angling
for something big.

177
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:25,710
What are you talking about? You
don't get anything free with women.

178
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:30,510
With that attitude it's no wonder
you're not doing any better.

179
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:33,630
(ALL) Oh! Don't
put that on me, pal.

180
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:38,190
Can we...? When was the last time
you sent your wife flowers?

181
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:42,790
How come it's the man that has to
send flowers? I would love flowers.

182
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:46,150
Might as well stretch,
this is gonna take a while.

183
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:49,790
Women are independent beings
who can make their own...

184
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:55,630
..choices. Look at any
successful relationship, you'll find
one common element - trust!

185
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:59,190
Fine, but I didn't need
the hour-and-20-minute speech.

186
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:02,670
I was going to ask if
you wanted to take off early,

187
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:05,910
but evidently you're
not concerned so I - (BANG!)

188
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:08,560
(DOOR SLAMS)

189
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,430
Do you like... this?

190
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:20,270
Yeah. Do you know something, Stevie?
Maybe it was meant for me
to be here with you.

191
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:24,430
Wasn't it fate that made Dawson's
Creek a rerun so I came here?

192
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:27,870
I guess... fate...

193
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:31,070
..can be kind,... too.

194
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:34,280
Oh, this is so awful!

195
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:39,910
Stop... It's OK.
No, it's not OK.

196
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:44,510
I keep thinking about everything
you're gonna miss out on.

197
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:49,510
You're never going to grow up. You're
never gonna go to your prom.

198
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:53,720
I mean, you're never gonna know
what it's like to be loved.

199
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:01,110
What I'm thinking about doing goes
against everything I believe in,

200
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:05,110
but, then, I don't even know
what I believe in any more.

201
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:10,720
It's, like, what kind of a God
could just let you die like this?

202
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:18,470
I'll ask...

203
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:21,390
..when I see him.

204
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:25,630
When was the last time
you just made time to talk to her?

205
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:28,750
You're perfectly happy
not sharing your feelings.

206
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:32,630
Just get off my back! There
it is, you're shutting me out.

207
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:37,790
Just talk to me! So you can twist
my words and throw them back at me?

208
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:41,310
How many times do I
have to apologise for that?

209
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:43,830
'You've been drinking.'

210
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:49,110
I warned you.
My boyfriend's coming over.
He's gonna get that gun from you.

211
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:52,390
Oh, little Marky's gonna
come over and scare me(!)

212
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:55,990
I broke up with Marky,
I'm dating Derek Fowler.

213
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:58,590
Derek Fowler?
He's a psycho!

214
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:02,310
What happened to Marky?
You guys were great together.

215
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:06,150
Derek's gonna make you tell him.
Where are you going?

216
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:11,190
I don't wanna be here when he
shows up. Chandra, I'm going home.

217
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:14,710
Sayon...ara!

218
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:17,550
Well, maybe I'll
just call the cops.

219
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:20,440
Let's hope they
get here first.

220
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,710
That's it, I've had it.
(Dewey, shut up.)

221
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:34,750
You guys broke all my stuff.

222
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:39,800
Look, I don't want you to ruin this.
This is all I have left.

223
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:45,400
There, now you've got nothing
to worry about. End of discussion.

224
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:53,950
Oh, my God, how can a night that's
turned out so badly get even worse?

225
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:57,560
Wait, don't panic.
Think for a second.

226
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,070
No, this is good,
this is sensible.

227
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:06,600
I make those kinds of statements
and just assume she knows I'm sorry.

228
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:13,710
And you know what, that's not right,
she deserves better than that.

229
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:18,350
That's all I needed to hear. I'm
gonna tell her how much I love her.

230
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:21,360
Let's go, man.
Yeah. Go.

231
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,400
Hello... Earl, is that you?

232
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:33,400
What the hell are you doing
at my house?... Hello?

233
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:40,950
I'm - I'm going to go home now

234
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:43,630
cos I've got a
thing to do tomorrow.

235
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:47,400
Ok, take care. Talk to you tomorrow.
Catch you later. Call you...

236
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:55,320
Well, I guess
the game's over.

237
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,670
(ALL) Yeah.

238
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:03,550
You know, I wondered why
Earl never came to the game.

239
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:08,190
Dad, I've tried to be understanding
about all this but there is a limit.

240
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:11,550
You have a right to know
what's going on.

241
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:14,350
Dewey, now is not
the time to be...

242
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:18,390
Normally, I don't mind being
a snitch but this even makes me sad.

243
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:20,960
This is what your son is up to.

244
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,310
Stevie?!

245
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:29,630
Where's Reese? About to take a
scented bath. What's going on? >

246
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:34,480
Lamb chop, put your
sweater on. Dad... I...

247
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,520
Stevie, how co-

248
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:45,150
It's not... what it looks like.

249
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:49,840
Well, it looks...
like she was on your lap!

250
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:55,630
(BOOM!) (ALL SCREAM)
Oh, my God, his head exploded!

251
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:58,440
Abe, are you OK?

252
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:04,110
I think so.

253
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:06,680
Oh, my God, I'm
sorry. Everyone OK?

254
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:12,350
I mean, what was that?

255
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:15,950
Face it, Dad,
you are a crappy father.

256
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:19,950
All you ever cared about was
women, drinking and stealing.

257
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:23,230
You know what? I can't
talk about this any more.

258
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:27,110
How many times do I
have to say it? I need money.

259
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:30,750
Guess who's home?
What are you doing here?

260
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:34,750
I got off early. Hello,
I'm Francis, Piama's husband.

261
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:40,030
You're married? Didn't think
that was worth mentioning?

262
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:43,350
Francis, I told you...

263
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:46,360
Hey, I had a life
before I met you.

264
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:52,470
Maybe I haven't been fair to you,
our relationship wasn't all bad.

265
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:56,360
Remember all the tickle fights?
Yeah, those were wild.

266
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:01,390
One time we were taking a bath
and she started squirming so -

267
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:06,510
Aghhh! I don't want to hear this.
C'mon, it's a funny story, Francis,

268
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:09,600
and he loves telling it,
don't you, Dad?

269
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,750
Dad?
Yeah.

270
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:16,310
I just... Oh, er...

271
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:18,910
I'm so sorry. I
just... I mean,

272
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:22,750
it's a pleasure to meet you, sir.
Do you have any money?

273
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:26,360
No. Well, tonight's been
a big ball of nothing.

274
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,360
I'm gonna go finish off my shift.

275
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,560
'Love ya, honey!'

276
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:45,950
You are never seeing that girl again
and never seeing that boy again.

277
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:49,510
You are not seeing daylight
for the next six months.

278
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:52,670
Just tell me what happened.
We...

279
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:56,430
..were playing...

280
00:25:56,530 --> 00:26:01,200
..cards.
OK. Let's start with you.

281
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:05,070
Well,...

282
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:07,750
..it's like...

283
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:10,390
..this.

284
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:13,670
You found the gun,
didn't tell your father,

285
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:17,870
handled it, hid it inside the house,
handled it again to move it,

286
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:22,870
tried to destroy it with a hacksaw,
and at no point did you contact
the police

287
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:25,630
until after the
gun went off? Yes.

288
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:28,240
What did you say your IQ was?

289
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:34,230
Man, what a night. Yeah.
I couldn't believe how scared I was.

290
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:38,070
You were scared?! I was
way more scared than you guys.

291
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:43,070
I screamed like a little girl.
I could have broke glass
the way I screamed.

292
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:46,030
You sounded like a hero
compared to how I screamed.

293
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:50,510
Straight up, I screamed.
I screamed, now, I screamed...

00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,080
You know when your cat
doesn't want to know.

You'll know when he doesn't
want to be disturbed.

And you'll know when he
