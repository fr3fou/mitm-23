Hal, did you replace that bulb?

6
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:14,160
What does it look like I'm doing?!

7
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,950
# Yes no maybe

00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:20,750
# I don't know

# You're not the boss of me now

# And you're not so big

# You're not the boss of me now

Here we are, Bernard.
This is my cage.

18
00:01:56,890 --> 00:02:00,790
Are you serious?
(WHISPERS) Mom? Dad?

19
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:03,990
This is Bernard,
the hamster from my class.

20
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:07,950
It's my weekend to take care
of him. This isn't a good time.

21
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:11,110
I want you to see how good
I am at taking care of him,

22
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:14,190
and how good I'd be
at taking care of a dog.

23
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:17,630
Did I mention that all
the other kids have dogs?

24
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:20,750
Honey, your father
and I need to talk.

25
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:25,590
I saw a nice one at the pet store
and I could name him Jeff and -

26
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:28,600
Go play in your room!
OK.

27
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,150
I'll put your cage
right here, Bernard.

28
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:40,110
Sorry I said I wanted
a dog in front of you.

29
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:43,150
Is your brain big enough
to get your feelings hurt?

30
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:46,600
Me neither. I'll
take good care of you.

31
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,920
Bernard?

32
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,920
(SQUEAK! SQUEAK!)

33
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:11,550
I thought you were getting a routine
check-up. That's when they find it.

34
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:15,280
Can't they do anything?
Not until they get the biopsy back.

35
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,320
There you are.
(SQUEAK! SQUEAK!)

36
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,990
You can't call that a short cut!
It has to be shorter! Says who?!

37
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:31,230
Says the word! It's just when
you don't use regular streets.

38
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:34,990
If it took 150 years
to cross the street,

39
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:38,390
as long as you went through some
bushes, that'd be a short cut?!

40
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:43,310
You hate being wrong.
Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.

41
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:47,590
What is wrong with you?
Look at that floor! Oh, sorry.

42
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:51,270
How many times have I said
don't track mud into this house?

43
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:54,550
We'll clean it up. Not good enough!
You're grounded for a week!

44
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:59,550
What? You can't do that!
Want it to be two weeks? Dad!

45
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:03,510
You heard your mother. This is
ridiculous! You're being unfair!

46
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:07,430
Just because Malcolm got mud on his
shoes and tracked it in the house

47
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:10,880
doesn't mean he should be
grounded. Go to your room now!

48
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,320
What's her problem? They're so boring
they invent stuff to be upset about.

49
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,630
Are you the biggest idiot
to ever walk this Earth?

50
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:30,470
Good morning. What did
I tell you to do, jackass?

51
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:35,630
Paint the kitchen, which I'm doing.
What kind of a moron
paints it white?

52
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:39,430
Wanna see all the dirt?
What'd they teach you in college?

53
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:44,230
I'm a high school dropout and I
used the paint that you left for me.

54
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:47,630
I moved that paint so you
could get to the green, idiot.

55
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:51,270
Do it over, even if
you're here all night! What?

56
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:54,910
That paint you wasted is
coming out of your pay.

57
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:58,240
I should paint it
the colour of your dye job.

58
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,520
What?
He didn't say anything.

59
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,070
I said maybe I should paint it
the same colour as your dye job,

60
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:15,520
you sagging, leathery,
hatchet-faced, dried-up old hag.

61
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:21,390
Alright, college boy, you want it?
You got it! I'm gonna kick your ass!

62
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:26,270
Excuse me? I'm kickin' your ass.
Don't ever disrespect me like that.

63
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:29,910
You can't challenge her to a fight.
I didn't challenge anybody.

64
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:32,550
Hey, Lavernie's
fightin' college boy!

65
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:36,630
(CHEERS) We've got an opening
Sunday at two before Mass.

66
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:39,790
Sunday. Two o'clock.
Your ass, my foot.

67
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:42,390
There's no way
I'm fighting a woman!

68
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:46,710
If I don't mind, why
should you? Oooooo! (ALL LAUGH)

69
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:52,200
See what she did? She called him
a woman. It's gonna be a blood bath!

70
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:14,070
You're right, Dewey. When was
the last time we played ball?

71
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:19,070
I don't know.
Sometimes life gets away from you

72
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:22,110
and you forget the things
that are really important.

73
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:24,400
AAARGH!! Egh!

74
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:30,670
This is crazy. I have enough on my
mind without worrying about you!

75
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:34,910
But, Mom - Don't leave this room.
I don't want to see or hear you.

76
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:39,710
I don't want to sense your presence.
For crying out loud, Reese,

77
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:42,430
there's a mirror right there!

78
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:46,560
Believe me, I am going
to watch that door like a hawk.

79
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,390
What's her problem?
This can't be about mud.

80
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:56,110
Something's going on.
What've you done lately?

81
00:06:56,210 --> 00:07:00,110
The Richardsons' fire, the
windshield, the Sampsons' fire,

82
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:04,430
the Jacksons' fire. Nothing
she knows about. This sucks!

83
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:07,190
Well, if you can't do the time,

84
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:09,990
don't do the crime. See ya Monday.

85
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:14,470
Hey, moron, do you know what tomorrow
night is? Christine Matson's party!

86
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:19,350
That's this weekend? Yeah, and
her sister's bringing her friends.

87
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:22,710
They tongue kiss
whether they like you or not!

88
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:27,590
It's shaking hands to them. It's
a cultural thing. We have to go!

89
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:31,790
Reese, if I show
you a way we can go,

90
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:35,950
do you promise never to let anyone
find out even though you're an idiot?

91
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:38,800
I swear.
OK.

92
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,990
I was saving this for a
life or death emergency...

93
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:46,510
..or a really good party.

94
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:49,320
Tell me!

95
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:58,310
No way. We're not hitting Mom
with that! Reese, tomorrow night,

96
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:02,750
we take out the floorboard and sneak
outside through the crawl space.

97
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:08,390
Wow. Tunnelling out of our own room.
She can't lock us in any more.

98
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:13,680
Mom's powerless. Yeah. Now she's
just a crazy old lady we live with.

99
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,360
Thanks, Dewey!

100
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:42,950
It's Dewey. Let's
hurt him, fellow idiot.

101
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:45,880
Yes. I hate him
for his handsomeness.

102
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,920
Aaaarrgh!

103
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,750
Hi, Dewey.
Hi, Lance.

104
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:11,630
Well, what do ya know?
It's Bernard. Let me see him.

105
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:15,590
You can't have him.
That's alright. I can wait.

106
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:18,270
Next week is my
turn to have him.

107
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:20,960
We're gonna have a lot of fun.

108
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,110
You can't keep the hamster.
He belongs to the class.

109
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:31,630
He won't be safe.
You take good care of him,

110
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:35,390
but you have to share him.
Lance isn't my friend.

111
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:39,320
He tore Billy's shirt off after
school and - (PHONE RINGS)

112
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,110
Hello? Yes! This is he.

113
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:45,790
He killed a frog
and brought it to school.

114
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:51,520
Dewey, I said no! Do you want to be
grounded like your brothers? No.

115
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:57,790
I've never seen her this worked up
for a fight. She's done this before?

116
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:01,270
Since I've been here,
she's fought five guys.

117
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:04,350
You're lucky you
got some warning.

118
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:06,590
Know Big Don?
The guy with one ear?

119
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:10,870
Yeah. He was going to the privvy
and she dropped on him like a spider.

120
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:15,310
What's wrong with her?
We were having a stupid argument.

121
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:18,030
How did it turn into a fight?
It's how we settle things.

122
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:21,630
There are three other
fights tomorrow. Four.

123
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:25,590
Ned cut in front of Daryl.
Well, I hate to disappoint you

124
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:28,990
but I'm not fighting Lavernia.
Really?

125
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:32,350
Are you sure?
No, he'll fight her.

126
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:35,510
No, I won't.
Thank you!

127
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:40,870
Fellas! It looks like we're having
a coward's cotillion. '(ALL CHEER)'

128
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:43,550
I'll get the dogs ready.
I'll sharpen the pig-sticker.

129
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:45,670
What are you talking about?

130
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:49,790
Fighting's the only entertainment
here. You've seen our TV reception.

131
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:54,670
If someone cheats the boys out of a
fight, there's a coward's cotillion.

132
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:59,310
What the hell is a coward's
cotillion? It's always different.

133
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:02,270
You never know what animal
the blood will attract.

134
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:06,710
My choices are to fight a woman
or the stupid cotillion thing?

135
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:10,270
Well,... there's always the...

136
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:12,520
..Howdy Stranger.

137
00:11:17,880 --> 00:15:35,990
.

138
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:38,090
.

139
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,670
How can they make us wait
another 24 hours?

140
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:04,040
They're short-handed at the lab.
Don't they realise it's your life?

141
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,750
Don't worry. This is for
the best. I'm setting you free.

142
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:17,640
You won't have to worry
about anyone being mean any more.

143
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:23,720
Come on, Bernard.
Run. Run like the wind.

144
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:33,520
You have to do this, Bernard.
It's for your own good.

145
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,000
I'll be OK.

146
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:46,310
Go on! I don't
want you any more.

147
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:49,600
I don't like you. I never did!

148
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:55,720
Go on! Go on,
you dumb old hamster.

149
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,120
Bye, Bernard.

150
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:20,550
Booby trapped? A broom handle tied
to a string of tin cans. A classic.

151
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:24,630
If Mom trusted us, I think
she'd be pleasantly surprised.

152
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:28,840
Yeah. We're basically good kids.
She's so unreasonable.

153
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:34,520
Are you almost ready?
Just a sec. Will you come on?

154
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,520
If anyone asks,
I'm in junior college.

155
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,320
< (SCUFFLING)

156
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,360
Hi, boys.

157
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:43,430
You don't know how lucky
you are. Everything is new.

158
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:47,630
Everything is open to you. Please,
don't ever take that for granted.

159
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:52,110
Make every moment
the best you possibly can.

160
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:56,240
God, I am so proud of all of you.

161
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:02,040
You kids are the best thing
I've ever done.

162
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,280
You'll never know
how much I love you.

163
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:14,400
Maybe you're not
supposed to. (SNIFFS)

164
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,190
Sleep well, my
little angels.

165
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:21,350
(BOOM!)
Aaaaargh! Aaaaaarrrgghhh!

166
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:24,680
Aaaaaaarrgh!!
Aaaaaarrgh!!

167
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,190
'(BOTH SCREAM)'

168
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:33,430
Amazing! I made out with a sophomore.
I'm so far ahead of schedule.

169
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:37,360
Did you see the TV fly off
the roof into the pool? That was me.

170
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,600
I hope we get
grounded next weekend.

171
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,640
'(BOTH SCREAM)'

172
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,950
How dare you?! How
dare you defy us like that?!

173
00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:01,950
We wouldn't have if you weren't so
hard over a little mud on the floor!

174
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:05,990
You two are the most ungrateful,
badly behaved, inconsiderate boys

175
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:10,630
ever born! How could you be
so heartless? What's heartless

176
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:14,390
about going to a party with
a bunch of slutty girls? Be cool.

177
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:19,550
You were at a party?! While we were
here worrying?! Can I have a napkin?

178
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:24,230
I cannot believe you two!
Alright. That's it!

179
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:28,470
You're grounded for the rest of
the school year! You can't do that!

180
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:33,390
You're crazy! You do not talk
to your mother that way ever!

181
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:37,790
You'll show her the love and respect
she deserves whether I'm here or
not!

182
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:42,360
This family sucks! You are ruining
our lives! I wish you were dead!

183
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:56,680
What was that all about? She usually
just says, "I'm taking you with me."

184
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,910
I want to tell you something.
We'll talk at two.

185
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:06,510
I'm gonna tell
you this right now.

186
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:10,630
I hate your guts. You're the most
horrible person I've ever met.

187
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:14,960
You are mean, sadistic, twisted and
spiteful. And I owe you an apology.

188
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:21,230
What I said was a cheap shot
about your looks

189
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:24,320
and you don't deserve that.
No-one deserves that.

190
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:28,470
You're right. Thank you.

191
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:32,670
What the hell are we doing this for
anyway? This won't solve anything.

192
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:35,710
We're just putting
on a show for idiots.

193
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:38,710
If you think you
have to prove something

194
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:42,350
because you're a woman,
you don't. You came and built

195
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:46,230
a successful business in this awful
place. You have accomplished plenty.

196
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:51,070
Oh, my God! You're
coming on to me! What?

197
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:56,190
Peddle your sugar to somebody else,
cos this bee ain't buyin'. What?!

198
00:21:56,290 --> 00:22:00,190
The last thing I need is some young
punk frolicking in my nethers.

199
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:04,360
You don't listen t...
I try to talk to you... Ew!

200
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:11,190
Do you hear anything?
Mom's still crying.

201
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:16,310
Did she ever go to sleep? At 3 she
went from sobbing to a quiet whimper.

202
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:18,910
She's just trying to psych us out!

203
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:24,190
I don't think so. When was the last
time you heard Dad yell and Mom cry?

204
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:26,910
You're right.
Something weird is going on.

205
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:30,920
They've been whispering a
lot, too. I just figured it out.

206
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,910
Oh, no. Oh, no!

207
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:38,160
(CHEERING)

208
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:46,150
I've never seen her like this.
What do you expect?

209
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:49,270
The boy tried
to jump in bed with her!

210
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:52,310
Dude, she's killing you!
Do something.

211
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:55,990
I will not hit a woman.
Then, here. Take this.

212
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:58,790
What is it? A
screwdriver. Jab and twist.

213
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:01,840
I'm not using the
screwd... Aaargh!

214
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,040
Fight. Ugh!
Back. Ugh!

215
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:15,790
Ease up on him. His
only crime was loving you.

216
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:19,510
Ugh! You disgust me.
You better run home to Mama,

217
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:24,310
so she can kiss your tears away and
make you cocoa and tell you - Ugh!

218
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:26,550
Yeah! Yeah! (CHEERING)

219
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:29,310
My mother's a tormented
control freak.

220
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:33,070
It would never occur to her
to make me cocoa!

221
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:35,590
(SPITS / PING!)

222
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:37,690
(CHEERING)

223
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:50,710
You're going down, college boy.
Bring it on, you toad.

224
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:52,810
(CHEERING)

225
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,640
Yeah! Yeah!
(WHISTLING / CHEERING)

226
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:35,480
Ned. Daryl. You're up.
Somebody help me clear this floor.

227
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:47,320
Alright. I'll
get the camera.

228
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:55,590
If anyone at school asks,
your name's Bernard.

229
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:58,600
You like carrots and
having your tummy scratched.

230
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:06,510
'No. We've been waiting for hours.
Now please give us the information.'

231
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:12,080
Negative?! Negative! That's
a good one, right? Yes, thank you.

232
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:22,200
If Mom does a load of blankets
I'll bring you a friend.

233
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:28,150
Oh! Mom. Dad. We
have something to say.

234
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:32,030
We know why you've been crying.
You don't have to protect us.

235
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:35,790
We think getting a divorce
is a great idea. What?

236
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:40,110
You don't have to stay together.
We've known for years it was a sham.

237
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:42,110
Your relationship isn't working.

238
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:45,870
Mom needs a man who'll control her
and Dad needs someone younger.

239
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:51,160
You both deserve some happiness.
I think we all do. Amen to that.

240
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,710
We should go to
a motel with Dad.

241
00:25:54,810 --> 00:25:58,550
Our bags are packed. Mom,
you're still part of our lives.

242
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:01,760
We'll see you every other
weekend. Call us any time.

243
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,950
We've already
discussed it.

244
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:10,760
I get full custody.
