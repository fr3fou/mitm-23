1
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,440
What - ?! (GRUNTS
FRUSTRATEDLY) Those kids!

2
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:51,320
Not my Frampton
Comes Alive...! (MOANS)

3
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:08,040
(LAUGHS ANGRILY) "Honest, Dad, we
didn't even know you had a watch!"

4
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,000
Thank God they paved
the drive last year!

5
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,590
# Yes, no, maybe

6
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:21,270
# I don't know

7
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:24,470
# Can you repeat the question?

8
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:26,640
# You're not the boss of me now

9
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,270
# And you're not so big

10
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:35,680
# You're not the boss of me now

11
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,670
# And you're not so big

12
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:46,120
# Life is unfair #

13
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:51,870
'Jury duty? They
want me to do jury duty?!'

14
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:54,590
I can't believe this!
You can't do it.

15
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:58,390
Spring break is coming up.
The boys are gonna be out of school.

16
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:03,430
I can't handle them by myself!
You're gonna have to tell them no!

17
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:07,670
That's not one of the options, Hal.
What are they thinking? Jury duty?!

18
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:11,390
This is America!
I don't have a choice!

19
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:13,590
Oh, yes, you do.

20
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:16,040
You wanna get
out of jury duty?

21
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,710
You just let me handle this.

22
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:23,240
(ALL) We, the jury,
promise to faithfully uphold...

23
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,830
This'll be great! I've
never been ice-fishing before.

24
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:32,190
It combines my two favourite
things,... ice and holes!

25
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:36,430
A bunch of guys roughing it! A true
test of courage and determination!

26
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:41,670
Man against the elements!
No crust on mine, thank you.

27
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:44,990
I hope you packed
enough toilet paper for four!

28
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:48,750
(ALL CHEER) You're kidding!
How'd you get Piama's permission?

29
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:52,550
I don't need my wife's permission!
I picked a fight. She kicked me out.

30
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:54,750
(ALL CHEER / LAUGH)

31
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:59,270
Oh, my God, Dewey, you are not
gonna believe what just happened!

32
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:02,670
We were supposed to go
exploring in the sewer!

33
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:06,630
I waited two hours for you! You're
not listening. This is incredible!

34
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:11,070
You promised that when spring break
started, you would take me!

35
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:13,950
I did all your chores,
all your homework,

36
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:17,470
I took your antibiotics -
Dewey, just shut up!

37
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:20,350
We're trying to tell you
something important.

38
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:24,350
We just saw Stevie's mom... naked!
And she's a total babe.

39
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:27,430
We were at Stevie's
getting stuff for the sewer

40
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:30,550
when we hear something
behind us. We turn around

41
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:33,590
and there she was,
in the hallway,... naked!

42
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:36,390
Buck naked, except
for her shower cap.

43
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:40,110
First she was screaming,
then Stevie was, then I was...

44
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:45,470
Yeah. Why'd I do that? Then she tore
the curtains down to cover up!

45
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:49,150
But you could see through them.
I'm so glad they just remodelled.

46
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:53,750
That is not a good reason! Mom walks
around here naked all the time!

47
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:55,990
She was naked
this morning. She -

48
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:59,840
If you've just combined those two
things in my head, I will kill you!

49
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,120
No, we're good. So, she was -

50
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,870
I got to get going.
Where are the boys?

51
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:11,670
At the library. I know. But if they
were doing something really bad,

52
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:14,470
they'd have come up with
a better lie.

53
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:18,470
So,... deliberations
start today. Nervous?

54
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:22,070
Nice try. You know I
can't talk about it. OK!

55
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:25,510
Is the counselman as tall
as he looks on TV? Hal!

56
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:28,350
Yes! Your eyebrow
went up! It did not.

57
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:30,510
It's the Panty
Bandit, isn't it?

58
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:34,350
This isn't right! We're married.
We tell each other everything.

59
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:39,670
We've never kept secrets from each
other in our entire relationship.

60
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:42,590
I keep secrets from you
all the time.

61
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:45,830
Oh, fine(!) Go! I
won't keep you from your...

62
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:48,200
..big, secret trial!

63
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,950
Thank you very
much! (CHORTLES)

64
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:00,350
For what? Oh,
nothing. Nothing at all.

65
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:02,960
You didn't say a word.

66
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,640
(CACKLES)

67
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:16,390
This sucks! We been here 15 hours.
We haven't caught a single fish.

68
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:19,750
How much longer will
this take? You never know.

69
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:23,430
I been ice-fishing my entire life,
never even seen a fish.

70
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:26,790
I'm with Francis. I got
bored on the drive here!

71
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:29,470
Can we at least talk?
About what?

72
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:33,280
We could use this opportunity
to get to know each other better.

73
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:40,600
You know, one time I walked in on
my two dads making love!

74
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,870
Guilty.

75
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:48,910
Not guilty.

76
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:54,110
And... guilty. That's
seven guilty and five not guilty.

77
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:58,190
The contention, for those of you who
don't think Marty stole the bike -

78
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:02,550
If it'll get us out of here earlier,
I'll change my vote. What?!

79
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:06,270
I don't feel that strongly
either way. Yeah, me, too!

80
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:10,110
Which side was winning again?
This is not a question of winning,

81
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:12,950
or of voting to
get out of here early!

82
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:16,670
We have to have some basis
for deciding. There was a trial!

83
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:19,510
And evidence, and laws...
Yeah-yeah-yeah.

84
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:23,230
Let's vote one more time
before we get into all that detail.

85
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:28,390
We might just get lucky.
Who wants to change their votes?

86
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:31,510
Whatever! There
you go! It's unanimous.

87
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:35,190
Hey, wait! What do
you think you're doing?!

88
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:37,990
You can't send
a 17-year-old kid to jail

89
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:41,790
just cos you wanna go home early.
For God's sake, we took an oath!

90
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:44,350
Did you vote guilty?
Yes, because -

91
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:47,600
Then, there's no problem.
We're all just agreeing.

92
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,680
Fine(!)

93
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,400
Then, I vote not guilty.

94
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:07,550
This is cool! There's no alligators
down here, right? That's made up?

95
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:11,190
But if there were, they'd
probably be blind, or albino,

96
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:13,990
or transparent!...
But that's not real.

97
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:16,510
This is so cool!

98
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:19,030
He hasn't shut
up all morning.

99
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:23,190
I was just as excited the first time
Francis took us. It's kinda cute.

100
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:25,790
Did you get the snake?
Right here.

101
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:28,710
They'll hear him
screaming in Russia.

102
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:32,350
Dude, finish the story!
She was standing there, buck naked!

103
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:35,990
I went like this. (GASPS)
Malcolm was like this. (GASPS)

104
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:40,790
It was incredible! The sun
was behind her. She was glowing.

105
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:45,360
A naked,... glowing... angel!

106
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,950
Stevie, back me up on this.
That's what she looked like, right?

107
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:53,750
Can we go now?
I get to lead! No, rear.

108
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:56,600
No, wait. Front!
I'll scout ahead!

109
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,190
What? You are
talking about his mom.

110
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:05,590
Change the subject. Show
some class. OK, I get it.

111
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:08,960
Whoo, Stevie! Is
that you or the sewer?!

112
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,910
It turns out it
wasn't a boil they removed

113
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:16,480
but the vestiges
of my unborn twin!

114
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:21,360
OK, let's just go.
(ALL) Yeah! Good idea!

115
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,160
Best idea I've
heard all day!

116
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:31,830
OK, here's something interesting.
There's a gigantic bear out there!

117
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:34,950
Don't worry. It's
part of living in Alaska.

118
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:37,920
How far away is it?
(GROWLING / CRASHING)

119
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,760
Well, answer the question!

120
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,280
(DOORBELL)
It's open!

121
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,350
I thought we were
having lunch today.

122
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:57,470
Huh? Oh, I'm sorry.
What's all this?

123
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:01,670
My research on the trial
Lois got assigned to.

124
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:05,750
Oh, my God! Reyes?! Did she talk
about the four-fingered magician?

125
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:08,550
Was he any good?
She won't tell me anything.

126
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:12,870
I dug this up on my own. Information
is being suppressed from the jury.

127
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:16,430
Lois will have to find Moynihan
guilty. Why not? He did it.

128
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:20,390
You're a fool! Everyone
knows the wife killed him.

129
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:23,790
What? She loved him.
Didn't you read the letter?

130
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:27,150
How come she didn't admit
being married before?

131
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:30,310
She was underage
and it was annulled.

132
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:33,630
It means nothing. The
judge ruled it inadmissible.

133
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:37,870
The same judge that won't allow
the cab driver to testify! Well,

134
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:41,670
if the wife did it, why did
four witnesses say they saw a man

135
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:44,670
leave the crime scene?

136
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:46,840
Oh! A man...

137
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,150
..like this?!
You just drew hair on!

138
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,710
If I could do
it, she could!

139
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:57,070
She worked for two years
at the Windmill Theatre.

140
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:59,280
Let me see that!

141
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,990
OK, here's our mark.
When we came here with Francis,

142
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:12,990
this is the farthest
we've ever gone. This is it?!

143
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:16,990
This is as far as you went?!
Who would brag about this?

144
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:19,670
Mr Alligator?
So, Stevie,

145
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:23,750
did your mom go
to college? What?!

146
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:27,150
Did she get a degree?
Was she in a sorority?

147
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:31,390
Wait a minute. Unless we thought
some girl called Molly Hatchet ruled,

148
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:34,190
this isn't our mark.
This has to be it!

149
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:38,390
We went right, right, straight,
left, right, left, and right again.

150
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:42,990
No! We went right, left, left,
then straight, left, right, straight!

151
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:45,150
No. We went...

152
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:47,250
..right,...

153
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,790
..left,...

154
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:52,710
..straight...
Oh, man, we're lost!

155
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:57,390
What? No! Oh, man!
What are we gonna do?!

156
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:01,110
Nice! We got him crying!
No, we really are lost!

157
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:06,230
What? What do we do?! I knew you'd
find some way to ruin this for me!

158
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:09,950
Even when you're trying to
be nice, you make me miserable!

159
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:12,830
And now... I get
to die in the sewer!

160
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:16,510
A perfect end to a
crappy life! Shut up, Dewey!

161
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:19,310
Alright. Let's focus
on finding a way out.

162
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:20,790
Stevie's mom must
be worried by now.

163
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:24,350
Shut up... about... my mom!

164
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:27,870
What? I simply made a
comment. You're... a perv!

165
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:30,910
I have a healthy interest
in the opposite sex.

166
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:34,190
Well,... they
don't... return... the favour!

167
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:38,030
What does that mean?
Girls... hate you.

168
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:40,670
That's not true!
Yes, it is.

169
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:44,670
Come on, Reese. You're a joke.
Yeah. Even I know it.

170
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:46,770
.

171
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,990
Marty claims he was at work,

172
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:45,150
but his boss says
he didn't show up until 6:00.

173
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:50,030
The gas-station attendant puts
Marty there between 4:00 and 4:30,

174
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:53,030
and as we remember from
testimony - Can we vote again?!

175
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:56,630
We've been through this
five times! We vote guilty,

176
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:59,910
she votes not guilty. We vote
not guilty, she votes guilty.

177
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:03,790
Yeah. So you go first
this time! Alright! I abstain.

178
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:08,150
(ALL GROAN) What is
it that you want, lady?

179
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:11,870
I want you to do your job!
Weigh the facts of this case

180
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:15,670
and make a reasoned decision!
You have the sworn testimony

181
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:18,990
of the arresting officer,
in which he states -

182
00:17:19,090 --> 00:17:22,390
Yeah, if you believe
what he says. OK! Fair enough.

183
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:26,150
It is a question of credibility.
You have a high-school dropout

184
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:31,390
with a history of reckless behaviour
against a police-force veteran.

185
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:35,710
You can't trust cops. They're always
comin' up with ways to get you!

186
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:39,510
That's right! My neighbour's a cop
and he's got a 30-foot boat.

187
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:42,830
How can he afford that
on a police salary?

188
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:46,280
They all get away with it!
(ALL TALK AT ONCE)

189
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,750
Stop!

190
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:53,230
This is not about
how you feel about cops!

191
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:56,830
This is not about who
you like and who you hate!

192
00:17:56,930 --> 00:18:00,550
This is about what you believe
happened, based on the facts.

193
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:04,750
Did Marty or did Marty not
steal the motorcycle?!

194
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:08,320
Wait,... I thought
Marty was the cop!

195
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,070
Fine(!)

196
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:13,360
Let's go through this again.

197
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:19,000
Yes? Is it OK to
hate you? Absolutely.

198
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:26,350
But the money was really being
funnelled to Mr Reyes's mistress

199
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:29,750
and their love child.
Once Moynihan found out,

200
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:34,190
it was "Good night, Mr Reyes".
You've... got... nothing!

201
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:38,070
He was seen arguing with the victim.
He can't account for his whereabouts

202
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:42,270
when the murder occurred, and they
found the murder weapon in his car!

203
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:45,830
Means, motive
and opportunity!

204
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:49,310
It's all a little too neat!
Because he's guilty!

205
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:51,870
My gut says he didn't do it!

206
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:54,920
Saying so doesn't make it so!
Talk to this guy!

207
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,440
YOU'RE AN IDIOT!

208
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:03,470
(CRASHING) Oh, my God,
that thing's a monster!

209
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:07,590
I've been around bears 40 years.
There's nothing to worry about.

210
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:10,590
Really? Yep! We just
got to stay real quiet.

211
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:13,550
Pretty soon he'll get bored
and fly away,...

212
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:17,030
..that is, unless
he's protecting his eggs.

213
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:19,870
This is crazy!
We can't stay here!

214
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:22,670
Somebody's got to
make a run for the truck.

215
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:26,390
That's a suicide mission!
Well, what are we supposed to do?

216
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:31,190
Stay here and starve to death?
He's right. I say we try it.

217
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:35,270
I vote for Eric. What?!
Go to hell! I'm not going! You go!

218
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:38,990
I have a wife at home!
And my life doesn't mean anything?

219
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:46,390
Artie's the camp outcast. Pete's an
old coot! It's a miracle he's alive!

220
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:49,750
I should've slit your throat
when I had the chance.

221
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:51,850
(ALL YELL)

222
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,790
This all looks... the same!

223
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:59,590
Yes, this is the same.
It's all been exactly the same

224
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:03,270
ever since the day I was born.
I start to trust them,

225
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:09,550
they make me regret it. I get
my hopes up and they destroy them.

226
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:12,160
I -
Shut up! We get it!

227
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:16,990
Every girlfriend you ever had left
you crying like a baby! What?!

228
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:20,710
Oh, who's Mr Big Shot now?
I'm a joke with the girls, huh?

229
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:23,790
What's worse, being
a joke or a crybaby?

230
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:26,590
I wasn't crying that hard!

231
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:30,870
You wet... your pants. Oh, like
you've ever even been with a girl!

232
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:33,510
I have... a note... from my doctor!

233
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:37,670
I could get a doctor if I wanted to.
THAT DOESN'T EVEN MAKE SENSE!

234
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:40,110
That's right!
Turn on each other.

235
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:43,910
Well, you know what?
No girls like any of you.

236
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:47,360
And I don't blame them.
You're all pathetic.

237
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,950
You know who's a
joke? Girls! Yeah!

238
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:56,870
They make our lives miserable. You
can never understand what they want.

239
00:20:56,970 --> 00:21:00,550
They always say, "Stop staring."
They don't laugh at farts!

240
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:04,270
They only wanna talk about clothes.
They cry... all... the time.

241
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:07,000
Man, this is helping us get out(!)

242
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,310
(FRANTIC PANTING)
Whoo! Time? Time?!

243
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:14,150
11 minutes.
(SHRIEKS TRIUMPHANTLY)

244
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:16,950
In yer face! See?
The wife did have time

245
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:19,510
to run down here from home!

246
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:22,990
That leaves her...
two minutes to stab him,

247
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:27,590
remove the head, and still make it to
the party in time. It makes sense!

248
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:30,790
And the blood magically
jumped to his clothes(!)

249
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:34,790
Do you really
need this spelled out?

250
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:38,430
After killing her husband,
she took off the bloody suit

251
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:41,470
and rubbed it all
over Moynihan! Impossible!

252
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:44,950
You just don't wanna be
proven wrong! I am not wrong!

253
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:49,510
The knife entered at a downward
angle. She was 5'2". He was 6'4".

254
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:53,230
She'd have had to ask him to pick
her up so she could stab him!

255
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:54,550
She could've stood on something!

256
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:57,310
Oh, she brought
a stepladder(!)

257
00:21:57,410 --> 00:22:01,110
Look! A milk crate! She could've
hidden behind the dumpster,

258
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:04,950
stood on the crate, pulled out the
knife and stabbed him several times

259
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:08,590
with a downward
motion, like this! (SCREAMING)

260
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:10,270
Agh!

261
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:13,400
(SCREAMING CONTINUES)

262
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:18,950
I may be fat, stupid,
colour-blind and dyslexic,

263
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:22,590
but I don't have three nipples!
Shut up! That's a mole.

264
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:26,750
You! Your family changed their name
so you couldn't track them down.

265
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:30,590
No-one will miss you.
I'm sure it started with an O.

266
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:33,390
All three of you
are pea-brained idiots!

267
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:36,670
And I do suffer more than
everybody else. (GROANS)

268
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:40,080
Let's just vote on it!
Who votes for Francis?

269
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:43,070
Who votes for Eric?

270
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:44,910
Artie?

271
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:47,070
Pete?

272
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:50,070
Four votes! No,
you tricked me! Argh!

273
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:53,670
He'll reject me!
I... I've tried me!

274
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:56,280
I taste awful! Arrgh!

275
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:06,350
Alright,... that's the worst thing
any of us has ever done.

276
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:11,110
I'm not proud, but we had no choice.
Like I care about your opinion!

277
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:13,710
Wait a minute.

278
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:18,070
Why don't we hear eating?
(ENGINE ROARS) He got to the truck!

279
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:20,390
Pete!
Pete! Pete!

280
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:23,680
See you in hell!
(SOUND OF ENGINE RECEDES)

281
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:30,310
The witness saw Marty gassing up the
motorcycle an hour after the theft.

282
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:35,430
That gas station closes at 5:00. Not
on Fridays. That's in the transcript.

283
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:39,400
Er, I think we're ready for
another vote! Lois?

284
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:46,040
Go ahead. By show of hands,
who thinks the defendant is guilty?

285
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,750
Great! Let's go
tell the judge. Wait!

286
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:54,310
I don't think
Marty is guilty. What?!

287
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:58,110
I went through all these papers.
The kid sings in a church choir.

288
00:23:58,210 --> 00:24:02,590
He wouldn't do something like this.
That is not fact. That's bias.

289
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:07,390
You're basing a decision on feelings
that have nothing to do with facts!

290
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:11,830
Facts are things, like witnesses
seeing Marty steal the bike,

291
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:17,070
like Marty being apprehended
while he was driving it!

292
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:20,990
Like Marty pulling tons of stupid
stunts just like this one.

293
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:24,950
Those are the facts. I just don't
wanna send that poor boy to jail!

294
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:29,270
Believe me, jail will do more good
than three years of military school.

295
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:32,790
Military school? I
didn't read anything about that.

296
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:36,550
Oh, yeah! I know I
saw that somewhere.

297
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:39,150
He dropped out of
vocational school.

298
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:43,350
After the school where he got caught
messing with the teacher's aid.

299
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:46,120
No, I know for a fact
that Francis went -

300
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,030
Who?

301
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:51,240
Oh, my God!

302
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:57,920
I think I have to excuse myself
from this jury. All in favour?

303
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,710
I'm trying to be
the best me I can be,

304
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:08,430
but I don't know what to say to
girls, so I say something mean.

305
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:11,750
I'm afraid of
getting hurt. My problem is,

306
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:15,310
I get so frustrated
over things I can't control.

307
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:18,710
I forget people have
their own will. I play...

308
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:22,910
..mind games.
It's all... I have.

309
00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:27,830
Why isn't there ever a
flash flood when you need one?

310
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:31,990
I really want a girlfriend.
I want somebody to hang out with!

311
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:33,750
Yeah. Someone
you can talk to.

312
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:36,150
Someone... to hug.

313
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:37,710
Someone to show my poetry to.

314
00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:40,000
You write... poetry?

315
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:45,150
I dabble. What do you
think of Brenda Pollock?

316
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:49,070
She's nice. She'd be good for you.
You'd make... a cute couple.

317
00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:52,550
I thought so, too.
Hey, I know this sounds weird,

318
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:55,640
but can I read you one
of my poems? We'd love it.

319
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,430
ARGH! AGH!
(ALL SCREAM)

320
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:01,990
(ALL) Aaaargh!

321
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:04,560
(ALL CONTINUE TO SCREAM)

322
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,710
(GIGGLING)

323
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:13,270
Hey! What happened?
Did you read them your poetry?

324
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:16,520
(GIRLS CONTINUE TO GIGGLE)

325
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:20,640
You guys can't
even do this right!

326
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:25,470
I wanna serve on another jury!
I messed up this time,

327
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:28,950
but next time I won't.
I don't schedule that.

328
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:31,750
I'm sure you have
connections. Please!

329
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:35,630
There was a mistrial. Everything's
backed up. You'll have to wait.

330
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:39,630
I'll do the best I can, if you'll
stop bothering me right now.

331
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:43,600
Deal! I gotta go. My husband's
probably going crazy without me!

332
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:50,240
