Where did you
come from, flubber?

00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:14,360
"Hello, Hal."

00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:20,350
# I'm so full of bacon,
my body's meant for shakin'

(MAKES DRUM-BEAT NOISES)

(MAKES WHOOPING NOISES)

9
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:37,350
Once again I have to be embarrassed
for the both of us. Yep!

10
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:40,550
# Yes, no, maybe

11
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:43,350
# I don't know

12
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:46,710
# Can you repeat the question?

13
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:48,950
# You're not the boss of me now

14

# You're not the boss of me now

# You're not the boss of me now

# And you're not so big

# Life is unfair #

22
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:16,950
Go straight to your job after
school. I don't want you to be late
on your first day. And no excuses!

23
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:22,830
I don't wanna hear, "A lion escaped
from the zoo", or, "The bus driver
went insane and refused to stop."

24
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:27,670
Francis's friend gave Reese a job at
the Circus Burger. It's perfect.

25
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:33,430
Reese gets to be bossed around all
day by the only guy on the planet
that's dumber than he is.

26
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:37,190
This job is stupid!
You do get to wear a paper hat.

27
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:40,430
You wanna drive, you have
to pay your own insurance!

28
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:44,030
Everyone else is insured! Why me?
They've got it covered.

29
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:47,520
Son, it's not as
simple as that. You see...

30
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,030
Good morning, everybody!
Say good morning, Charlie.

31
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:55,710
Show everyone
how alive you are.

32
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:57,950
My parents made
a deal with Dewey.

33
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:01,670
If he keeps his goldfish alive
for two months, he gets a dog.

34
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:05,630
Am I doing a good job?
You sure are.

35
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:11,470
(How is that fish still alive?)
(I don't know! He never feeds it.
He leaves it in the sun for hours.)

36
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:15,310
Last week there was banana
in it! I do not want a dog!

37
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:20,710
If the fish lives,
there's nothing we can do! Hal,
I expect you to take care of this.

38
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:24,030
What are you suggesting?
I'm not suggesting anything.

39
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:26,440
I just want it
taken care of.

40
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:34,120
Class, today we begin a new round
of independent study projects.

41
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,550
Hydrostatic equilibrium?

42
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:40,590
My God, I'm still on
integral quantisation.

43
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:42,950
My stepdad's right. I'm useless!

44
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:46,830
The cold, hard fact of life is some
are more advanced than others.

45
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:51,230
Some even think they're more
advanced than me. I never said that.

46
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:55,110
Yet you assume I'm talking about
you. You're looking right at me!

47
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:58,870
You're convinced, by virtue
of you being in this class,

48
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:04,670
your intellects tower above
the plebeians wasting oxygen
in the rest of the school.

49
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:07,310
But, to some,
you are nothing more

50
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:10,270
than howling primates.

51
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:15,070
I'm excited to announce we're
welcoming to our class a new
student.

52
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:18,750
A young man of
unparalleled intellect.

53
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:22,710
As near as we can measure,
his IQ is over 280.

54
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:25,710
(ALL GASP) Those
tests are culturally biased!

55
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:29,230
Think what you will. Your petty
fears no longer concern me.

56
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:33,070
I finally have the mental clay
worthy of my sculpting.

57
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:35,830
Barton is a white-hot comet
of brilliance,

58
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:38,830
blazing through our
dark corner of ignorance.

59
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:44,710
A mind of unfathomable reach and
enormous power. Can I come in now?

60
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:48,790
I told you to wait till
you heard, "A new era for man."

61
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:51,440
But there's a
bee out there.

62
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:57,310
So, assistant manager. How?
INS raid cleaned us out.

63
00:03:57,410 --> 00:04:00,350
So, from 12 to 5,
Monday, Wednesday, Thursday,

64
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:02,750
this is my domain.

65
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:05,910
I'm proof you don't need
to graduate high school.

66
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:09,470
That's just propaganda from those
money-grabbing diploma companies.

67
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:13,390
Sean, Doug, this
is Reese. Hey. Hey.

68
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:16,830
OK. Press cow for burger,
potato for fries.

69
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:20,870
I'm not sure what this is. Does that
look like a pig or a dog to you?

70
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:25,750
Wouldn't it be easier to put words
on the keys? Ah, a man of letters.

71
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:29,710
A word to the wise. I wouldn't
throw that in anyone's face.

72
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:33,430
Once you get your total
put the money in the drawer,

73
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:35,950
except pocket
transactions. What's that?

74
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:39,950
A morale builder. Once in
a while take 5 or 10 bucks.

75
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:42,910
Don't ring it up,
put it in your pocket.

76
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:45,910
You don't have a
problem with that, do you?

77
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:47,870
Oh, no. That's cool.

78
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:51,070
You've entered
the working world.

79
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:54,280
A world of adult responsibility.

80
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,270
I have her locker key.

81
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:04,870
If you wanna smell her
jacket later, let me know.

82
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:09,510
They found the last piece
of that guy. Oh, man!

83
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,990
If we're sharing toilet paper,

84
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:14,550
can we keep it
on the spindle?

85
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:18,910
If we're bringing this kinda stuff
up, my fiancee's coming Thursday.

86
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:22,270
Fiancee? What are you
taking about? I'm engaged.

87
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:24,750
I'm tired of playing the field.

88
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:28,750
You don't know any women.
That occurred to me, too,

89
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:33,150
so I ordered one from Russia.
A mail-order bride? That exists?

90
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:38,750
In the more irradiated
parts of Russia there are lots
of marriage-minded women.

91
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:41,550
That's my darling Svetlana.

92
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:44,230
Wait a second. Yep.

93
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:46,880
Svetlana.

94
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:51,310
How come you're
driving us to school?

95
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:54,080
That's what moms do sometimes.

96
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,320
(MOUTHS)

97
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,440
Argh!

98
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:27,550
OK, you know your Tolstoy
and your Eliot...

99
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:29,870
Let's see how you
do with the Bard.

100
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:34,030
"Every true man's apparel
fits your thief."

101
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:39,630
Measure For Measure, Act 4, Scene 2.
Could you hand me my green crayon?

102
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:44,430
Wow, he's right again. OK, let's try
Chaucer's The Shipman's Tale.

103
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:49,030
Should I start with the prologue?
Please. How about line 203?

104
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:53,670
"When your husband has gone off
to Flanders, I shall deliver you

105
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:57,870
from fear of slanders, and on the
word he caught her by the flanks

106
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:01,750
and clasped her closely,
giving her a riot of kisses,

107
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:07,510
saying softly, 'Keep things quiet'"
What are you doing? (ALL GASP)

108
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:11,230
Chaucer? I cannot believe
you're polluting his mind

109
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:14,080
with such pop
culture drivel!

110
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,270
I apologise for them, Barton.

111
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:21,910
I'll do everything I can to minimise
these annoying distractions

112
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:25,230
so you can concentrate
on the accelerated programme

113
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:29,320
I've laid out for you. Together
we are gonna astonish the world.

114
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:34,600
Would you like a
pixie stick? Thank you.

115
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,870
Having problems, Malcolm?

116
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:41,470
No, no, not you(!)

117
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:45,030
This stupid hydrostatic
equilibrium doesn't make sense!

118
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:49,390
It is hard. But don't
despair. I'm here for you.

119
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:52,670
I'll make sure you
get the help you deserve.

120
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:55,230
To estimate the pressure
at the sun's centre,

121
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:58,920
assume a constant density
of 1.41 grams per cubic cm.

122
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:04,470
Too fast? Herkabe made
you my tutor to humiliate me.

123
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:09,070
I thought it was to humiliate me.
Why is this so hard?! Don't give up.

124
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:12,710
Remember The Little Engine
That Could? You're not listening!

125
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:16,910
I get everything! There is nothing
I haven't been able to master.

126
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:23,190
I took algebra in 6th grade! I
rebuilt dad's transmission when I
was five! I read before I could walk!

127
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:27,030
I remember my
own birth. What?!

128
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:30,910
D'you know your heart stops
during your mother's contractions?

129
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:35,430
You seriously remember that?
Worst was the diaper changing.

130
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:38,280
That was the most
degrading week of my life.

131
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,510
So, what's it like
in there? Whaddya mean?

132
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:44,590
Well, your brain?

133
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:48,590
For me it's like, when
I'm thinking really hard,

134
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:51,030
my brain starts making
all these connections.

135
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:53,470
Those connections
make other connections,

136
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:57,670
then it feels like a bomb's
going off. Is yours like that?

137
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:02,400
More like a beehive. And every
bee has a brain like yours.

138
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,240
OK, ready!

139
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:11,870
That is so cool! I wish you had a
gun so we can really test this out.

140
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:15,840
Excuse me. Can I get
some help here? Hi, Greg.

141
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,830
I overheard your mom talking
and it's true. You've got a job.

142
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:23,350
I applied here
once. Didn't get it.

143
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:27,750
It's all politics. I guess. Whaddya
want? You to listen carefully.

144
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:31,750
My blood sugar's low so I don't
wanna burn up calories repeating
myself.

145
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:36,190
I want the jumbo clown burger
with fries, no pickles,

146
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:40,230
a slice of onion, centre cut,
and extra tomatoes.

147
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:43,790
Do the patie well on one side,
medium on the other.

148
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:49,750
Make sure they open a fresh package
for my bun. If it's stale I bale.

149
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:51,470
Seriously.

150
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:55,790
That comes to $5.45 and you
get free refills on the soda.

151
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:59,040
Heard that one before. Turns out
it's just for today.

152
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:03,070
What a sack!

153
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:06,520
That's a pocket transaction
if I ever saw one.

154
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:11,080
Oh, yeah. Right.

155
00:10:23,880 --> 00:13:09,230
.

156
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,400
Get great results
all around your home

157
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,340
when you try

158
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,380
new Cillit Bang Multi Power.

159
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,860
It was so quick and easy.

160
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,780
Look how it cleans this toothpaste

161
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,500
and my make-up
stains. What a shine!

162
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,860
And a new fresh smell.

163
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,700
For taps clogged
with limescale...

164
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,220
Look, it's amazing.

165
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,900
Clean as a whistle.

166
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,180
It also works
in the kitchen

167
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,860
and gets rid of cooking spills

168
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,380
with so little effort.

169
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,300
For great results

170
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,420
all around your home.

171
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,300
Try it now!

172
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,000
Cillit Bang Grime & Lime
Multi Power.

173
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,780
And no more tedious scrubbing

174
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,460
with Cillit Bang Grease & Floor.

175
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,900
The new
all-purpose cleaner

176
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
that gives great results
on large surfaces

177
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,140
and even
when used neat.

178
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,240
Cillit Bang
Grease & Floor.

179
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,080
(ALL TALK AT ONCE)

180
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,870
Artie, you throw one
helluva bachelor party.

181
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:23,310
I'm just sorry the nearest
stripper's 300 miles away.

182
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:26,030
Hey, how's she doin' anyway?

183
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:29,000
She took her top off!
(ALL CHEER)

184
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:36,310
Listen up! I'd like to say
a few words about my mate Pete,

185
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:39,470
on account of his
upcoming nuptials.

186
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:42,790
Many's the time,
when I've been feeling low,

187
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:45,830
I always knew I
could turn to Pete.

188
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:49,630
He'd be lying on his bunk,
trimming his beard with a lighter,

189
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:52,430
and I'd think, "Hell,
I'm better than that."

190
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:55,880
To Pete and his
lucky lady! (ALL CHEER)

191
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:03,150
What's with you? What are
we celebrating? It seems wrong.

192
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:08,910
If he wants to marry a stranger,
that's his business.
Is anyone thinking about this woman?

193
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:14,630
I'm trying to keep a stripper
in my head. Think about it.

194
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:20,590
She's gonna spend her life here
with Pete as her husband.

195
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:23,070
What poor creature
would go through with this?

196
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:27,910
Maybe her life's pretty awful.
Worse than this?
Does she live in a slaughterhouse?

197
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:31,710
Get dragged to work by horses? She's
no idea what she's getting into.

198
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:35,390
You're exaggerating.
It might work out fine.

199
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:37,560
(ALL CHEER)

200
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:48,070
How's business? Where were you?
I was meant to be home for dinner
but only you can cash me out.

201
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:53,550
Stay on my good side.
One day somebody'll have
to clean the bathrooms.

202
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:58,590
Whoa, this is uncool.
You can't take this much money.

203
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:02,870
Whaddya mean? Your till
is over $400 short. Look.

204
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:06,350
The point is to take
five or ten bucks. That's it.

205
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:09,990
Put the 400 back.
I didn't take it. Honest.

206
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:14,510
It's your register. Did he give
his register key to anyone? No.

207
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:17,230
I didn't take any.

208
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:22,670
I never even did a pocket
transaction. I saw you yesterday.

209
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:27,310
I wanted it to look like that. When
you weren't looking I put it back.

210
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:32,310
You didn't see it cos I
was being... sneaky. Nice.

211
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:35,310
Way to screw it up for us.
I didn't take it!

212
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:39,910
I'm not coverin' for you. When
the owner checks the books tomorrow,

213
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:44,080
that money better be here
or you're going down.

214
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:50,670
The change from apparent to absolute
magnitude. The formula is...

215
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:54,880
..A over B times K over D.
That's if K is...

216
00:17:55,920 --> 00:18:00,030
How do they expect you to learn
formulas? Use a mnemonic device,

217
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:03,680
like Enephru,
Babashar, Kalar, Dastrer.

218
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,870
Abalonian kings, Third Dynasty.

219
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:09,830
Stop complaining.
I have homework, too.

220
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:12,360
Ah, it's a butterfly.

221
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,270
You gotta help me.
What's goin' on? It's horrible.

222
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:21,360
$400 is missing from my register
and they think I took it.

223
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,030
Well, did you?
No, of course not!

224
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:29,110
I'm Barton. Who's this dork?
My tutor. You're kiddin'!

225
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:32,870
When I need you to be a genius
I find you've been faking it.

226
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:38,150
Calm down. How did this happen?
I dunno. My register didn't total.

227
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:41,710
Who was there?
Everyone. Me, Sean, Greta, Richie.

228
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:45,070
Richie? Why didn't
you say so? Whaddya mean?

229
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:50,520
He's setting you up. How do you know?
Because it's Richie! C'mon!

230
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,230
Wanna learn about the
real world? Not really.

231
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:59,110
Too bad. You're coming.

232
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:02,550
Dewey, cover for us. Make sure it
sounds like we're all still here.

233
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:04,470
Got it.

234
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:06,550
Ow! Stop it!

235
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:09,070
You shut up!

236
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:11,440
Stupid creeps! Ow!

237
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:15,360
(Did you get it?)
Yes, I got it.

238
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:20,750
Pet store owner said it was already
dead, but I suspect the worst.

239
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:23,630
Switch them tonight
when Dewey's sleeping.

240
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:27,270
It seems so sneaky and underhanded.

241
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:31,030
What kind of example are we setting
for the boys? Stop worrying.

242
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:33,320
The boys are fine.

243
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:40,710
Did you get the money? Yeah, you'd
like another 400, wouldn't you?

244
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:45,750
What are you talking about? Wow!
An entire colony of parasitica.

245
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:48,630
Get your own pizza, Dewey.
His name's not Dewey.

246
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:51,590
How come you had me call
him that all these years?

247
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:55,510
We know you took the money
and you're pinning it on Reese.

248
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:59,750
After everything my brother's done
for you! All the alibis, handouts,

249
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:02,670
all the times he's helped you
fake your death! Whoa!

250
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:08,110
I wasn't there today. I only came in
to cash out. You were there.

251
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:14,550
I had a break at 4:30. You coulda
snuck in then and taken it. Yeah...

252
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:18,560
You wanna play innocent? Fine.
We'll just let the police decide.

253
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:23,910
Whoa! What makes you think
they'll take your side?

254
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:27,270
Maybe cos you've been arrested
10 times for petty theft.

255
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:30,800
Excuse me, one of
those was for arson.

256
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,830
You're making a big mistake.
No, I'm not! Yes, you are!

257
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:39,110
No, I'm not!
Yes, you are.

258
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:41,790
He didn't do it.
This citation says

259
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:44,430
he was stopped at 4:20
at 18th and Wilson

260
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:46,950
for urinating
from a moving vehicle.

261
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:51,590
So? The Circus Burger is on Walnut,
which is at least 25 miles away.

262
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:54,310
He couldn't have been there
during Reese's break.

263
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:59,670
If the traffic was light.. And if
a '78 Bonneville could go 300 mph.

264
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:03,590
Otherwise, it's impossible.
Hey, way to go, Dewey!

265
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:08,110
Let me see that.
Is he right? Yes.

266
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:10,230
He's always right.

267
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:12,950
Sorry, Richie.
Come on, Reese, let's go.

268
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:17,070
But I swear to God,
I didn't take the money!

269
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:20,910
We still have a few hours.
Maybe we can figure...

270
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:25,800
I got the DVD player
but we need to steal another 600
if you want the surround...

271
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,310
..sound.

272
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:34,950
You may wanna hang on to that
receipt. I can't believe you lied!

273
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:39,470
Let's call the cops! Maybe
we could figure out a deal?

274
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:42,200
Whatever you want, it's yours.

275
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:47,510
We get to use your place
for a party any time we want.

276
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:51,830
Free burgers for life. I get to make
out with your girlfriend. Forget it!

277
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:55,160
Alright, the bean bag chair.

278
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:05,030
Wow! Pete, is that really you?
No, it's a reflection.

279
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:07,870
You can give these to Svetlana.

280
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:11,230
Eric and Artie should be back
any minute with your bride.

281
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:14,390
I gotta be honest, I'm nervous.

282
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:17,310
You are about to
marry a stranger.

283
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:20,470
Have you really thought about
what you're doing?

284
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:24,310
I've been thinking about
settling down for a long time.

285
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:27,880
But you don't know anything about
her. What if she thinks...

286
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,310
What if she doesn't like you?

287
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:35,790
I'd be sad but I'd reassure her
I'd support her anyway,

288
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:38,350
cos I made that commitment.

289
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:42,230
I'd spend the rest of my life
being sweet to her.

290
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:44,680
And also changing her mind.

291
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:48,880
Well, good luck, Pete. Thanks.

292
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:54,760
Svetlana's here, and she is
gorgeous! (BOTH LAUGH)

293
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,310
I must've misread the catalogue.

294
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:04,240
Just look how
light on her feet she is.

295
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,760
Hey, guys.

296
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:18,590
Oh, hey, Pete... Just
get that thing outta here!

297
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:23,680
I'll take care of it. I got it.
Why you? Cos I signed for it!

298
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:44,470
(CAR HORN) Our ride. How nice of
Richie to drive you to school.

299
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:48,350
His way of saying thanks
for a job well done.

300
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:52,150
Good morning, everybody.
Now, don't be disappointed...

301
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:56,080
Say good morning, Charlie.
Show everyone how alive you are!

302
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,990
Aren't I doing a good job?

303
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:03,680
Yeah, yeah. Great.

304
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:12,270
That little monster!

305
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:15,070
He's been buying his own fish
and switchin' 'em!

306
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:18,910
God only knows how many he's gone
through. He'll pay for this!

307
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:22,120
How? If we bust him,
he'll know we've been cheating.

308
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:31,430
We are so proud of the way
you've taken care of that fish.

309
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:35,950
Yes. You certainly proved to us
you can be trusted.

310
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:39,110
It's so nice to have a boy
who's so conscientious, responsible

311
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:42,800
and honest and who finds a way
to do the right thing.

312
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:49,110
Before we go any further,
is there anything you wanna tell me?

313
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:54,390
I want a beagle! You're not
gonna get it, you little sneak!

314
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:59,230
You've been switching fish, cos I
put a dead fish in there last night!

315
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:02,230
That's cheating!
You're cheaters!

317
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:09,680
It's not exactly textbook but at
least we're not getting a dog.

318
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:16,230
I cleaned out my cubby. You're sure
I can't talk you into staying?

319
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:18,870
Mom says I need
a healthier environment.

320
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:24,790
She thinks it's creepy you're using
me for your own self-grandiosement.
That's not what you need.

321
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:28,190
You'll never connect normally
with another human being.

322
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:31,310
People will recognise your
brilliance and loathe you for it.

323
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:33,990
The best you can hope for
is uncomprehending fear

324
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:38,310
which I can channel into great
things.

325
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:40,560
Please? Can I go now?

326
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,280
Sure. Go.

327
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,270
You, my ex-wife,

328
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:51,910
all of my therapists,
you're all the same.

329
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:54,590
Bye, guys.
Bye, Barton.

330
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:58,960
Good luck at NASA. Send us
a letter when you get declassified.

331
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:04,840
Mr Herkabe, we know
this is hard for you, so...

332
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:13,400
It's his dad. We
photo-chopped your head in.

In a place where nappies
are the law of the land...

336
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,240
...tonight one big kid
lives by his own rules...

337
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,800
...with only his trusty new Huggies
pull ups for night time.

338
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:05,560
He'll have the potty training pant
with all the absorbency of a nappy.

Get ready for...
