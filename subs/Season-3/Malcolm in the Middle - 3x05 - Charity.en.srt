1
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:22,750
Lois, are you about done? No! You
gotta get outta there - I'm late.

2
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:25,470
NO! You should
get up in time!

3
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:29,070
I WOULD if someone
didn't turn off my snooze alarm!

4
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:32,510
It went off every SIX minutes
for an HOUR! What are you doing?

5
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:37,560
Getting in, Lois! You are NOT!
Not until I am finished!

6
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,990
(HUSKY VOICE) I don't think
I'll be able to come in today!

7
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:48,190
I've got a pretty severe
fever, scratchy throat...

8
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:50,880
Cough.
("COUGHS")

9
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,790
# Yes, no, maybe

10
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:57,230
# I don't know

11
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:00,230
# Can you repeat the question?

12
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:05,310
# You're not the boss of me now
You're not the boss of me now

13
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:09,750
And you're not so big

14
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:14,430
You're not the
boss of me now

15
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:19,590
And you're not so big

16
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:23,680
# Life is unfair #

17
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,900
No.

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,350
No. No.

19
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:30,350
Wait.

20
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:32,350
No. No.

21
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:35,750
Gimme that! No.

22
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:37,140
No.

23
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,540
No.

24
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,060
Wait.

25
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,300
No.

26
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,110
No.
Hi, boys. Got a second?

27
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:48,390
You have a pretty good life!
Uh-oh.

28
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:51,390
Spend your days flying kites,
playing video games.

29
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:55,510
It's time you enriched your lives.
When did we have kites?!

30
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:59,030
I won't have you grow up to be
selfish little pigs.

31
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:02,470
So I volunteered you
to do some charity work.

32
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:07,600
You can choose between helping
old people, or helping poor people.

33
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:12,590
Or I can make you do BOTH!
OK! Old people.

34
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:15,030
(What can be hard
about old people?)

35
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:17,130
Poor people!
We want poor people!

36
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,440
Hi. I'm Francis. Mr
Price said I should see you.

37
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:33,190
Oh! I can't believe
how cold it is up here!

38
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:38,070
Course it is Alaska, but you'd think
they could dome the place, or...

39
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:40,830
put tunnels between the buildings.

40
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:45,320
You must know my buddy Eric Hanson.
He got the logging job for me.

41
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,270
Do you give out the axes?

42
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:52,630
Cos I'm a lefty if
that makes any difference?

43
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:54,630
What's that?
A broom, genius(!)

44
00:02:54,730 --> 00:03:00,710
Grab an apron, sweep out my pantry.
And quit starin' at my bosom!

45
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:04,830
You don't understand...
I came here to work as a logger.

46
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:07,390
Lemme tell ya
about loggers -

47
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:11,270
they're filthy, drunken,
low-life swine,

48
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:13,910
..and YOU are their slave.

49
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:18,430
You will feed them, do their laundry
and clean out their privys.

50
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:22,350
Don't steal, don't back talk, and
don't socialise with the Eskimos.

51
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:25,320
OK... WHAT'D I
SAY ABOUT BACK-TALK?!

52
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:39,830
Eric? Francis?! What's
goin' on? I thought you -

53
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:41,930
(SOBS LOUDLY)

54
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,640
I don't hear sweepin'!

55
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,390
You boys should be
so proud of yourselves!

56
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:54,760
People will really appreciate this.

57
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,710
I'm gonna say a
special prayer for you.

58
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:02,950
Yeah. That should make us even(!)

59
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:04,870
Why are we organising trash?!

60
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:08,230
It's not trash! It's
stuff donated to the poor.

61
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:12,920
Look, Reese, it's just like yours.
Except nicer. It doesn't have holes.

62
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,760
Well, this jacket
is better than yours!

63
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
You're right.

64
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,720
Everything IN here
is better than our stuff!

65
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,600
Haha! You're poor!

66
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,160
No wonder I never
got a rocket sled.

67
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,990
What are you doing? Trading! But-
Look, I'm making a donation.

68
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:48,470
Instead of ONE poor person getting
a new shirt, TWO poor people do.

69
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:50,570
What's wrong with that?

70
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,550
I can't move...!

71
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:59,470
Ten hours scouring deep-fat friers

72
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:02,990
with a 20 minute break
to de-tick sled dogs...

73
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:08,350
What's wrong with that woman?!
Her name's Lavernia. She controls
every facet of your life.

74
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:12,310
She finds out your weaknesses
then gets inside your head...

75
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:15,670
and makes you
hate yourself...!

76
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:17,710
Women...!

77
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:22,590
They're just like the woods.
Mysterious. Full of wolves.

78
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:24,630
(SOBBING)
Whoah...! Pull together man!

79
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:31,270
It could be worse.
At least we're making good money.
No, we're not! See her ledger book?

80
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:34,430
She charges us for EVERYTHING
and deducts it from our pay!

81
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:36,510
Food, rent, aprons,...

82
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:40,110
Hair gel.
My first cheque was for $6!

83
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:44,950
(ELECTRICAL SHORTING)
Great(!) Generator's out again.

84
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:48,430
So, what, we just
sit around in the dark?!

85
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:53,560
Oh, this isn't dark. Ever spent
the night in a caribou's gut?

86
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:58,440
Who is this old coot?
He's my best friend here!

87
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
(SOBBING RESUMES)

88
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:08,550
So nice of your boys
to help us out like this!

89
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:10,790
We've always LOVED this old church.

90
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:14,470
If you cut through the parking lot
you miss the traffic light on Sixth.

91
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:18,190
Keep up the good work, boys!

92
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:20,870
Alright, I'll be
back in two hours.

93
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:24,310
During which time I suggest you
think about the horrible...

94
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:25,950
thoughtless...

95
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:30,470
whatever it is you did to deserve
this punishment. That's just it!

96
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:33,720
We didn't DO anything. Mom said
we needed to build character.

97
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,510
YOUR character, right?

98
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:41,800
Well,... see that you do!

99
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:51,230
What are you doing? Trading again.
A backpack for a backpack.

100
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:54,990
Dewey, wait! A yo-yo
isn't equal to a GameBoy.

101
00:06:55,090 --> 00:07:00,630
What if I throw in my Mightyman.
OK, two toys for one seems fair.

102
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:05,750
Yeah. I mean, as long as what
we trade is equal, it seems...

103
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:08,550
Whoa... Check these out!

104
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:11,550
Is this fair?
Think of it this way...

105
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:16,760
When you add the value of the work
we're doing, we're still way ahead.

106
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,470
Where do I dump this?

107
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:37,230
Ya don't dump it! You take the
bucket, heat it to 190 degrees,

108
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:41,350
run it through the hair trap
and make gravy for dinner.

109
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:44,440
Re-use old filthy fat?!
DO YOU LIKE HAVIN' A JOB?!

110
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:53,830
Hey, Lavernia. I need some licorice,
some paper towels and a 6-pack
of beer. Sure, hon.

111
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:59,030
Oh, no. It took me six months
to get you paid off last time.

112
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:04,230
I'm outta your book for good.
Hard cash! Got it exactly!

113
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:05,950
Good enough.

114
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:10,910
Like a freshly
baked muffin. Only $8.

115
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:16,680
You gotta be kiddin'! Eight bucks
for a lil... Are those raisins?
Last ones till spring.

116
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,550
Quit starin' at my
caboose - back to work!

117
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:32,880
Hey, you don't have
to snarl at us everyti-

118
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:43,710
High school's brutal! Don't get this
much homework in other classes.

119
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:48,230
They just keep heaping it on!
Is Monday OK? Make it Friday.

120
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:53,830
I don't wanna ruin your weekend.
Oh. I lost the crystal off my watch.

121
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:57,950
Your parents gave you that.
There's one like this at the church.

122
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:03,230
Could you get it for me?
If you donate something of equal
or greater value.

123
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:07,350
How about aftershave? Mom got it
for me for parties and dances.

124
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:12,270
Poor deluded woman! Sold. You
wouldn't believe the stuff they got.

125
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:14,270
Clothes, toys, comics...

126
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:18,790
Yesterday a guy donated an old
Nintendo - the Double Dragon 4 game.

127
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:21,790
DD4?! The... Sacred... Stone?

128
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:23,790
Yeah, why?

129
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:25,890
I give you... $20 for it.

130
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,190
Money?

131
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:32,950
I guess we could put it
in the collection box.

132
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:37,110
This is great! The church
is only charging $5 for it.

133
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:42,710
This way Stevie gets his game
and the church gets an extra $10.
No, the church gets an extra $15.

134
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:45,670
I think we deserve something
for our trouble.

135
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:50,550
Think of it this way... The church
gets three times what it asked for.

136
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:53,190
Yeah. We're makin'
this work for everyone.

137
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:58,350
Any porcelain tea sets? NOT for me,
of course. For my sister.

138
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:02,310
Isn't she at Vassar? Look,
do you want the cash or not?!

139
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:07,230
"..and my job in Alaska is great -
making tons of money and friends."

and exploitation were, as always,

Oh, he's a good boy.
They're all good kids.

142
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:20,040
Mrs Potts at the church
says they're a godsend.

143
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,310
Whoah, whoah...!
Where are you off to?

144
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:28,160
We told Mrs Potts we'd be back after
lunch. Charity's fun. Thanks, Mom!

145
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:34,680
Well, whaddaya know! Are we finally
getting something right with them?

146
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,920

This is ridiculous! The wolves
had me tree-ed for half an hour.

I've just about- OW!

YOU CAN'T TREAT US LIKE THIS!

155

This is inhuman! We are
citizens! This is America!

156
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,150
Isn't it?
I'm sorry, Francis.

157
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:16,190
It's all my fault.

158
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:18,230
Stop crying.

159
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:21,070
It's OK, man.
No, it isn't!

160
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:25,270
God, you must hate me.
Come on...! You're my friend.

161
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:27,370
I can't hate YOU!

00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,240
Er, sorry.

164
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,510
Thought I's pickin' up the vibe.

165
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:46,270
Look, Lavernia may be evil,
and she may be tough,

166
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:48,510
but we can beat her.
How?

167
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:51,510
Our lives our controlled
by that ledger book.

168
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:56,310
Everything we do increases our debt.
This is what military school was for

169
00:16:56,410 --> 00:17:00,190
To wage war against all authority
no matter what the odds.

170

She may be a manipulative monster,
but Mom can't win every round.
Who? Lavernia!

171
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:11,190
We gotta get her where she lives.
We gotta get that book!

172
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:14,030
I HATE that book.

173
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:17,990
Know what book I hate?
Valley of the Dolls.

What kind of ending was that?

OK, Stevie wants Pam Grier
memorabilia. IF he can keep it here.

176
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:31,390
If he's got the money,
the church doesn't care.

177
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:34,790
And the liquor store guy
will take the breadmaker.

178
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:40,510
Hey, we're up to $159! What
shall we buy?
I say we buy a saddle.

179
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:44,110
Then they can't say no to
the horse. I don't WANT a horse!

I say we vote. Dewey?
Can God see everything we do?

181
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:54,070
What? Mrs Potts said
God sees everything we do.

182
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:57,160
Yeah, Dewey. God can magically
see through roofs.

183
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:04,110
What are you worried about?
We're not doing anything wrong.
Then how come we have money?

184
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:09,560
Well,... sometimes when you do good
things, good things happen for you.

Satisfied?

186
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:15,990
I mean, think of
it this way, Dewey,

187
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:18,670
people are still
getting what they need.

188

OK, we DO have some money, but
the church does, too, so no-one's
getting hurt an- (NOISE OUTSIDE DOOR)

189
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:45,510
This is bad. Once we get
the saddle, we should just quit.

190
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:48,830
We're not getting the saddle!
This was ALL a mistake!

191
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:53,790
I should've KNOWN something was wrong
when YOU started making sense.
This is YOUR fault!

192
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:56,630
You're supposed to keep us
OUT of trouble!

193
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:59,590
So YOU'RE going to hell!
We're ALL going to hell!

You guys seen
the remote for...

What's going on? Dad,
we've done something terrible.

196
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:13,310
It might be the worst thing
we've ever done. Just calm down.

197
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:16,240
Let's talk this through.
It can't be that bad.

198
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:21,430
You've been stealing money
from the CHURCH!

199
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:24,640
And maybe some... merchandise.

200
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,560
You boys, you've been taking
stereos,... toys...

201
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,030
Is that cheese?

202
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:39,130
Oh... god...

203
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,270
ARGH!

204
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:50,070
My god...!
Dewey, get a washcloth!

205
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:52,170
Here you go, Dad.

206
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,720
Nice and even.

207
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,030
You stole... AIR?!

208
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:10,630
WHAT IS WRONG
WITH YOU BOYS?

209
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:16,510
Do you EVER stop and think of the
consequences of ANYTHING you do?!

210
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:20,830
Do you realise the SHAME
you'll bring on the family? DO YOU?!

211
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:24,030
Forget THAT,
what's MOM gonna say?!

212
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:29,270
Right, we sneak this back into the
church, and no-one will ever know.

213
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:33,790
The church left us alone with
all that stuff. It was entrapment!

214
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:39,790
Reese, no more excuses!
(ENGINE MAKES ODD NOISE) Oh, damn!

215
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:42,590
IT'S GOD, HE FOUND US!

216
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:45,950
It's not God, Dewey.
It's just my crappy car.

217
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:50,070
Although he COULD have
helped out in my career a bit,

218
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:55,350
thrown a promotion MY WAY
once in a while. Maybe it IS God!

219
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:59,040
This is the street mum drives down,
and she finishes work in TEN MINUTES!

220
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:11,110
You, sir, a shirt? Three shirts.
Some pants? You'd be a 34 waist?

221
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:13,510
Look, I don't want these!
Why not, they're free!

222
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:19,790
What's wrong with them? Nothing!
Oh, look, just gimme five bucks!
Alright.

223
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:23,390
What's going on? This guy's selling
me all this for five bucks.

224
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:25,630
I'll give you
five for that.

225
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:30,590
OK, gather round. I've
got a good-as-new stereo.

226
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:35,830
Who's next?
I am. This your stuff?

227
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:39,790
I know how this must look, but
I didn't steal any of these things.

228
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:42,240
My boys took 'em from a church.

229
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:54,240
Neither one of you nimrods leave
until that grill is spotless.

230
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:03,230
And after that, get that jar
of poison and bait the rat traps.

231
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:07,550
That doesn't make sense.
Why poison them if we have traps?

232
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:09,960
Because I'll fire your ass!

233
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:24,950
Perfect. Nice job
with the tape! Thanks.

234
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:30,230
Most people put the tape on too
tight so you lose that nice clang.

235
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:33,670
Everyone hates her so much,
they'll never pin it on us!

God, look at this next to my name -
emotionally dependent on pornography,
loves nut clusters.

237
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:41,240
How does she know
I love nut clusters?!

238
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,550
Took the tape
off the door.

239
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:56,960
You dragged me to Alaska.
Nnnrrrrrrgg...! Aarrrnnnnng...!

you three hours ago!

I am not at liberty to reveal that.
"BUS NO.23 FOR OMAHA NOW BOARDING."

247
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:38,550
Hal, you're a middle-aged man,
you CAN'T run away from home!

248
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:42,510
I have a credit card that begs to
differ! Hang up! She's tracin' it!

249
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:47,030
DON'T YOU HANG UP THAT PHONE!
Hal,... you're not gonna do this.

250
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:50,190
You and the boys are
gonna come home right now.

251
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:55,360
Why would I do that? Because
you love me too much
to run away.

252
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:04,910
That may... may be true, Lois.

253
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:10,190
But maybe we'll just have a long
distance relationship for a while.

254
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:12,350
Some of those can work.

255
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:18,790
Hal, have you even thought what
you'd be like without me? Well, no..

256
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:23,280
Do you have any idea how much
you'd miss me? Do you?

257
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,390
Yes...

258
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:32,350
Yes. I... I have some idea.
Dad, you're folding!

259
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:37,630
He's folding! I knew we should've
paid that wino to make the call.

260
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:40,070
Er, honey?

261
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:42,590
We're back.

Hey, guys. Why don't
you wash up, dinner's ready.

OK. Great.

265
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,720
Why isn't she mad?

266
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:08,630
What happened? Our stuff is gone!
I gave it all to charity.

267

problem. No, fine. No, no.

Please.

270
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:26,230
So, how long is it gonna take us
to work off all this stuff?

271
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:29,560
Well, this... should put
us into the 23rd century.

I don't know much, just that he's
this all powerful, all knowing being.

275
00:25:56,610 --> 00:26:01,630
Kinda like Mom, only invisible.
So I feel better on his good side.

276
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:06,360
And we probably all focus
too much on material things.

What are you doing? Praying.
No you're NOT! He's got chocolate!
