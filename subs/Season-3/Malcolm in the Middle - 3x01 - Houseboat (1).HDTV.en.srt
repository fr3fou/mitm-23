No. The ones you picked out
are too big and baggy.

19
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:06,030
Baggy is good. It's less
surface area I have to shave.

I like the little ones.
No. You always pop out.

21

I do not. That was one time. The
Kenarbans are conservative people.

We'll be in very close quarters
with them. Get the baggy ones.

but I'm telling you... Malcolm!

your father came to being

understand what I did.

It's the worst thing I've ever done.

We both agree I'm
a terrible person.

Who wouldn't even give you the time
of day! That's your gratitude?!

good one after all.

I mean, it's not like I
shoved him in the squad car.

not right now. I'm kinda busy.

Sure, Dad. I love to be helpful.

Can you close the door?

Absolutely not, Francis!

You are going to graduate
from high school.

77
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:08,950
Why spend the tuition? It's a waste
of money. We both know I'm failing.

78
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:11,110
OK, now we both know.

79
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:16,270
Francis, you are going to stay
in school until you graduate
and that's all there is to it.

80

you'll do another year!

honey. You should have asked me to.

No problem. I'll just
create one out of newspaper.

(TUTS) I brought you something.

153
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:59,430
What's that?
A hammer.

154
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:04,070
I expect you to repair the case.
You'll find lumber in the common
room.

155
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:06,870
I have a nine-inch
gash in my leg! Hmm...

156
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:09,430
That's quite a handicap.

157
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:12,590
Cadet, you damaged school property!

158
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:15,710
You are the one responsible
for repairing it.

159
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:18,550
Consider it a
character-building lesson.

160
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:21,670
I didn't damage anything.
That was negligence.

161
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:25,150
The phone wasn't properly connected
to the wall! It's unfair!

162
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,910
I decide what's
fair around here.

163
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:30,750
But wait. Maybe
I've been hasty.

164
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:34,510
No. Now that I've reconsidered,
the decision stands.

165
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:37,840
You will fix the damage by the end
of the week. That is all, Cadet.

166
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,710
Dewey, you have to let go of
the rope. You're all sunburnt. No.

167
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:50,990
Just let go. It's gonna be
dark soon. I can't.

168
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:53,790
Yes, you can.
Just open your fingers.

169
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:58,110
But I'll fall. That's the point.
Dewey, don't think, just do it.

170
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:02,070
Just let go! No!
Oh, for crying out loud!

171
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:05,630
You let go of that rope
and you come in for dinner!

172
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:08,790
Come on, honey!
No. Ow!

173
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:10,670
I'll make French fries.
Ow!

174
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:15,630
Your favourite. Ice cream.
You know you love ice cream.

175
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:20,070
And it was wriggling and fighting.
And finally I got it on the hook.

176
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:24,470
That was one helluva worm. I was
sure I'd catch something with it.

177
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:26,570
Dewey, pass the salt, please.

178
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:33,750
Where'd you get
that shiner? Mom...

179
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:38,720
It was horrible. It was like we were
there for hours. It was so boring.

180
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,950
What are you smiling about?
I like these potatoes.

181
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:50,990
You guys went to the camp?
Oh, man. What was it like?

182
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:55,550
Imagine 100 fat guys fallin'
downstairs knocking over old ladies.

183
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:59,550
Multiply that by 10
and you're not even close.

184
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:01,590
Until... today...

185
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:05,310
..I'd have traded... my life...

186
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:08,400
..for anybody's...

187
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:13,070
No way. It's Mom's.

188
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:15,110
If it were Mom's,

189
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:17,210
would I do this?

I am so sorry about Abe.

Oh, you're sweet to pretend,

194
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:37,110
but I know he's ruining the vacation
with his pouting and sarcastic
little digs.

195

If it's bothering you, talk to him.
(SIGHS) Sure is a beautiful night.

Anything is better than this!

I hate this boat, I hate this place
and everything about this vacation!

200
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:07,070
Then, why didn't you say anything?
What difference would it have made?
This trip was your idea!

201
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:13,470
And God knows, whatever Kenny wants,
Kenny gets!
Stop behaving like a total ass!

They can't afford that.
Pardon me for going to
college and earning a decent living!

204
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:26,310
Should I drive a crappy car
cos they do, too?!

205
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:29,070
They cannot hear me!

206
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:35,030
And even if they could,
they'd understand it's
just my puckish sense of humour.
