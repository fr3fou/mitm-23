a rocket ship must attain speeds

that fast they'd be squashed

You're confusing acceleration
with velocity. You feel it at first,

5
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:20,390
but once you're up to speed,
you don't notice. Right now

we're on a planet spinning at
1,000mph. That's rotational velocity.

wants something he really likes.

on time it wouldn't happen.
