Thanks. What does that mean?

What's wrong with the way I kiss?

61
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:41,390
Are my lips too wet? Maybe they're
too dry. I don't see why she couldn't
just return the compliment!

OK, just calm down.
I'm a good boyfriend.

She wouldn't be my

You don't understand. All I did
was take a doughnut out of a
dumpster. How is that stealing?

I had to fight a cat to get it!

wants to press charges.

Look, I know the guy. He's a bit of
a hothead, but I promise you he'll
lose interest in four or five days.

69

Four or five days? I have to start

you could use some home cooking.

00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:25,070
What would you like for dinner,
chicken or a nice porterhouse steak?

00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:28,910
Porterhouse, I guess. Oh,
you're gonna love her cooking!

Shelby had filled it out
thinking it was a 4-28.

00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:53,270
This isn't interesting, is it?

78
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:57,310
No, it is! You just need to know
what a 4-25 form is!

00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:00,030
You see - Dewey,
how was your day?

00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:02,870
I got a new friend,
his name's Ronnie.

00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:08,990
He just moved here.
He's got a Nintendo, a Playstation,
and a nanny. He's really rich.

82
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:11,590
Well, nice to
meet you, Ronnie.

83
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:15,390
No, he's real! I can
make real friends, too!

84
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:20,350
Of course. Don't be frustrated if
it takes you longer than other boys.

girlfriend! What?

00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:34,190
Son, is this true? Damn! I was
saving that for report card day!

00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:37,790
She's not... We're just friends.
Malcolm, look at me!

90
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:43,470
Oh, my God, it's true! Malcolm, no!
You do not do this yet!

91
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:47,270
I saw them behind the 7-11 French
kissing. That's with tongue.

92
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:51,110
Don't you wanna go to college?
Don't you care about your future?

between homework and some tramp!

before I kissed my...

How old are you? Never
mind. What I'm saying is,

96

for some kissing.. Who is this girl?

a big deal outta this!

100
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:21,910
I knew this is exactly how you'd
react! This is none of your business!

101
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:25,680
It's nobody's business!
It's not a big deal, OK?

00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,720
Well, it's not. I would appreciate it
if we could just drop it.

Ow!

106
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:47,910
Hm! Interesting!

107
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:50,320
We'll be in my room.

108
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:58,590
I can't believe how much stuff
you have. You wanna play cowboys?

No, I hate cowboys.
You can have 'em.

empty the dishwasher for Mommy?

here, you could help me. OK.

you do for your birthday parties?

What are we celebrating?

119
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,590

three, four, five.

120
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:47,360
Damn it! You get
back in here now! I won't!

121
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:53,910
Sorta. I was thinking Ronnie would
like a Starwars theme for his party.

122
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:56,630
No, do cowboys!
What?

123
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:59,710
Cowboys. He likes cowboys
better than Starwars.

124
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:02,920
OK, that'll be
fun. Thank you, Dewey.

Oh, Brock! What is it?
You're trembling, what's wrong?

126
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:16,430

127
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:22,430
You know he's been asking questions
at the orphanage. We need to get out
of here! Say goodbye to the money?

128
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:29,270
We just need to bide our time.
How can I trust you, Brock, when you
haven't told Cassandra about us yet?

He thinks he's gonna kill
our little real estate deal.

133
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:48,550
What about the pictures of him and
the Hastings girl? They're on their
way to the newspapers right now.

134
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:52,310
Perfect! Now all we have
to worry about is old man Landers.

135
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:55,990
Maybe we should send Largo
to pay him a little visit.

What a mess!

138
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:07,910
Mr Hirkaby just called. He said you
got Cs in your last tests and you
didn't turn in your history paper.

139
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:11,310
I warned you! This has
nothing to do with Sara!

140
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:13,760
I just forgot.
I'm doing it now, OK?

141
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,430
So, what kind of
socks are you wearing?

142
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:25,430
Yeah, I like those.
Which shoes are you wearing?

143
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:28,430
Not the sneakers?
How about your boots?

144
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:32,430
Your sandals! God, I
totally love all your shoes!

145
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:35,230
Yeah, I guess I
have homework to do, too.

146
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:37,630
You hang up first.

00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,580
Excellence gives you
sensational colour

153
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,420
and really cares for your hair.

154
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,140
With the new comb,
it's so much easier.

155
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,980
Combs in rich,
radiant colour.

156
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,660
Combs in advanced protection.

157
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,920
Combs out every last grey.

158
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,980
My hair feels so soft

159
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,700
and the colour
looks truly natural.

160
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,800
New, improved:

161
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,580
It's the
hair colour

162
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,700
that makes me
feel younger.

163
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,800
We're worth it.

164
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,920
Get great results
all around your home

165
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:10,860
when you try

166
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,900
new Cillit Bang Multi Power.

167
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,380
It was so quick and easy.

168
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,300
Look how it cleans this toothpaste

169
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,020
and my make-up
stains. What a shine!

170
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,380
And a new fresh smell.

171
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,220
For taps clogged
with limescale...

172
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,740
Look, it's amazing.

173
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,420
Clean as a whistle.

174
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,700
It also works
in the kitchen

175
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,380
and gets rid of cooking spills

176
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,900
with so little effort.

177
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:29,820
For great results

178
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,940
all around your home.

179
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:31,820
Try it now!

180
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,520
Cillit Bang Grime & Lime
Multi Power.

181
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,300
And no more tedious scrubbing

182
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,980
with Cillit Bang Grease & Floor.

183
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,420
The new
all-purpose cleaner

184
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,520
that gives great results
on large surfaces

185
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:43,660
and even
when used neat.

186
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,760
Cillit Bang
Grease & Floor.

187
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:20,550
This is all your fault.
You bought him that acne medicine.

188
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:23,630
I thought we were safe.
He's still goofy-looking.

189
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:26,430
His head is five times
too big for his body.

190
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:30,230
We shouldn't have to worry about
this with Malcolm. He's gifted.

191
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:34,070
Girls shouldn't be interested
until he's 28 and a billionaire!

192
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:40,350
Certain things are beyond
the boy's control. It's his
genetics. Girls, they just swoon.

193
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:44,350
Sorry, what am I telling your for?
You battle with it every day.

194
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:47,350
There's nothing we can do.
Oh, yes, there is!

195
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:51,510
I can ground him, and I can ground
him till he graduates from Harvard.

196
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:56,390
He's gonna pull away, then we'll
have another Francis on our hands.

197
00:15:56,490 --> 00:16:00,310
Are you blaming Francis on
me? No! That's what you said!

198
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:06,320
No, I meant that... Lois, let's not
have this veer off into us
somehow not having sex tonight.

199
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,110
Oh, God!

200
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:12,630
Why do they do this to us?

201
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:15,590
Why can't they learn
from their mistakes?

202
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:18,390
Even if they're just
being stupid on purpose.

203
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:21,230
Seems like the
only logical conclusion.

204
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:26,230
When they're grown we don't
have to let them visit, do we?
Absolutely not.

205
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:31,230
It's just gonna be you and me,
old and shrivelled
in a big empty house.

206
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:35,630
The only sound a gentle
sucking of the respirator.

207
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:39,470
And all our money will be sitting
in the bank, helping no-one.

208
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:41,570
Mmmmm!

209
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:48,590
You guys seen Sara?
No.

210
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:51,070
That's weird.
She's two minutes late.

211
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:55,230
Were you supposed to meet her here?
No, not exactly. But it was implied.

212
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:57,270
Implied?

213
00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:03,070
We meet at the water fountain at
eight. We're always within 30 seconds
of each other in the lunch line.

214
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:07,070
When I get home I wait four minutes
before I call. That's how it's been.

215
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:11,640
That's our thing. Wow! I didn't know
having a girlfriend was so creepy!

216
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,590
It's not creepy! This is totally
normal! This is dating!

217
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:20,390
You spend time with each other,
get to know each other's habits.

218
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:23,230
When you're in a relationship
you'll understand.

219
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:26,510
I'll just hang out
outside the bathrooms.

220
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:29,310
Hi, Mrs Demarco.
Sorry to bother you,

221
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:32,310
but the nanny put too
much banana in my smoothie.

222
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:35,750
Oh, we'll fix that.
I just booked the cowboy!

223
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:39,550
He's gonna be passing out cowboy hats
and making balloon animals.

224
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:43,350
Does he do trick shooting? I'm
sure we can find someone who does.

225
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:46,320
I bet Ronnie would
like a moonbounce, too.

226
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,190
This relationship is
finally starting to make sense.

227
00:17:56,290 --> 00:18:01,230
For a while all we did is fight and
make out, then fight, then make out.

228
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:07,830
But that's all behind us. We were
screaming at each other five minutes
ago. Now it just feels so right.

229
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:10,790
Wait, what are you doing?
Where are you going?

230
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:14,910
Home. We've been kissing
for two hours, my face is sore.

231
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:18,550
Yeah, she's right.
We can't make out all day.

232
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:22,030
We've both got our own
things to do. She's so smart.

233
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:25,630
If you're seeing someone else
just tell me! What?!

234
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:28,630
I-I'm sorry. I don't
know where that came from.

235
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:31,070
Look, I've gotta go home.

236
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:33,960
I'll call you tonight.

237
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,960
That was pathetic!

238
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:42,550
You were watching us?
Believe me, it's the last time!

239
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:48,350
Just because you have a girl doesn't
mean you should act like one.
I don't know what's wrong with her!

240
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:51,790
She's driving me crazy!
I freak out 20 times a day!

241
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:55,390
Dude, you think about everything
too much. Calm down.

242
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:58,190
Turn off your brain.
It's not that easy.

243
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:01,190
Sure it is. I do it
all the time. Watch.

244
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:04,950
You can't just
turn off your... Reese!

245
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:08,750
Reese!
Whoa! How long was I out?

246
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:13,390
And as I pulled her
from the wreckage,

247
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:15,910
she was so...

248
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:21,110
(TEARFULLY)
..disfigured that I didn't even know
it was my own sister.

249
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:27,070
Don't worry. Dimitri is the finest
reconstructive surgeon in the state.

250
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:29,350
Who's Dimitri?

251
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:33,270
They had a municipal hospital. He
and Vanessa had an affair last year -

252
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:35,760
Shut up in there!

253
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,590
Oh, man, who's got their assignment
on Cambodia? I need to borrow it.

254
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:45,110
Where were you... last night?
What?

255
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:49,670
The Space 1999 marathon
on the Sci Fi channel.

256
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:52,710
I made you a tunic
and a hologram badge.

257
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:56,310
I-I'm - Forget it! I
gave it to my mom's boyfriend!

258
00:19:56,410 --> 00:19:59,790
Thanks for nothing!
Guys, look, I'm sorry.

259
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:03,470
I've just been... Sara
and I were on the phone...

260
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:05,840
Never mind. I'm just sorry.

261
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,270
I promise this
won't happen again.

262
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:14,070
I think I turned a corner
on this thing.

263
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:17,400
Sara and I were talking
and it just came to me.

264
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:22,190
I think we worked things out.

265
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:25,360
Can you guys excuse me?
I'll be right back.

266
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,390
He does seem... sorry.

267
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:33,790
I say we cancel
our vote of censure.

268
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:38,310
I second that. He was there for us
after the arboretum broke down.

269
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:42,550
And how can you look in those eyes
and say no to anything he asks?

270
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:45,110
(BOTH SIGH)

271
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:48,440
I think... he's
learned... his lesson.

272
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:56,310
OK, only two invitations left.

273
00:20:56,410 --> 00:21:00,110
Ronnie's gonna have a moonbounce
and a make-your-own-sundae car.

274
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:04,390
I'll go. Maybe you will. What
kind of present would you bring?

275
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:06,870
Skateboard?
Excellent choice!

276
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:11,520
Ronnie has a brand new skate board.
Why don't you let ME
worry about Ronnie?

277
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,830
Sit!

278
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:17,310
Look at yourself!

279
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:20,710
They've put you on
probation. Probation!

280
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:24,830
If you do just one more thing wrong
they're gonna kick you outta school!

281
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:28,790
Do you have any idea how serious
this is? Is this who you wanna be?

282
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:32,390
You wanna be a lap dog
who ruins his life for some girl?

283
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:36,190
For God's sake, Malcolm, you beat up
a foreign exchange student!

284
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:39,870
He left his country to get
away from this kind of abuse!

285
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:42,910
Are you listening to me?
Yes, I'm listening!

286
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:46,630
But I've got bigger problems!
You may not have noticed,

287
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:50,430
but I've been screwing up a lot.
All because of some stupid girl!

288
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:54,430
I'm on probation! I beat up a kid
who doesn't even speak English!

289
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:58,400
I'm going through a lot
and you don't even care!

290
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,790
We can still pull this off!

291
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:08,070
You'll never pass the DNE test,
and even your lies won't be enough.

292
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:12,040
But Brock, if you didn't buy
the mining rights, then who did?

293
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:19,150
Don't you see? The person who bought
the mining rights is the same person
who stole Mrs Bronson's brooch.

294
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:23,110
And the person who ran Nathaniel's
car off the road that night.

295
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:26,510
That person's name is -
OK, you're free to go.

296
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:28,910
Ssh!
Come on, move it!

297
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:31,430
Just five more
minutes! Wait! No!

298
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:34,430
It was the Mayor, right?
Or the widow Farthington?

299
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:39,430
What about the creepy janitor?
No, his amnesiac brother! Argh!

(BELL RINGS)

301
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:45,430
I didn't understand one word
that was said in the last six hours.

302
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:48,470
I'm exhausted. I
couldn't sleep all night.

303
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:54,510
I finally figured out
what I gotta do. Sara! Wait up!

304
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:58,910
Look, I've done a lot of
thinking and we need to talk.

305
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:01,750
Sara, this just isn't working.

306
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:05,550
Since I've known you I've been
nothing but obsessive and neurotic.

307
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:08,030
A jealous creep
who's way too clingy.

308
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:13,990
I don't like what this is turning me
into, so I got you this pager.

309
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:18,670
What? It's perfect. Now we know
where the other one is every second.

310
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:22,470
No more worry or doubt.
We'll be able to trust each other.

311
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:24,920
We have to break up, Malcolm.

312
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:28,390
I don't think
you heard me.

313
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,870
I'm proposing
the exact opposite.

314
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:33,350
That's what the pager's for.

315
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:35,920
I'm sorry. Bye.

316
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:41,070
No!

317
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:43,470
No! No!

318
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:45,570
Sara!

319
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:50,070
You can't break up with me!

320
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:53,910
Because I am filled with nothing
but love and good feelings!

321
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:59,950
And no anger and no jealousy! And
none of those things that will lead
you to not wanting to be with me!

322
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:04,790
OK, fine! Get outta here!
I don't need you! I hate your guts!

323
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:07,110
I never needed
you! No, no, no, no!

324
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:11,430
I love you! I
always have, I always will!

325
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:13,870
We were meant
to be together!

326
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:17,390
I gave you my soul, Sara!

327
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:19,790
I gave it to you, my soul!

328
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:21,990
My soul!

329
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:24,240
Sara!

330
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,550
There you go, sweetheart.

331
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:45,350
I always thought
you hated cookie dough.

332
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:48,110
So, are you having a
good time? Yeah, Mom. Thanks.

333
00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:52,880
You really should help Dewey.
He was a big help in planning this.

334
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,550
You ruined by
birthday! I hate you!

335
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:05,560
I've had two sundaes
and four snow cones.

336
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,870
Malcolm, look.
Come on. Come on.

337
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:13,390
I can't feel my fingers.

338
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:16,760
I'll go get us some punch,
how's that sound?

339
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:22,590
You know, son, this is
all part of growing up.

340
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:25,960
You're just gonna
have to get used to it.

341
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,470
No, I don't.

342
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:35,760
I can go back.

343
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,200
I can go back!

344
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:47,910
What are you doing?
I'm gonna play.

345
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:50,950
You can't! You're
too big! No, I'm not.

346
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:56,000
I'm going back. No, you're too big!
You're going to ruin my party!

347
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,910
# Party day

348
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:04,310
# Sleeping our cares away

349
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:07,150
# On our way

350
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:11,600
# to where the air
is sweet # (LOUD BANG)

351
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,990
OK! Don't panic! OK!

352
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:33,360
OK! Hah!

353
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:41,560
Yeeeargh! You're
OK! Don't be scared!

354
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:51,510
Oh! Don't be afraid, son.
It was just a loud explosion.
Everything is going to be OK.

355
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:54,240
Don't be afraid.
(HIGH PITCHED WHISTLE)

356
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:02,550
Just once I'd like to learn
without something exploding.

357
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:05,640
# That's how the West was won #
