1
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,510
Mmm, I'm starving.
What's for dinner?

2
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:28,070
Leftover parfait.

3
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:32,310
It's even worse than it sounds! Once
a week Mom cleans out the fridge.

4
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:36,280
Anything that doesn't have something
growing on it gets served for dinner.

5
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,080
Did we have spaghetti or
Chinese food on Thursday? Neither.

6
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,640
Ah! No digging!

7
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,870
(SQUELCHING)

8
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:52,480
Sunday, Saturday, Friday.

9
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:57,510
It finally happened! The fifth level
of this week's leftover parfait...

10
00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:00,190
is last week's
leftover parfait!

11
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:03,670
# Yes, no, maybe

12
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:06,190
# I don't know

13
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:09,550
# Can you repeat the question?

14
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:11,800
# You're not the boss of me now

15
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,710
# And you're not so big

16
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:21,160
# You're not the boss of me now

17
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,510
And you're not so big

18
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:32,120
# Life is unfair #

19
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:37,510
Alright, everyone, these
are your secret-shopper evaluations.

20
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:42,640
I'm going to be meeting with each one
of you this week so we can discuss...

21
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:47,320
..how we can make improvements.
Look forward to it, sir!

22
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,870
Secret shoppers?
They had people spy on us?

23
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:56,070
What's next? Cavity searches on
the loading dock?! It's no big deal.

24
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:00,270
Companys do this kind of thing
all the time. But it's not fair!

25
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:04,310
How can I work hard if I don't
even know they're watching me?!

26
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:06,750
Calm down. It's,
like, a paragraph.

27
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:11,310
"Employees seem capable, efficient.
Personal hygiene was questionable."

28
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:14,750
Questionable?! What are they
talking about? My hy...

29
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:16,850
"Slovenly"?!

30
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,150
They think I'm slovenly?
You're right. This is ridiculous!

31
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:26,470
"Apathetic, lazy, overweight."
What planet are these people from?

32
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:28,760
I'm taking a fiver.

33
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:34,950
There's electricity in the air
tonight, folks! I'm open, I'm open!

34
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:39,950
We've been playing basketball with
Dad since we could walk. I'm open!

35
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:42,160
(LAUGHS) Oh!

36
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,390
Yes! Another basket for Hal!

37
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:48,590
He's on fire!

38
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:53,110
We're 0 and 342! We're starting
to get a little discouraged! (LAUGHS)

39
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:55,310
Game point!

40
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:57,870
You take it out.

41
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:02,590
This is our last chance.
What do we do? Give it to me!

42
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:07,400
Try another give-and-go. Dewey, go to
the basket and run around the pole.

43
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,590
Ooh! That's it!
Pass! I'm open!

44
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:16,470
Ooh, stolen by
the Halinator!

45
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:19,550
He shoots... He scores!

46
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:21,590
Hal-lelujah!

47
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:25,000
It was great game, boys.
Good hustle.

48
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:32,840
I hate this! If I wanted to be
humiliated, I'd take a math test!
Wait a minute. Look.

49
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:42,790
Yeah. Dewey, get away from that
ball! No. He's making baskets.

50
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:46,590
He's never been able
to do that before. You're right.

51
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:50,440
That's how we're
gonna beat Dad - with Dewey.

52
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,270
Which one of you filthy thieves
has been rooting through my undies?

53
00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:00,070
What are you talking about?
One of you went through my locker!

54
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:03,950
And ate all my jerky! It wasn't us,
Artie. Looks like a rat did it.

55
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:09,150
Look at the teeth marks!
Don't jump to conclusions.
Think about it logically.

56
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:12,350
If the rat was so filled up
with Artie's jerky,

57
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:16,950
would he be chewing on Francis'
pillow right now? What?!

58
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:18,950
Get him!

59
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,430
Die, vermin!

60
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:23,530
(WHIMPERS)

61
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,800
(SQUELCH!)

62
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:36,240
Wow! Francis,
you killed it!

63
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,310
And it did eat your jerky.

64
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:46,710
We got your double bag
of paper and plastic.
The hair mousse is bagged separately

65
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:50,790
and I picked your film for you.
Can I take this to your car?

66
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:55,190
You don't have to do that. I insist.
That's my job here at Lucky Aide!

67
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:57,190
(LAUGHS)
Ooh!

68
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:59,520
(WHISPERS) Bend forward.

69
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:05,150
Hi, Lois. Mr Fisher, I wanted to talk
about that secret-shopper report.

70
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:09,150
I think they must've come in when my
son Dewey tried to cook breakfast.

71
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:13,040
By the time I put out the fire -
Lois, this isn't personal. It's...

72
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:18,990
It's not like I'm - Lois, there is
nothing for you to freak out over.

73
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:21,750
We have people
in the company

74
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:25,310
with the skills and
the experience to help you.

75
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:28,520
Wow, Lois! This is,
like, gonna be so fun!

76
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,040
OK, let's try
it one more time.

77
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,630
(LAUGHS) Yes! Perfect! Dad won't
have any idea what hit him!

78
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:48,360
He's going down! Do you think
he'll cry? Oh, yeah, he'll cry!

79
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:53,670
You have pretty eyes. You shouldn't
hide them behind no makeup.

80
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,990
This is wrong. I do
my job. I do my job well.

81
00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:00,750
I dress appropriately and
I'm clean. That should be enough.

82
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:04,070
Or you could be pretty!
Put your chin up.

83
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:08,550
What do they want? I have 3 kids, I
run a house, I work 38 hours a week

84
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:12,750
and they think I should look like a
model just to ring up rash ointment?

85
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:15,470
You tell me how that's fair.

86
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:18,270
Lois, it's OK
to be scared of change.

87
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:21,470
My boyfriend freaked
when I got my driver's licence.

88
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:25,070
Don't worry, I'll
take good care of you.

89
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:28,950
Oh, God, Hal! You wouldn't believe
what happened at work today!

90
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:34,070
I spent five hours with this stuff
on my face in front of everybody!

91
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:37,280
I've never been
so humiliated in all...

92
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,630
You're the most
beautiful woman that ever was

93
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:01,320
or ever could be!

94
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:08,270
Hey, Francis. I heard you killed
a rat yesterday. Is that right?

95
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:10,510
What?
Yes, sir, he did.

96
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:15,590
Good. I got a rat in my bunk. I'd be
obliged if you took care of it.

97
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:18,910
I don't think - He'd be
honoured. We both would.

98
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:21,350
Great.

99
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:25,870
What are you doing? I don't know
about killing rats! Who cares?!

100
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:30,080
You like mopping?! Do you wanna see
what comes in during bear season?

101
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,350
Baby, bring it on!

102
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:42,310
What? You think I'm scared of you?
I've changed your diapers!

103
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:44,410
Whoo-hoo!

104
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:51,160
Dewey, you made a basket!

105
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,840
Good for you!

106
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,630
Alright!
Yeah!

107
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:06,360
Yeah!
Yeah!

108
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,720
What are you lookin' at?

109
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,270
Sorry, son!

110
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:29,510
Hey!
Whoa!

111
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:32,840
Whoo! Rejected!

112
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:40,750
(LAUGHS) Good game, boys!

113
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:43,390
Good game?!
You fouled us!

114
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:47,030
Boys, part of the game is
learning how to lose gracefully.

115
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:50,760
If I've taught you anything
it's how to be a good sportsman.

116
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,270
I guess the rat could be coming out
of this hole. What are you gonna do?

117
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:04,920
We could try to lure him out.
Anyone have a cookie?

118
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:23,200
It worked! You did it!
I did.

119
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,270
Kill him!

120
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:28,680
< Go ahead.

121
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,630
(SMASH! SQUELCH!)

122
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:37,590
Yes! He did it!

123
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:39,990
That was amazing, Francis!

124
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:42,680
You have the gift!

125
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:49,390
Hi, Lois. Thought
I'd pick you up a latte.

126
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:51,490
Thanks.

127
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:57,750
What are you doing, Lois? You
shouldn't be lifting heavy boxes.

128
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:00,550
I always do it.
I'll take care of it.

129
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:02,950
Hold it a second.

130
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:06,150
You've watched me
lift boxes for four years.

131
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,550
Now you want to help me? Why?

132
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:12,990
I don't know. I just thought - No!
Look me in the face and tell me why!

133
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:17,320
I don't know. I'm sorry.
I'm just gonna go get lunch, OK?

134
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,440
Can I get you anything?

135
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:40,350
How did it go? Buzz, I don't wanna
bore you with the technical details,

136
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:45,070
so let's just say that cabin 15
is once again rodent free.

137
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:47,670
(ALL CHEER)

138
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:51,230
Three cheers for
Francis! Hip, hip! (ALL) Hooray!

139
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:54,040
What are you fools cheering about?!

140
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,920
You caught yourself a
couple of tiny rats. Whoopdee-dee!

141
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,870
You ain't nothing until you take out
a real rat. You ain't nothing

142
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:09,710
until you dance in the
moonlight with Rosemarie!

143
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:12,310
(SNIGGERS)
Who?

144
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:16,110
They ain't told ya
about Rosemarie, eh? (LAUGHS)

145
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:20,710
Well, she's the biggest, ugliest,
meanest rat north of Kotzebue!

146
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:25,390
Lives right here
under this here building!

147
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:27,750
Come on, Rosemarie ain't real!

148
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:30,630
Yeah, she's just
a creepy old myth.

149
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:33,870
Like Stonehenge
or boxing kangaroos.

150
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:36,550
She's as real
as you and me.

151
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:39,910
So, what do you say, Rat Boy?

152
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:43,510
You think you're
man enough? (LAUGHS)

153
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:48,440
Old man, you better start
building a very small coffin.

##

155
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:52,020
Fact - you can
immunise your family

156
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,780
against many infectious diseases.

157
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,500
But not the most common of all:

158
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,740
food poisoning,

159
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,260
often caught from raw meat

160
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,900
and the surfaces it touches.

161
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,860
But use Dettol
Surface Cleanser

162
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,320
to kill 99.9% of bacteria

163
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,440
wherever food
has been prepared

164
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,700
or stored,

165
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,800
without leaving a
taste in your mouth.

166
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,320
Dettol protects. Fact.

167
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,840
Dettol Handwash also kills harmful
bacteria on your hands. Fact.

168
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:45,360
You're looking at the
standard we set ourselves.

169
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:49,280
It's the one standard
that measures the shine,

170
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,340
the clarity

171
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,720
and the brilliance you get
with Finish Quantum.

172
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,980
It's only dishwashing,

173

the dish off from Dewey.

176
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,790
See? We just keep him with
the ball round the perimeter.

177
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:19,960
He can't cover all three of us,
no matter how dirty he plays.

178

my patented fall-away jump shot.

Hey, boys. What's up?
Not much. How's the leg?

189
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:11,870
A little better. It's interesting
how you happened to hurt your leg.

190
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:15,910
What does that mean? I
don't know. It's just interesting.

191
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:19,550
Yeah. Interesting.
What are you boys getting at?

192
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:22,750
Some people are willing to go
to drastic lengths

193
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:26,270
to avoid being beaten by their kids.
This is about basketball?

194
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:30,070
You think I faked this because I
didn't wanna play you in basketball?

195
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:33,870
Alright. You know what? I'm gonna
play you right now, like this,

196
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:37,910
and I'm still gonna mop the floor
with you. That's OK. You rest.

197
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:42,320
We can wait. Yeah. It's
gotta heal sometime, right?

198
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:49,150
Here you go! I had to move a couple
dozen bags of charcoal briquettes,

199
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:52,950
but I found the slightly-darker-blue
one that you wanted.

200
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:56,920
I got a few spider bites, but it's
OK as long as you go home satisfied.

201
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,990
You're welcome.

Excuse me! Where
are your dog toys?

203
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:07,550
Yes, ma'am. They're
right there. Right behind you.

Those are leashes. If I could direct
your attention three inches right...

I want that little hot dog
up on top.

Sure thing.

here. That isn't what I asked for.

since it's not even real mustard -

what I ask for? Certainly.

00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:56,520
Fact - most cleaners remove
dirt but could leave bacteria.

308
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:59,400
One bacteria could become
two million overnight.

309
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,340
So some things
that look clean...

310
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,940
aren't.

311
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,340
Dettol next
generation

312
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:07,800
All in 1 is unbeatable at
cutting through tough grease,

313
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,920
and powers through soap scum.

314
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,540
But, unlike ordinary cleaners,

315
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,720
it kills 99.9%
of bacteria,

316
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:18,800
leaving surfaces
clean and safe.

317
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,200
Dettol All in 1.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
