1
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:38,830
Leaving so soon, cadet? Sir, by
statute 614 of the Alabama Legal
Code I am officially emancipated

2
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:43,750
and considered an adult.
An adult who no longer chooses
to attend Marlin Academy.

3
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:49,830
I have copies of the documents
if you want to see them again.
Oh, no need!

4
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:53,150
I'm sure everything was
done on the up and up.

5
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:56,710
But let me tell
you something, cadet.

6
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:59,630
In all my years
at this academy

7
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:03,670
I have never had a student
who was more bull headed,

8
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:07,190
more committed to avoid
learning at all costs.

9
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:11,360
A cadet who's constant byword
was insubordination.

10
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,960
Thank you, cadet.
What?

11
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:22,190
Before you came to this academy
I was bored, uninspired,...

12
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:24,790
..and this close to retiring.

13
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:29,110
But your insolence and stupidity
have been the irritating grain

14
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:34,870
of sand around which has formed
the pearl of my renaissance.

15
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:39,000
I like me again. Cadet!

16
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44,510
As a thanks I
want you to have...

17
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:47,080
..this.

18
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:55,350
Normally these are reserved for
cadets who have distinguished
themselves or whose parents

19
00:01:55,450 --> 00:02:00,630
have donated a building but you've
left your mark here in your own way.
So, what the heck!

20
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:03,270
Wow! Sir,... this is great.

21
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:08,510
Farewell, cadet.
Thank you so much.

22
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:10,610
Careful that's razor...

23
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,120
# Yes, no, maybe

24
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,790
# I don't know

25
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:29,990
# Can you repeat the question?

26
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:32,160
# You're not the boss of me now

27
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,790
# And you're not so big

28
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:41,000
# You're not the boss of me now

29
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,880
# And you're not so big

30
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,760
# Life is unfair #

31
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:59,990
Normally I dread the first day of
school. Mum's been on such a rampage
about Francis it's a relief be here.

32
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:03,350
Thank God...

33
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:06,270
..summer's... over.

34
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:11,830
Hello, babies.
How's baby school, babies? Didn't
high school start a half hour ago?

35
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:14,670
If I'm on time they'll
expect it every day.

36
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:17,030
Ow! Ow! Ow!

37
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:22,950
Hi, Reese. This is Gus. He's in the
lead to replace you as school bully.

38
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:29,110
He gives a wedgie that'll knock your
socks off. I'm not just saying that
cos he's got me in a head lock.

39
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:35,040
Grab your wrist and stave your
fingers. You'll get better leverage.
You listen to him. He's the man.

40
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:43,200
I've completed the research on our
new teacher if anyone's interested.

41
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,950
Lionel Herkabe.

42
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:51,390
Born July 8th, 1963. Parents,
John and Ida. Notice anything?

43
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:55,230
He was a Krelboyne. We
won't have to talk down to him.

44
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:58,230
Finally, someone
who knows our pain.

45
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:03,550
Bentley. Gifted High. Princeton.
Harvard Business. Why's he teaching?

46
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:09,590
Well, there was some unpleasantness.
He quit a government think tank
to start a... dot.com.

47
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:12,990
(ALL GROAN) One time

00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:19,960
(GASPS) Here he comes!
Here he comes!

50
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:54,070
Who's Dabney?
Me, sir. I took the liberty of
ordering you a decaf soy latte.

51
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:59,870
Let me guess.
Emotionally needy. Closet bed-wetter.

52
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:05,870
You get no affection at home
so you'll be seeking it from me.
Look elsewhere, son.

53
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:09,230
Who's the anal-retentive outsider...

54
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:12,830
..with repressed
matricidal tendencies?

55
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:15,800
Yo, sir! Me, sir! Please, stop.

56
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,630
As you may or may not know I was
once one of you, a Krelboyne.

57
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:24,910
And I'm sure I would have made
the same lame attempt to ingratiate

58
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:28,750
myself to the new soft-headed
thick-wit teaching my class.

59
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:33,550
I've been there. I've been coddled
and preened. "Oh, you're a genius."

60
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:37,630
"You can do anything you set your
mind to. It must be easy being you."

61
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:40,470
Well, bull!
(ALL GASP)

62
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:44,350
All that gets you is an ex-wife
and 14 million dollars in debt.

63
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:48,910
I won't let you fall into the trap
society has set for you.

64
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:52,910
Playtime is over, children!
You've had a free ride so far.

65
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:58,310
It's time somebody challenged you,
tested your mental limits!

66
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:04,670
I don't have a teaching certificate
from a two-year community college
like most of the people I said hello

67
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:11,190
to this morning in the teachers
lounge but I'll muddle through with
my double doctorate from Harvard.

68
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:14,510
This is a test!
Correct. You have 20 minutes.

69
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:20,520
There are six essay questions.
I'm sorry, I thought this was
the gifted class. Begin!

70
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:39,030
Thanks for the ride. Are you sure
about this Alaska thing? Absolutely.

71
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:43,990
I heard Alaska's a hole. Are
you kidding?
Cruise ships go there!

72
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:48,270
For six weeks in the summer.
Isn't it dark the rest of the year?

73
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:54,270
I don't have to justify myself
to you or anyone.
That's why I got emancipated, OK?

74
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:58,350
OK. Good luck
with your parents.

75
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:02,790
Well, they had a week to think about
it. Let's see how they take it.

You ungrateful son of a...

79

This wasn't meant to hurt you!

80
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,190
All I'm saying is you can get your
diploma first then do what you want.

81
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:49,270
It's all about maximising your
options. Take in the long view.
(WINCES) Sorry about the closer.

82
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:54,870
Nonsense. I wouldn't have taught you
if I didn't want you to use it.
What do I always say?

83
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:58,350
The nards are fair game.
The nards are fair game!

84
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:03,550
Sometimes you're presented with
an opportunity you can't pass up.
Understand?

85
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:09,550
I'm not the one to worry about.
I know. I wanna get this straight
with mom. That's why I came here.

86
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:12,440
OK, then. Honey!

87
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:17,560
Your son has something
to say to you.

(BELL RINGS)

90
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,040
I have your test results.
You all got A's.

91
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:40,830
But, since this is the gifted
class, I also factored in...

92
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:46,440
..cogency of argument,
economy of language and penmanship,
which enabled me to do this.

93
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,950
What is that? A ranking board.
I thought you said we all got A's.

94
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:57,030
Oh, you did. But some of you
got better A's than others.

95
00:08:57,130 --> 00:09:00,710
But we all still
have A's? Of course.

96
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:04,430
So, er, what does being
number one get you? Nothing!

97
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:07,950
Just the knowledge that
you are number one.

98
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:10,960
Or that you are
not number one.

99
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,310
Yes, number five?
It's Dabney, sir.

100

I know. What is it
number five? I forgot.

101
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:25,670
What... a jerk. Is that what
we're gonna turn out like?

102
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:29,360
If I ever start acting like that
you have to promise to kill me.

103
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,710
No! No more death pacts.
Don't worry about it.

104
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:39,590
The only way that stupid board can
have an effect on us is if we let it.
Those numbers mean nothing.

105
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:42,750
What are... you doing?

106
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:45,800
Nothing!
You were studying?

107
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:50,670
No, I wasn't. My book
just fell open at this page.

108
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:54,110
You know... I'm
really not hungry.

109
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:57,360
I think I left my recess
stuff in my locker.

110
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,990
My God! High school is awesome! They
have an entire room for detention.

111
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:08,910
They put you in with juniors and
seniors. Some of them have records.

112

It's really inspiring.

their shoes in the living-room?

They're mine. Sorry. You're right,
you're sorry! Leaving your shoes
around like you don't care!

117
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:32,990
I hope you like walking to school
in your socks! I said sorry.

00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:35,990
I've heard sorry before!
I don't think so.

what we're gonna do.

to see you. I've missed you.

Emancipation? What, you're
divorcing the family now?

127
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:21,390
How could you do this to mom?
She left me no choice.

128
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:26,270
Ow! We've done a lot of bad things
to mom but we've never abandoned her.

129
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:31,070
I'm not abandoning her!
I'm just going to Alaska!
That's 5,000 miles away!

It is not... 5,000 miles? Are you
serious? Oh, my God! It's gonna take
me forever to get up there!

131
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:40,910
Then, don't go. Guys, I'm not doing
this to hurt anybody, I just...

132
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:45,150
I really think this is my best
chance to make something of myself.

133
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:49,670
Tell it to mom. I can't. She won't
talk to me. She's being so immature.

134
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:53,670

outside in the freezing cold.

Hey, would it be alright
if I slept in here tonight?

136

You do like your
whites, don't you?

137
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,100
Of course.

138

It's grey.

And look at this.
This stain's been washed in.

try Vanish Oxi

the difference in just one wash.

00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,500
Drop your stain
over this.

146
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,020
Look at it go!

147
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,060
This is good!

148
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,140
And it's perfect

149
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,460
for all your
washable whites.

150
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,700
She was right.

151
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,800
Vanish Oxi Action Crystal White.

152
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:40,870
Certainly the whale represents
the search for God.
But that could be limiting.

153
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:43,790
We could say it was
the search for the self.

154
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:47,440
Melville could be considered
a pre-existentialist.

155
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:56,720
You can't deny the whale could be
the search for truth which has been
a theme throughout his whole oeuvre.

156
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:07,630
You can't overlook the fact that it
is a whale which was the biggest
industry in the 19th century.

157
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:11,320
The oil was used in lamps,
soaps and even cosmetics.

158
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:18,270
Today whaling is outlawed but many
Aleutian islanders are legally

159
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:21,070
allowed to harvest whales for...

160
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:23,200
..ritual purposes.

161
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,560
But I digress! (SOBS)

162
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:34,880
Wow! Nine places.
That's gotta be a record.

163
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:42,710
OK, on to new business. This
Friday Principal Littledove will
be dropping by for an evaluation.

164
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:48,030
I think he'll be very impressed with
what he sees. I don't think he'll
understand it

165
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:53,350
but his tiny brain will have the dim
perception of the progress you can
make

166
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:56,470
when students are properly
motivated. (SOBS)

167
00:17:56,570 --> 00:18:00,600
Now, who would like to sink their
teeth into some Bernoulli equations?

168
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:10,990
Come on, guys. If we don't let the
rankings get to us they mean nothing!

169
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,430
Easy for you to
say, number one.

170
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:16,310
I have a name!
We all have names!

171
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:20,310
Oh, my God! I can't
remember mine! This is ridiculous!

172
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:25,870
School used to be the one place
where you were happy and Herkabe
has taken that away from you.

173
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:31,870
That stupid board is ruining our
lives! We can't let him do that!
What choice... do we have?

174
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:35,830
We have the choice that
people have had for centuries.

175
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:39,350
We can choose to fail.
Like the French?

176
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:41,750
You mean... we take...

177
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:45,190
..today's test?
No, we don't take it...

178
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,550
..we nuke it!

179
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:52,470
Every answer wrong! No complete
sentences! No punctuation!

180
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:56,190
And we use number
three pencils. (ALL GASP)

181
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:58,710
You can't rank zeroes.
Brilliant!

182
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:03,190
He'll have no choice but to throw
out his system. We'll be free!

183
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:05,560
(ALL CHEER)

184
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:13,390
I'm very disappointed in you.

185
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:15,880
Everyone else, nice job.

186
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,870
Sorry.
I'm sorry.

187
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:35,830
I tried. My hand
wouldn't let me.

188
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:39,270
I regret... nothing!

189
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:44,030
Interesting gambit but the lemmings
didn't follow you off the cliff.

190
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:49,750
When you spend some time in the real
world you realise you can't fight
the system. And now,...

191
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:52,400
..I'm the system.

192
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,160
(SIGHS)

193
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,630
Don't worry, I just let the air out.
We can talk while I put on your
spare.

194
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:19,390
I'm sorry I had to resort to this
but you have to give me five minutes
so we can talk.

195
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:22,750
(LOUD MUSIC) We can
talk over the music.

196
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:25,590
You can't drive on a flat!

197
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:28,880
You're gonna ruin your rims!

198
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,720
That was a red light!

199
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:39,710
You might want to notice my entire
opening paragraph is a palindrome.

200
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:43,800
You might want to
notice... my formatting.

201
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:56,110
What's this? Irrigation techniques
of pre Roman society and how they
helped advance western civilisation.

202
00:20:56,210 --> 00:21:00,430
I thought we were just studying
Mesopotamian farming. We were.

203
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:06,190
I used that as a start on how their
influences spread through the
Egyptians, the Carthaginians,

204
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:10,430
through the whole ancient world.
I think you'll be happy with this.

205
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:12,920
Very nice,... number 12.

206
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,030
It's nice to see a little
effort put forth

207
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:21,080
while some are content to do
the absolute minimum.

208
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,430
So,... he wants...

209
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:28,950
..to play. Ho-ho,
we'll play, alright.

210
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:31,840
What is it we're playing?

211
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,680
# "Pump It Up"
- Elvis Costello

212

# I've been on tenterhooks

OK. I think we're ready to show
Principal Littledove what motivation
can accomplish.

229
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:43,680
Well done, class.

230
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:55,040
You know, maybe we should just put
our heads down and take a rest for
a moment, shall we?

231
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:03,910
Yes? Did you know I can count
to a million by prime numbers?

232
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:07,310
I can, too!
So can I! It's easy!

233
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:11,230
That's not necessary.

You were right.
You can't beat the system.

But you sure can break it.

I love you guys. I'll write
you when I get there, OK?

00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:36,630
Someday when you come back and
you're unemployed
and have no place to live,...

251
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:39,830
..you can come
stay at my castle.

Thanks, bud.

He's leaving. He just wants to
talk to you. Just hear him out.

Lois! This has got to stop!

255
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:57,200
He's going very far away and you're
not gonna see him for a long time.

Honey, there are moments in life
that you just don't get back...

with this now it will haunt you for

Fine.

I know.

This is what you get
for the way you treated me!

267

I'm going to Alaska and
you'll be left without a son!

And the way you treated me is
now a matter of public record!
I treated you?!

I've sacrificed for you and you've
caused us nothing but pain!

You want pain? I've got your scars,

Oh! Maybe I should thank you?
Thank you for making my life hell!

Living hell? You've been a problem
since you were born! I'm outta here!
