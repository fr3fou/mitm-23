1
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,790
'< I can't believe you, Dewey!'
When is she going to stop?

2
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:22,510
I'm starving. Go
get us some food.

3
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:25,110
I'm not going out there.

4
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:28,110
'Sorry doesn't
cut it, young man.'

5
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:31,710
This was a good idea, just
wish you had told me earlier.

6
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:35,960
I was hiding outside for 45 minutes
before I came in. I saw you.

7
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,510
# Yes, no, maybe

8
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:42,950
# I don't know

9
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:46,190
# Can you repeat the question

10
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:48,310
# You're not the boss of me now

11
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:50,670
# You're not the boss of me
now

12
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:55,000
# You're not the boss of me now
and you're not so big

13
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,310
# You're not the boss of me
now

14
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:04,390
# You're not the boss of me now
and you're not so big

15
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:08,840
# Life is unfair #

16
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:19,270
You know how you've been hounding us
for years for your own computer?

17
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:22,430
We've arranged a deal
with Ed to get you one.

18
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:24,760
I'm giving you
my old laptop.

19
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,590
Is it inside that?
No, that's it.

20
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:33,070
In exchange you'll help
Ed set up his new computer.

21
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:36,990
Shouldn't be hard for you to
install sound and graphics cards

22
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:40,230
and set up a network
for my broadband connection!

23
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:44,310
You're gonna help him re-sod his
lawn and build a gazebo. What? No!

24
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:47,310
C'mon, boys, nothing
in this life comes free.

25
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:49,870
Oh, here are those Foreigner albums.

26
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:52,360
Pleasure doing
business with you.

27
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,830
Oh, just be glad
you're getting a computer.

28
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:00,270
I should get a dog or a rat,

29
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:04,590
some dumb animal that knows how
to work for a living. Yes, ma'am.

30
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:08,870
Damn idiots, never learned how to do
one damn thing right in your lives.

31
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:11,110
Yes, ma'am.

32
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:15,310
The blood from my knees was tracking
behind where I'd already scrubbed,

33
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:20,030
so I had to keep going around until
she let me put towels on my knees.

34
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:23,510
So, how was your day?
I don't care about that.

35
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:28,790
My husband was disrespected
by a woman unfit
to eat the crap between your toes.

36
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:33,350
Somebody ought to cut her open and
strangle her with her own entrails.

37
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:35,800
I love you, too.

38
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,910
If you want me, I'll be
under my bed. It wasn't that bad.

39
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:43,310
It was terrible. I hate soccer.

40
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:46,230
I stink. My team stinks.

41
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:50,670
27-0 doesn't reflect how close the
first five minutes of the game were.

42
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:53,230
Hey, you guys
won the coin toss.

43
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:57,670
I wanna quit. People don't just quit
cos they lose a couple of games.

44
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:00,710
The coach quit. He had
an emotional breakdown,

45
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:04,470
that's not the same thing.
The point is you're not quitting.

46
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:08,390
In fact, you know what?
I'm gonna coach you.

47
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:11,230
What?!
This will be great.

48
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:15,270
It'll give us a chance to hang out
together, kick the ball around.

49
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:18,470
Some day you might
look back and say,

50
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:22,150
"Boy, I sure had some fun
with my old man."

51
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:25,830
What do you say?
No! You're not quitting.

52
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:29,150
I am going to coach you
and we are going to create

53
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:32,400
treasured memories whether
you want to or not.

54
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,150
So, what's... on the...

55
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:40,030
..hard drive?
Nothing, he erased everything.

56
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:45,070
No, he deleted the programmes
but he didn't format the drive.

57
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:47,790
They never... do!

58
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:51,470
There it is. Let's check out
what he's got in here.

59
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:56,110
Let's go through his e-mails.
Why? It's Ed, what's he gonna...

60
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:58,510
Oh, my God!

61
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:03,910
"Eddie, last night was amazing.
You touched me places
my husband never knew existed."

62
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:08,990
T. Goodwin. That's Mrs Goodwin from
down the block. That's horrible!

63
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:11,710
They're both married... and fat!

64
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:16,590
Look at this one. "Edward, just
saying your name turns me to jelly."

65
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:18,910
That's... Mrs Fisher.

66
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:22,470
Mrs Carmen, Mrs
Wilson, Mrs Belt!

67
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:24,990
He's sleeping with
half the neighbourhood.

68
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:30,040
Here's one from old Mrs Swanback.
Open... the picture... attachment.

69
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:39,350
(BLOWS WHISTLE) Alright, kids,
let's huddle up. Hello, there.

70
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:42,230
My name is Hal.
I'm the new coach.

71
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:44,830
I don't know a
lot about soccer

72
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:50,110
but I do know about being a young
boy and growing up can be tough!

73
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:54,710
I know what it's like to be
the fat kid, the nose-picker -

74
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:57,150
just wipe it on
the grass, son.

75
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,630
But together we
are more than that.

76
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:02,790
Today we're gonna be a team!

77
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:07,070
Can we just forfeit and get a burger
before the line gets too long? No.

78
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:10,110
We're going out on
that field to have fun.

79
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:12,830
You kids make me sick!

80
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:16,870
If you're not puking from exhaustion,
you're not playing hard enough!

81
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:20,510
It's a beautiful day. Let's
go out and enjoy the sunshine

82
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:24,190
and play some soccer!
You will rip their heads off!

83
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:29,230
Do you hear me? Stop crying.
Stop crying, you little baby!

84
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:33,110
Hey, why don't you just
ease up? They're just kids.

85
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:37,440
Hear that, men? That's
what a loser sounds like.

86
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:43,790
What do you say we go out and give
it our best and have some fun?

87
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:47,710
(CHILDREN SOB / MOAN)
It was 48-0 before the half,

88
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:50,430
I had to call it.
Of course.

89
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:54,030
(ALL) Two, four, six, eight,
who did we annihilate?

90
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:58,550
The Tigers, The Tigers,
we had The Tigers.

91
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,650
Yeah!

92
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,550
Hey, Stevie.

93
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:07,910
You were supposed...
to meet me... at the library.

94
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:12,270
Oh, yeah, sorry. I actually found
something decent on Ed's computer.

95
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:16,110
The Virts? You
create a virtual family,

96
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:20,430
put them in different situations and
the computer plays out their lives.

97
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:24,030
Is that... your mom?

98
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:26,560
Not yet.

99
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,600
Reese.

100
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,710
Make sure... you capture...

101
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:39,110
..the blackness... of his soul.

102
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:41,190
Aggressiveness - ten.

103
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:44,000
Hygiene - zero. OK, now me.

104
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:49,590
Appearance - nine... No, ten.

105
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:53,990
A ten for intelligence.
And social skills,... ten.

106
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:57,910
Too bad... it
doesn't go... higher(!)

107
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:01,110
I have social
skills, jackass!

108
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:03,480
OK, it's dinner time.

109
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:13,520
Where's Malcolm? Looking at...
himself... in the mirror.

110
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,470
How you doing?
I'm hot and I'm bored.

111
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:23,270
What is this stuff? It smells awful.

112
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:27,350
What are you doing? There's bare
patches all over the place.

113
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:30,470
Are you paying attention
to what you're doing?

114
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:33,790
I get grounded plenty, Ed,
I know grunt work.

115
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:37,830
Why don't you go fix Mrs Collins's
garage door and get off my back?!

116
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:41,830
What did you say? You heard me.
Oh, my God, what do you know?

117
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:46,150
Formulate your megabytes next time
you get rid of your computer.

118
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:49,750
Oh, and by the way,...
Mrs Swanback?! You are sick!

119
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:54,110
Keep your voice down.
Look, it's not my fault.

120
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:56,110
I try to be faithful

121
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:59,590
but the women on this block
are just so desperate and lonely.

122
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:02,510
It's like I cast
some kind of spell.

123
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:06,790
I try to tell 'em no, but it
always leads to a back rub.

124
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:11,870
I know, Ed, I read all
about it. Is that you, Ed?

125
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:15,440
Ah, I'm a little
busy right now, Martha.

126
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:22,550
Look, you can't tell my wife.
You can't tell anyone, please.

127
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:25,960
I'll do anything.
I'll do anything you ask.

128
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,030
I can work with that.

129
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:33,510
Damn, don't they know someone's got
to clean up their caribou carcases?

130
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:36,470
These antlers won't fit
down the disposal.

131
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:40,030
Francis, come away from there.
You don't have to do that.

132
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:42,830
You're much too valuable
to mess with that.

133
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:47,310
Yesterday you said you'd seen
tumours with hair smarter than me.

134
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:51,990
Can't you tell good-natured ribbing?
I've got an important job for you.

135
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:56,710
Sit there and check the reception on
the TV - it's been spotty lately.

136
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:59,920
Oh, and make sure these sodas
haven't gone flat.

137
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,670
That sounds do-able. We've got
other people to do the grunt work.

138
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:09,750
A newlywed shouldn't be tiring
himself out before he even gets home.

139
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:13,880
Your lovely, young wife
wouldn't like that, would she?

140
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,030
What did you do?! I don't know
what you're talking about, honey.

141
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:23,910
Lavernia is treating me
like a human being.

142
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:27,550
What did you do to her?
Maybe she turned over a new leaf.

143
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:31,550
Sometimes really big crappy jerks
just realise they've got to change.

144
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:34,710
She was terrified.
I don't know how you did it

145
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:39,310
but you must have said something.
I wouldn't do that, Francis.

146
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:42,110
I'm not gonna fight
your battles for you.

147
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:45,990
Obviously that's not true.
Now, damn it, tell me what you did.

148
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:50,790
You know what, I don't have to
do anything you tell me to do,

149
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:55,950
and you might want to
reconsider your tone of voice.

150
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:59,470

make me so mad!

Alright, look,
today's practise was...

153
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:09,910
Well, let's focus on the positive.

154
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:14,230
I think it's encouraging that so
many of you found the right field.

155
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:18,230
Special congratulations go
to Billy for using the sidestep

156
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:23,390
to run away from the butterfly
that almost landed near him.

157
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:25,710
But we do need to work on

158
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:29,430
your general unwillingness
to kick the ball.

159
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:32,830
It hurts! Boys, if we
are going to get better,

160
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:35,070
we have to work together.

161
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:37,830
We have to start
acting like a team.

162
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:42,160
You know what it means
to be on a team, don't you?

163
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:47,310
Well, don't...
C'mon! Think of a team.

164

Yes! Yes, like the X-Men.

You boys are like the X-Men.

166
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:59,830
And what do the
X-Men do? Fight evil?

167
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:03,550
Yes, they work
together to fight evil

168
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:06,150
and also to uphold the ideals

169
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:09,670
of good sportsmanship and team work!

170

Boys, c'mon, huddle up, huddle up.
I should not be telling you this

173
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:24,950
but the American Youth Soccer
Federation has been infiltrated

174
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:28,710
by evil forces hellbent
on domination of the Earth.

175
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:32,510
The infiltration goes all the way
down to the lowest levels -

I'm talking The Black Hawks,
The Bulldogs, The Eagles.

177

Every other team in our league
has been lost to the forces of evil

178
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:44,270
and it's up to you boys
to stop them.

179

Now, boys, what do you say?

180
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:49,350
Who wants to be on
the side of goodness

181
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:52,830
and who wants
to rid the world of EVIL?

It's important to
protect your teeth

from the build-up
of invisible plaque.

188
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:52,200
But how do you fight
something that's invisible?

189
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,740
Simple.

190

00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:03,110
..start working?
Just one more second.

193
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:07,110
This is interesting. I made my mom
quit her job and go to Law School.

194
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:10,150
It's less money but
her happiness went way up.

195
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:14,680
I made Dad quit too. He's working on
neighbours' cars. Check out this.

Nothing, he's fine.
He's burning...

a parakeet and hold it hostage...

what's upsetting is, you
made this unilateral decision -

I said I'm sorry! How many times
do you want me to say it?

You didn't! You were
going to break up with me!

You think that
makes me feel safe?

clean it up without me. Or what?

00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:30,550
So, we head back to your place,
set up your Jacuzzi

276

then throw something
on the barbecue for me.

277

I've got a better idea. I'll get
in my Jacuzzi and you fix my dinner.

What? With the
information I just got,

279
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:44,710
I can call your mother and you
won't see daylight for years.

280
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:49,110
Oh, yeah? One word and I'm telling
your wife your little secret.

281
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:52,470
The question is -
am I more scared of my wife

282
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:55,560
or are you more scared
of your mother?

283
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:01,510
Then get a dozen peach roses
- they've got to be peach -

284
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:04,520

She's sorry, too, and
we just want you to have...

on this on the way over.

00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:27,230

to know that I...

00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:59,670
We're playing the Black Hawks again?!
You're forgetting your mission.

299
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:04,030
You're here to fight evil
and they are the most evil of all.

300
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:07,110
When the teacher
remembers to give you homework

301
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:10,270
right before you leave school,
the Black Hawks are behind it.

302
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:13,270
When your mother says,
"You can't watch TV,"

303
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:16,310
the Black Hawks
told her to say that.

304
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:20,350
All those Christmas presents you
wanted. Do you know who got them?

305
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:24,390
The Black Hawks. If it were up
to them, we wouldn't have Christmas!

306
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:26,990
(ALL GASP)
I, for one, am glad

307
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:31,150
we have the chance to fight
for what is right and good!

308
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:35,590
Now, I ask you boys, who are we
going to beat?! The Black Hawks!

309
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:38,870
And what are they?
Evil! Yeah!

310
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:41,880
Teams, take the field.
I love you, boys.

311
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,520
I've done all the coaching
I can do. The rest is up to them.

313
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:56,760
(ALL) Aaghhh!

314
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:08,550
Eat chalk, evil-doer!

315
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:12,960
Oh, my God! No, we couldn't
stop them if we wanted to.

316
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,790
You just left the truck
and ran all the way home?

317
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:25,760
You didn't see the look on her face.
I'm scared going to work tomorrow.

318
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,520
You know, she
does have a turtle.
