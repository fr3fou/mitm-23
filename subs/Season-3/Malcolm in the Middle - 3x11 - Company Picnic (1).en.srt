My dad's company picnic is
tomorrow. Laurie will be there.

28
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:32,360
I've had a crush on her
since third grade. (GRUNTS)

00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,310
I haven't seen her since
she moved last year.

I've grown four inches,
but I can't count on that.

00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:44,960
If I do 10,000 of these, I should
have something to show by tomorrow.

32
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,430
No candy tomorrow,
understand? I'll be fine!

33
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:53,310
You won't. What happened
at the last company picnic?

34
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:56,790
I got into a fight
with that red-headed boy.

35
00:03:56,890 --> 00:04:00,830
Why did you do that?
Because I ate candy.

36
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:05,390
Because you ate candy.
You do not metabolise sugar well.

37
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:09,550
You get mean, crazy, get
into fights and end up crying.

38
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:13,510
Do you want that to happen again
this year? No. Get ready for bed.

39
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:16,870
OK. What do you think?

40
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:20,750
This or this?
What are you doing?!

41
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:24,590
This is an important function.
It's a company picnic.

42
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:27,790
Attended by my new boss
whom I haven't met yet.

43
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:32,110
Gotta start off on the right foot.
You're making too much of this.

44
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:36,550
No, I am not! You have to make
a good first impression.

45
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:39,270
It sets the tone
for the relationship.

46
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:42,790
Al, this is your new
supervisor, Miss Plum.

47
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:45,430
I look forward to
working with you.

48
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:47,950
Same here.

49
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:50,430
Oh, and what do we have here?

50
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:54,840
My... big, fat sto-mach.

51
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,350
I'd like you to meet your staff,
but I'm not sure where they are.

53

It is great to meet you,
Mr Jacobson.

54
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:14,710
I want you to know I'm
gonna do a terrific job for you.

55
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:18,190
Great. Have you met my
daughter and son-in-law?

56
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:22,560
No, I haven't. Kelly? Steve?
I want you to meet somebody.

57
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:28,080
Hi. I'm Hal.
Hi. So nice to...

58
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:34,190
Oh, my God! There's
a toothpick in my eye!

59
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:38,040
She's gushing blood!
Put a tourniquet on her neck!

60
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,990
I'm outside of my body.
I can see a light.

61
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:46,190
Grandma? Is that you?
I'll chew off your face,

62
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:49,670
spit it out and dance on it!
I'm gonna kill you!

63
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:52,270
I'm gonna drag your carcass
through the street.

64
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:55,150
She's got a toothpick in her eye!

65
00:05:55,250 --> 00:06:00,070
It's like a chess game.
Every subtle move is vital.

(STRAINS) Eight.

67
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,910
God, what did you
do? You're huge! Shut up.

68
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:14,470
Be careful. You might frighten
Laurie with your savage manliness.

69
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:18,310
Who says I'm doing it for Laurie?
So Laurie's fair game?

70
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:22,510
I wonder if she likes older men.
Don't. I really like this girl.

71
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:26,470
Please! It's my first chance
to see her since she moved away.

72
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:30,430
I'm asking you as a brother. Please
don't be a jerk and screw this up.

73
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:35,320
Wow, this desperate grovelling
is new for you. Keep it up.

74
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,110
Call yourselves a hockey team?

75
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:45,910
To beat McCallister Oil you'll
have to play better than that.

76
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:48,910
You're making stupid mistakes,
missing opportunities.

77
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:52,760
Keep your mind on the game!
Are our pay cheques here yet?

78
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:59,350
Aren't you done with that sink yet?
There's more than when I started.

79
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:03,670
You don't leave until it's finished.
It'd be faster if Eric helped.

80
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:06,910
I'm not letting my star player
near that toxic filth.

81
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:10,510
I slave away by myself
just because he plays hockey?

82
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:14,710
He doesn't just play hockey.
He skates like the wind.

83
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:19,270
He's got a 70mph slapshot.
Well, indoors, fresh ice.

84
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:23,430
We'll teach those thugs
a lesson they won't forget.

85
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:27,030
Those chicks won't know
what hit 'em. You're playing girls?

86
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:31,590
The men won't play us
till we beat the ladies' team.

87
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:35,470
Those girls play dirty, make
fun of us, and steal our women.

88
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:39,750
Wow! People who are more humiliated
than me. I'd love to see that.

89
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:43,310
Wish granted. You're our
equipment manager. What?!

90
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:47,320
Rinaldo came down with
jock lung. Here's your cheque.

91
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,390
Eric, there's a little extra
for you. Thanks.

92
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:55,270
There's no money in this cheque.
It says I owe you $14.

93
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:59,310
I didn't buy anything last week.
Cost-of-living increases.

94
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:04,190
Your room, board, pillow rental
and the rubber gloves, princess(!)

95
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:06,190
This is insane!

96
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:09,990
I won't work 60 hours a week
and still owe you money. I quit!

97
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:14,270
Fine. Give me the $604
you racked up and you can go.

98
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:19,310
What? How can I have possibly $604
when you keep taking my money?

99
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:21,990
Shut up! And get back to work.

100
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:27,200
Don't let your equipment-manager
duties get in the way of your real
work.

101
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,960
Man, that sucks.

102
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,590

103
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:40,710
Hello? It's Francis.
I'm in a real bind.

104
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:43,150
I don't have any money.
"Hear me out."

105
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:47,070
Tell Mom they're sending
the smart kids to Washington, DC,

106
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:51,320
get $600 and spend a weekend
at Stevie's. Reese, phone.

107
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:58,910
Hello? Reese. You know the hardware
store? The entry way is slippery...

108
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:01,590
Dewey, phone.

109
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:04,640
Francis? Yeah.
Money? Yeah.

110
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:22,550
I don't know why I go
to these things. I am so nervous.

111
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:26,510
My stomach sounds like
a bunch of dogs fighting.

112
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:30,440
Get your ear down there.
Hal, you'll be fine.

113
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,230
What are you doing?
Just keep moving.

114
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:40,270
Is your new boss even here?
They're all here.

115
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:43,150
There's Landon. He's the head
of the whole company.

116
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:46,590
Of course the new guy's here.
Don't talk nonsense!

117
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:50,190
You've never met him. Do you know
who you're hiding from?

118
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:52,470
That's a good point.

119
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:56,110
Is the new boss here yet?
Yeah. He's right over there.

120
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:59,430
Let me know when
you'll introduce yourself.

121
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:04,510
We figure you'll set him on fire.
Don't give him ideas. Bet's off.

122
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:08,710
I'm nervous enough as it is.
We're just teasing you.

123
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:12,630
You'll do fine. You and
I both know that's a lie.

124
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:15,040
Yeah, well, I tried.

125
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,670
Hi, Mom. Splendid
day for a picnic.

126
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:33,190
You want to do this the
easy way or the hard way?

127
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:36,440
The hard way.
Spread 'em.

128
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:48,550
I won't always be around to do this.
You have to control yourself.

129
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:50,960
I know.

130
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,280
Undies.

131
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:07,040
Malcolm? Laurie, hi.
It is so good to see you.

132
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,230
Yeah. Good to see you too.

133
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:16,430
I can't believe how tall you are.
Yeah, well, you know...

134
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:19,750
I've missed you guys so much.
I've missed you too.

135
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:23,910
I mean, we've all missed you.
Everyone. Not just me.

136
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:26,510
Are you doing the
three-legged hunt? What?

137
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:30,310
They tie your leg to another
person's and send you to find stuff.

138
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:33,830
You can win $100.
I just need a partner.

139
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:38,710
Do you want to do it?
Really? Yeah, it sounds great.

140
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:42,510
Cool. Is that
your brother?

141
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:46,680
Hi, Reese.
Sorry. I'm gay. OK.

142
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,160
(You owe me!)

143
00:11:52,680 --> 00:15:23,030
.

144
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:26,920
The diamond standard of dishwashing
won't come from a dirty dishwasher.

145
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:30,280
Finish Dishwasher Cleaner is far
better at removing hidden grease

146
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,580
and limescale.

147
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,680
And a cleaner dishwasher
means cleaner dishes.

148
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,100
It's only dishwashing,

149
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:39,360
but you deserve perfect
results every time.

150
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,880
.

00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:17,510
Do you work for the company or are
you a drag-along? A drag-along.

152
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:20,110
Me too. My husband drags me along

153
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:22,990
then runs off
and talks to his friends.

154
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:26,710
I hide. Hide?
From my kids.

155
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:31,670
It's great to have somebody to talk
to. I'm bad at social situations.

156
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:35,710
My psychiatrist says
I'm emotionally detached

157
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:40,350
and that I have paranoid fantasies
about what people think about me.

158
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:42,310
(GIGGLES)

159
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:44,310
Uh-huh?

160
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:49,390
It can get really ugly.
False accusations, crying attacks.

161
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:53,710
I don't know why my husband married
me. I know why I married him.

162
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:57,350
I'm addicted to
disapproval. Ah. Really?

163
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:01,670
Yeah. Of course,
I only have myself to blame.

164
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:07,190
He's exactly like my father was.
Oh, my God! He was so judgemental.

165
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:10,280
Every time I spoke,
I felt I was torturing him.

166
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:34,190
Wow, they're good.
They got nothing on my boy.

167
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:37,430
How's the diarrhoea?
You feeling alright? Tiptop.

168
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:42,270
There's Lavernia. I hear she might
actually have a team this year.

169
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:45,910
Think we ought to adjust
the front line? Clarence?

170
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:49,070
Clarence! What?

171
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:53,270
Hey, Lavernia! I was afraid
you'd show your face.

172
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:58,630
Not that I was afraid you'd play me,
just that you'd show your face.

173
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:03,350
Hello, Clarence. I thought
you only gave pep talks in your van.

174
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:05,430
You'll get a boyfriend one day.

175
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:08,790
You'll have a
moment of bliss,

176
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:13,270
then you'll bite his head off and lay
your eggs in his decapitated body.

177
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:17,550
Was that comment necessary?
That's why people don't like you.

178
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:21,550
People like me.
Who doesn't like me?

179
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:25,910
I got a good feeling about today.
These girls aren't so tough.

180
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:29,200
Wait till I get out there.
I'm gonna... (SCREAMS)

181
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,310
How's my breath? It seems fine.

182
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:48,630
Not too minty?
That can be just as bad.

183
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:51,240
Please give me
back my compact.

184
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:59,990
OK, get in, get out,
just say hello and go.

185
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:02,310
No. (GASPS)

186
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:07,070
Mr Landon. Hello. I told you about
the first time I met this guy?

187
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:11,350
The urinal-cake guy?
(LAUGHS) Unbelievable.

188
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:15,630
But I didn't fire him. He's one
of our finest systems managers.

189
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:20,710
It goes to show that even
a gibbering idiot can surprise you.

190
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:23,710
That would make a great chapter
heading for your new book.

191
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:28,310
I thought he dropped his pill case.
Excuse me for being considerate!

192
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:32,670
Hi! John Pratt. It is
a pleasure to meet you.

193
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:36,710
Hi. You are a hard man to find.
I had to have someone point you out.

194
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:39,470
Well, it's not like
I'm avoiding you.

195
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:42,230
(BOTH LAUGH)

196
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:45,670
I heard you had
a great sense of humour.

197
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:48,190
I know it's gonna be great
working with you.

198
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:51,390
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

199
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:55,110
I should get back
to my family now.

200
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:57,430
Right. Sorry to hold you up.

201
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:02,480
It is a real pleasure to
meet you, Mr Landon. Same here.

202
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:14,030
Boys, you got ten minutes. Leave
your wallets and valuables in here.

203
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:17,430
You gotta get out
on the ice and warm up.

204
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:21,510
I don't think I can play. My glute
cramped up on the ride over.

205
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:25,510
You have to play.
Go lay down on that table.

206
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:30,150
You! Get over there.
Give him a good, strong massage.

207
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:34,200
Work that knot out of
his glute. Out of his what?

208
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,550
No way! He's our
goalie. We need him.

209
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:42,670
No! Look, you owe me $604.

210
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:45,830
You do this, I'll take off $1.50.

211
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:50,910
$1.50?! And if you don't, I'll
charge you $50 for the ride home.

212
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:54,870
The rest of you, get out there.
Show 'em what you got.

213
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:59,360
Here. You're responsible for these
valuables till after the game.

214
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:03,190
Don't be afraid
to dig in deep.

215
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:06,760
If it helps, I'll
unhitch the trap door.

216
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:15,950
Get up, you idiot! Are you stupid?

217
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:18,200
Ow!

218
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,640
I said, hustle for
the breaks! Hustle!

219
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:27,270
I was in the locker room
and the other coach approached me.

220
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:31,550
What's that reptilian sack
of dog logs trying to pull now?

221
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:35,390
He wants to make a wager with you
on the outcome of the game.

222
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:41,430
$642, to be exact. I don't bet.
I earn my money and hold on to it.

223
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:45,750
He said you'd be
afraid. Oh, he did?

224
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:50,670
He also said John Grisham
was a hack with no sense of plot

225
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:53,750
and a tin ear for dialogue.
He said that about Mr Grisham?

226
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:58,990
Alright, he wants to bet? We'll bet.
Tell him to make it 700.

227
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:03,510
He was pretty adamant
about the $642. Fine.

228
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:08,400
Hey, Chuck! I need you
to hold on to some bet money.

229
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:14,560
That idiot Clarence has no idea
what we got in store for him.

230
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:23,400
Easiest 700 I
ever made. (WHISTLE) >

231
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:27,550
What's with my skates?
The blades are so dull.

232
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:32,670
Somebody unscrewed mine.
I got Vaseline on my grip tape.

233
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:34,750
(KLAXON)

234
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:37,280
Go, go, go, go!

235
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,910
He is never home.

236
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:46,110
We last had dinner together
six months ago... with his boss!

237
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:48,470
Did I tell you about
our anniversary?

238
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:51,310
I bought $30's
worth of candles.

239
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:54,070
I wore a negligee
the size of a postage stamp.

240
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:57,870
He walks in an hour late and spends
six hours in a computer chat room.

241
00:22:57,970 --> 00:23:02,350
I drank an entire bottle
of champagne then I passed out.

242
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:05,230
I woke up with the dog
licking my face.

243
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:08,790
And I actually thought
it was my husband!

244
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:10,750
I'm gonna find my boys.

245
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:13,830
As if he would show me
any kind of affection.

246
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:18,990
To him, I'm the fat lady that
answers his psychiatrist's phone.

247
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:22,710
In my mind, I do see myself
as a 200-pounder.

248
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:25,510
But I have seen the way
other men look at me.

249
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:30,430
Wanda! So good to see you again.
Wanda, Meg. Wanda, Meg.

250
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:33,600
Why don't you get to know
each other? I'll be right back.

251
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:38,160
So, how do you know Lois?

252
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,360
Que?

253
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,830
I like you. You're fun.
I like you too.

254
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:50,070
Want some of my candy?

255
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:52,560
(YELLS)

256
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:02,390
Fill up on that bread. It's better
you get sick on that than on candy.

257
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:06,480
I got enough to worry about
without you going crazy on me.

258
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:12,480
Stay here!

259
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,870
Hi, Lois. Are you hiding back here?
No, just enjoying the shade.

260
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:29,110
Did you meet your new boss? Yep.
How did it go? Fine. We hit it off.

261
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:33,310
What happened? What do you mean?
It went well. He likes me.

262
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:38,270
Is it so hard to imagine I made a
good first impression? Mr Landon?

263
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:41,310
You should give me a
little credit. Hey, boss!

264
00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:44,230
Is he calling you...?
Of course he isn't!

265
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:47,150
Whatever you were
going to say, he isn't.

266
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:49,800
I'm not going
anywhere until... Lois!

267
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:57,360
Mr Landon!

268
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:02,750
Did I tell you that his mother
is coming to visit me this week?

269
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:06,310
She despises me, but
at least she talks to me.

270
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:11,030
My husband hasn't said two words
besides, "Where's the remote?"

271
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:13,590
and "How far are
those gonna sag?"

272
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:15,870
This isn't a good time.

273
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:19,550
Every year, he has to go
to this stupid get-together

274
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:23,310
for his friends from college.
We're about to go to this party

275
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:26,030
and he tells me
not to say anything stupid.

276
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:28,390
I embarrass him one time!

277
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:31,040
I didn't know
who Ernest Hemingway was.

278
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:37,800
Alright, girls? OK,
Pete and Cathy, you're next.

279
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:43,430
It is so great to see you again.
Great to see you too.

280
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:47,190
For those of you without partners,
we've done a random pairing.

281
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:50,310
Mike and Christina.
Reese and George.

282
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:53,630
I'm Reese. I'm George.

283
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:58,030
You can call me George.
I can eat eight hot dogs.

284
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:01,030
That's good, George(!)

285
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:04,030
You've got to
be kidding me!

286
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:08,750
It's weird being away from
the friends I grew up with. I bet.

287
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:12,870
Malcolm, can I ask
you something? Sure.

288
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:17,830
If you liked somebody, and you had
no idea if they liked you back,

289
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:21,550
would you say something?

290
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:25,870
I've always thought honesty
was a good thing. Me too.

291
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:30,110
But what if they lived too far away
and it'd be really hard?

292
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:34,030
I like you too, Laurie.
I really like you.

293
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:36,310
Honestly, you
have no idea.

294
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:39,110
I've liked you for years.
I think about you all the time.

295
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:42,030
Oh, no! What?

296
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:45,190
Oh, my God! I am so sorry!

297
00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:48,430
I was talking
