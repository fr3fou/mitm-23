Oh, I am SO sorry...!

158
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:48,350
I should've kissed your boo-boos
and made dem better.

159
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:51,790
I was supposed to tell
the bad little boy stories

160
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:56,030
and bake you giant sugar cookies
and knit you fluffy sweaters,

161
00:14:56,130 --> 00:15:01,350
carried you and held you, and told
you how much I loved your diapers.

162
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:07,270
Why don't you just unhinge your jaw
and finish me off? After Magnum PI.

163
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:10,360
Lois! I'm home!

164
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:19,550
Honey, look, I saw something
and I just HAD to get it for you.

165
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:22,590
It's a little more than we agreed
to spend on each other

166
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:25,870
but - hey, it's Christmas! -
we got a whole year to follow rules!

167
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:28,430
It's beautiful..!

168
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:30,990
I mean, isn't that what
the season is all about?

169
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:34,390
Relaxing, enjoying things,
making people happy.

170
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:36,710
Hal, that's so
sweet and thoughtful.

171
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:39,680
I hope I get to open it.

172
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,960
Rats!

173
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,710
You're doin' it all wrong.

174
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:51,470
You've seven ornaments, I'm putting
them on your tree - what's wrong?

175
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:55,600
Go get the angel off
the - hic! - mantel.

176
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,430
Who's this?

177
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:05,120
That is your grandfather
when he was - hic! - young man.

178
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:10,310
Euch! Tell me that eyebrow
isn't genetic(!)

179
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:12,990
You and him. Both the same.

180
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:15,710
Always had to
have your own way.

181
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:19,990
Nothing ever good enough.
Always had to fight everything.

182
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:23,390
Victor always had to be
SO independent.

183
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:27,630
Left home when he was 11,
lived on his own,

184
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:31,630
go to work on farm,
ploughin' the fields.

185
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:34,750
Like a man. Worked 18 hours a day.

186
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:37,310
Had to sleep with the pigs.

187
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:40,310
But he never complained.

188
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:42,710
He was strong.

189
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:45,680
He made something of himself.

190
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,870
Nobody like that anymore.

191
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:52,160
Everybody's too soft.

192
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:57,150
Hey, Grandma, why don't
you let me help you with that?

193
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:59,590
Your grandfather was tough!

194
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:03,960
He didn't take anything
from anybody.

195
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,670
He was... proud.

196
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:11,150
A man of... honour.

197
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:14,640
He was a wonderful,...

198
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,800
..wonderful man.

199
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,680
(MUMBLES IN RUSSIAN)

200
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,920
(MUMBLES IN RUSSIAN)

201
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,200
Grandma?

202
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:37,160
Grandma? Oh!

203
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:42,240
Oh, God!

204
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,830
Just one more night.
We can get through one night!

205
00:17:55,930 --> 00:18:00,230
We should be proud. Everything's
put away.
And not a single fight.

206
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:03,230
We did it! We're
going to get presents?

207
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:06,430
We're gonna get presents.
What do we do now?

208
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:09,350
We could take a nap?
Or play quietly.

209
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:12,550
VERY quietly.

210
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:15,150
(SQUEAKS)
(GASPS)

211
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:18,440
SHUT UP! SHUT UP!

212
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,950
Oh, God... I will be so glad
when Christmas is over!

213
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:28,990
Then we'll be safe for another year.
Mom's doing this NEXT Christmas?!

214
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:32,350
Why not? It worked, didn't it?
And maybe not just Christmas!

215
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:37,990
What? She could do it for Halloween
or Fourth of July or birthdays?!

216
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:42,510
She can't do this! I can't
take any more!
We have to stop her!

217
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:44,230
Something drastic.
I'm in.

218
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:47,390
Mom needs to know she
can't take occasions hostage.

219
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:50,030
That we DON'T negotiate!

220
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:53,990
She turned a BEAUTIFUL
family holiday into a nightmare.

221
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:57,880
We'll show her the
TRUE spirit of Christmas.

222
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:15,910
First, you mustn't think
of this as Christmas cider.

223
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:19,230
It's a non-denominational
winter cider.

224
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:22,350
The boys are doing
so well... (GROANS)

225
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:25,470
Lois?
I'm a terrible mother!

226
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:28,830
I shouldn't be
allowed to have children.

227
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:31,590
Sweetie...
I've ruined Christmas!

228
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:35,590
Whaddaya mean? The boys are behaving
like I never knew they could!

229
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:39,030
I thought that's what you
wanted. But not like this!

230
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:43,310
I wanted to take it back five
minutes after I took the presents

231
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:45,790
but I didn't know how!

232
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:49,390
I'M A MONSTER! No,
you're not a monster...!

233
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:51,590
I am. I really am.

234
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:55,430
No, you're not a monster.
WHY WON'T YOU ADMIT I'M A MONSTER?!

235
00:19:55,530 --> 00:20:00,950
Alright, in this particular case,
you're a monster. I know...!

236
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:03,590
(WAILS)
(PHONE RINGS)

237
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:06,270
Let the machine get it.

238
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:09,270
Come on...! You know
when you cry it makes me cry.

239
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:12,190
You are a WONDERFUL mother.

240
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:14,750
And you're a wonderful person.

241
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:19,350
(BEEP)
"Hey, Mom. Francis. I am DISGUSTED
with how you treat Grandma!"

242
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:23,590
"Abandoning a helpless old woman at
Christmas? I hope you're ASHAMED!"

243
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:26,390
I am... I am.

244
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:29,310
Hal, the boys
don't deserve this.

245
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:33,510
They're a little high-spirited,
but they're GOOD, GOOD boys!

246
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:36,230
God, this feels so right!

247
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:39,270
This is WAY better
than real Christmas!

248
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:43,760
Remember, mess 'em up just enough
so Mom can't return them.

249
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:49,390
Wait a minute... Mom got me
the exact video game I asked for.

250
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:53,390
These are better
than what I asked for.

251
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:56,510
You know what?

252
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:59,630
Mom got me everything I wanted.

253
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:01,670
Me, too.

254
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:06,790
She listened to us. OK,
so she got lucky a few times.

255
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:09,630
I never asked
for a stupid globe!

256
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:11,630
That's mine.

257
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:13,880
The cleats are yours. Oh.

258
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:20,190
Mom really tried this year.
All she wanted was a nice Christmas.

259
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:22,510
And we ruined it.

260
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:25,230
In all fairness,
we ruin everything.

261
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:30,390
Remember, how happy we were
a minute ago. Can we go back?

262
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:32,510
I dunno.

263
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:35,960
Do we have any
paint left? No.

264
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,560
Oh, well...

265
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,550
What are you doing?

266
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:50,360
Doin' you a favour, so
why not shut up and enjoy it.

267
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:01,310
What is this? Oh, you don't wanna
look in there, it's too sad.

268
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:04,350
Grandma, what are
all these things?

269
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:07,550
There must be a
thousand dollars

270
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:10,670
worth of stuff
in here. $2,735.

271
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:13,270
$4500 Canadian.

272
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:16,310
Why are they in your
closet? They're gifts.

273
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:19,790
For the family, for
relatives, for friends...

274
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:24,950
But you never give... Oh, my God!
Donatello with pizza-throwing
action?!

275
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:29,070
I wanted one of these when I was
six! I know. I bought it for you.

276
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:31,470
No, you didn't.
Yes, I did.

277
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:36,190
And then, right before Christmas,
your mommy put you on the phone

278
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:39,550
you call me "Poopy" and hung up.

279
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:41,790
Is that the breadmaker
Mom wanted last year?

280
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:47,590
If she wants bread so much
she should write back when
her mother writes to her.

281
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:50,230
This was for cousin Nicola.

282
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:52,950
I spent a day
shopping for it.

283
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:55,590
Then she marries a Protestant.

284
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:58,030
That camera? For your father.

285
00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:01,240
Then he refused to drive me
to the liquor store.

286
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:05,320
All the nice things I do for people.

287
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,790
Oh, my god, you're crazy!

288
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:12,910
I just thought you were evil,
but you are nuts!

289
00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:16,550
What are you talking about?
Grandma, gifts aren't conditional.

290
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:19,390
You give them to people
because you love them!

291
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:22,470
They're not something you can take
away because of some petty slight!

292
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:27,390
You're not teaching people anything
They don't KNOW they've upset you!

293
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:32,030
You've just constructed
a monument to your insanity!

294
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:34,190
WHAT SORT OF PERSON DOES THAT?

295
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:36,710
A lonely,...

296
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:40,430
..bitter,... old woman.

297
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:44,150
What?
Look what I've done.

298
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:47,640
What use is all
this to me now?

299
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:53,390
They could have brought someone some
happiness. Instead they rot here.

300
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:55,830
Oh... Grandma?

301
00:23:55,930 --> 00:23:58,710
My hea... heart.

302
00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:03,720
I think it's... melting.

303
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,910
Yes...

304
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:10,230
It's melting. Oh...

305
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:14,870
You showed me the way,
Francis, by yelling at me.

306
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:20,070
Go get my magic sled and me and my
reindeers will go and give Christmas

307
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:23,230
to all the mean, stupid,
rude people!

308
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:25,870
We'll all join
hands and sing songs

309
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:29,710
and we'll sprinkle the
ingrates with fairy dust!

310

Are you sure you
wanna do this? Yes!

00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:35,150
I mean, taking
presents away from children?!

312
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:37,670
What sort of sick
person does that?!

313
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:41,470
Let's get everything out of
the garage and set it up inside

314
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:44,070
and have a nice Christmas!
You know what?

315
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:46,510
Let's wake up the boys
and have Christmas tonight!

Imagine their
little faces...!

317
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,710
Well, Hal,... that was...

318
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:09,440
..smart of you...
to wake up the boys...

319
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:14,440
..so they could help us
carry in the presents.

320
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,790
Yes, yes...

321
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:20,870
C-come on... hurry up, boys.

322
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:23,920
Yeah... Sure...
OK...

I hope you like 'em, sweetie!

I think we have another present here
for Reese! I wonder what it is?!

332
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:14,110
This really is the best
Christmas we've ever had!
