The usual. We're on punishment.

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,680
We had the eggs, we had
the golf clubs, what d'you expect?

Whoa! Really?

12
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:50,790
I want that thing spotless! I want
to be able to lick the bricks.

13
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:54,670
When you gonna lick the bricks?
I want you to lick the bricks.

14
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:59,830
I'll lick the bricks right now.
This is your last day of punishment.
You want one day more?

Alright, alright!

Oh!

17
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,630
Stevie's dad got three extra tickets
to the Demolition Derby!

18
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:17,680
Cool! That's not the best part!
We get the handicapped seats
in the front!

Mom, can we go to the
Demolition Derby tomorrow?

Demolition Derby?
What? You wanna go tomorrow?

21
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:28,350
Yeah. Why not? Our
punishment's over tonight.

22
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:32,790
Think we may have something planned
for tomorrow? The Demolition Derby.

23
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:36,830
Or could it be that tomorrow is
your father's birthday?!

24
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:38,950
Oh. We talked about this!

25
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:43,070
Maybe Dad can come with us. Yeah, we
could get him a ticket as a present.

26
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:45,750
You're not going anywhere!
You're staying at home

27
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:49,350
and we're gonna throw your father
a party like we talked about!

28
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:52,150
I have something very special
planned. Like what?

29
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:55,830
It's none of your business. It's
a surprise. I can't believe you!

00:02:55,930 --> 00:03:00,190
You have to be forced into
celebrating your father's birthday?!

31

You should be
ashamed of yourselves!

32
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:06,800
You don't have to yell, we can hear
you just fine if you talk
in a normal tone of voice.

present system.

Get back to work.

35
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,910
I'm not OK with the present system!
How does she make me say things
like that?

Oh, my God! What is it?

37

Francis is coming home.
Really? You're kidding!

No, this is his itinerary.
He gets in tomorrow.

I hope this doesn't ruin Mom's plan.

This is Mom's plan!

41
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:38,150
Why didn't she tell us?
Because it's a surprise for Dad!

42
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,990
And if we blow her secret,
Mom is gonna kill us!

43
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:44,800
So we just need to keep our mouths
shut and finish our work. Right.

ran every morning

so your father and I can talk? No!

Excuse me? I'm not leaving!

you want without even asking us!

that's actually fun!

So you're left
with two choices!

00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:50,600
You can either fight somewhere else
or get us a TV for our room!

95

There's no reasoning with
that woman.

I thought you
made some good points.

97
00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:02,230
It doesn't matter, she doesn't
listen. It's like talking to a wall.

the ice cream to loosen up.

it soft. No, I don't.

104
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:35,230
Yes, you do. In
fact, so do we. We all do.

105
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:37,640
Since when? Since yesterday.

106
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:43,030
What happened yesterday? Dad, just
be patient. This isn't a witch hunt.

107
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:46,430
Just calm down, and
whatever happens is gonna happen.

108
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:48,710
What are you talking about?

109
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:52,480
What I'm trying to say is we're
gonna get through this together.

110
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,310
As a family.

111
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:58,350
And as individuals.

112
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:02,160
In this great

at you! Come here!

119
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:26,150
I can't believe it!
How long are you staying?

120
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:29,310
A few days. You surprised?
Surprised? I'm, I'm, I'm in shock!

121
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:31,910
You should be! I've been
planning this for months!

122

Thank you! Happy
birthday, honey.

another surprise for you.

We're married. Hi.

128
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,470
I was gonna tell you over
the phone and then I thought,

129
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:57,950
why not bring her down here
and surprise you!

130
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:02,510
You're married?
Piama and I are husband and wife.
We got married last week.

131
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:05,150
Last week?
Francis, who is this woman?

132
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:08,230
She's my wife.
Her name is Piama.

133
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:10,330
Hello.

134
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:17,070
Well, come on, isn't
anyone gonna congratulate us?

135
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:20,910
What? For getting married.
That's what families do.

136
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:25,270
I think I'm gonna be sick. Come on,
Mom, at least try and be happy!

137
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:29,990
This is a hell of a thing to dump
in my lap on your father's birthday!

138
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:31,790
Yeah, it's all
about you, Mom.

139
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:35,670
Excuse me for thinking my family
would be excited to meet my wife!

140
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:37,770
I can't believe you guys!

141
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,390
Come on, Francis, it's not
their fault. What d'you expect?

142
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:44,470
You could've called ahead of time.
Boys, go to your room!

143
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:46,550
What? We're on your side!

144
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:49,040
I said go!

145
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,230
How long have you known each other?
You never mentioned her.

146
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:58,470
I only met her a month
ago. Today. Happy anniversary.

147
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:00,230
Plus we had the
whole bus ride down.

148
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:02,950
A month? (LAUGHS) I misjudged you!

149
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:06,390
That's the longest you've ever stuck
with anything in your life!

150
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:09,750
Congratulations, you
outlasted his paper route!

151
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:13,750
Lady, you don't want to
stick your hand in my face.

152
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:17,350
Hey, everybody calm down. We are
calm! It's Mom's who's flipping out!

153
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,310
Oh, Francis, I haven't
even started to flip out!

154
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:23,110
Why can't you be happy?!
We're supposed to be happy?

155
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:25,990
You behave like this,
after all we've done for you?!

156
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:30,110
I'm confused! Are we talking about
the years of psychological abuse

157
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:32,670
or sending me to
military school?!

158
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:36,630
This family sucks. They don't care
about us, they don't listen to us!

159
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:39,670
Let's get outta here.
To the Demolition Derby?

160
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:43,590
No, let's really get outta here
and get away from these people.

161
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:47,150
Where are we gonna go?
Wherever this takes us.

162
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:50,670
I snagged it out of Dad's wallet
this morning. You knew we'd need it?

163
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:53,110
Er,... yeah.

164
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:56,910
I'm in. Yeah, but... ..into a pulp
and throw me in the trash!

165
00:10:57,010 --> 00:11:00,070
Why do I even try? You've been
nothing but a problem since...

166
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:04,510
Let's go. He's
trying to explain it to you,

167
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:06,310
if you'd listen
to him for once!

168
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:09,350
Why are you talking?
Why are you talking?!

169
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:11,350
Can we just stop this?!

170
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:14,710
Let's get in the car
and go for a drive to cool off.

171
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:16,710
We can still have a nice party.

172
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:20,070
Oh, we are long past
having a nice party!

173
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:25,350
As usual, Francis has taken
something that should've been sweet
and ruined it!

174
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:28,950
Don't pin this on me, I'm completely
willing to have a party right now!

175
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:32,430
Oh, you want to have a party?
Happy damn birthday!

176
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:34,880
Hey, why don't we
all have some cake?

177
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,790
We don't want to be a part of this
family any more, we're leaving!

178
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:44,470
Oh, great, here we
go with the dramatics!

179
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:47,150
Who else wants cake?!
Thank you. You're welcome.

180
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,790
Who wants some
delicious damn cake?

181
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:53,990
Can Piama have a rose? Why not?
There's plenty to go around!

182
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:57,790
I'm the one who broke
the ice maker last year!

183
00:11:57,890 --> 00:11:59,710
Why do you have
to ruin everything?!

184
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:01,810
Well, I learned
from the best, Mom!

185
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,760
.

186
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,660
You're two
clicks away

187
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,760
from the new shape
of lip colour.

188
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,520
Infallible colour
lasts up to 16 hours,

189
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,620
even after
eating.

190
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,960
The conditioning balm
helps lock in moisture.

191
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,020
Brilliant!

192
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,060
In ten radiant shades.

193
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,980
Colour that's made
to stay on your lips...

194
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,080
And only on your lips.

195
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,020
Infallible?

196
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,120
It's my lip colour.

197
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,340
The lip duo
compact

198
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,220
that lasts
up to 16 hours.

199
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,320
Because you're worth it.

200
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:57,910
.

201
00:16:58,010 --> 00:17:01,470
Wow! I've never been in
a hotel this fancy before.

202
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:03,830
This isn't a hotel, Dewey,
it's our new home.

203
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:05,930
OK, lemme do all the talking.

204
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:11,070
May I help you? My dad
called in a reservation.

205
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:13,510
OK.

206
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:17,480
There you are. As soon as your dad
signs this, you're all set.

207
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:21,630
Oh! He's out at the car,
but we can take care of it.

208
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:24,390
If you wanna have a seat,
we'll just wait for your dad.

209
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:28,110
Could we speed this along? My little
brother isn't feeling very well.

210
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:31,510
Yeah. My dad's gonna be a while.
He's cleaning up Dewey's sick.

211
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:35,230
I'm sorry, but an adult
needs to sign for the room.

212
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:38,830
Look, he's really sick.
He could blow any second.

213
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:40,930
He doesn't look
that sick to me.

214
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,200
(RETCHES)

215
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,430
Dewey, that was amazing!

216
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:53,600
I'm hungry. I bet you are.

217
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,200
How do you guys
want your steaks?

218
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,630
Shall we look in the park?

219
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:05,240
Nobody goes there
since they put the lights in.

220
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,240
Oh!

221
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:14,430
Why didn't you tell us you were
getting married?
It happened kinda fast.

222
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:17,470
How can you know anyone in a month?
Dad, I knew in a minute.

223
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:20,230
Trust me, Piama is the one.

224
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:24,720
She's a little fiery, but she's also
kind and funny and completely real.

225
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:28,590
You just haven't gotten to know her.
And who's fault is that?

226
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:32,270
I know, but that's why I brought
her, so you'd all get to know her!

227
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:35,310
It wasn't supposed to
turn into the Apocalypse!

228
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:38,910
And what about you and Mom?
You got married pretty quick.

229
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:42,840
Yes, but I was a few years older,
I'd already been with a lot of...

230
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,070
I had lived a full life.
So you were older.

231
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:50,310
I just ran into the right person for
me a little earlier than you did.

232
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:52,870
Once you meet
that person, why wait?

233
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:55,870
Huh? Why not do
it if I'm sure?

234
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:58,190
Should I not do it
cos my family's not sure?

235
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:01,790
It wouldn't matter if the wedding
was next week or 10 years from now,

236
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:04,030
you and Mom would've
had a problem with it.

237
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:07,040
All my life - I
would've come, Francis. What?

238
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:11,190
If you had invited me,
I would've come.

239
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:13,290
Really?

240
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,400
I'm sorry.

241
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,200
Didn't I tell you
flowers were a great idea?

242
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,030
OK, we're all set.

243
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:31,550
You have the Plaza burger,
the main lobster,

244
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:34,430
the porterhouse,
large French fries

245
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:37,600
and the complete dessert cart.

246
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:43,230
Your parents have an interesting
taste in food. Yeah, they do.

247
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:47,470
Actually, I'm gonna need
one of your parents to sign that.

248
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:51,880
I left the tip blank, why don't you
put in what you think is fair?

249
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,920
Bon appetit.

250
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,710
Dewey, your dinner's here!

251
00:19:57,810 --> 00:20:00,040
There you go, Reese.
Thank you, Malcolm.

252
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,230
So this is what a
$24 hamburger looks like.

253
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:06,670
I thought it'd be
as big as my head.

254
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:09,590
Ah! Why don't we have
a jacuzzi tub at home?

255
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:11,590
Because that would make us happy.

256
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:14,830
Forget about that place.
Tonight, this is our home.

257
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:18,150
You got a lobster? Yes.
I think I deserve a lobster.

258
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,270
We all deserve
something nice for once.

259
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:22,590
Whoa! This dinner was expensive.

260
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:25,840
I wonder what
Dad's credit limit is?

261
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,440
Let's find out.

262
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,560
They should be
home with the boys soon.

263
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,800
How's your tea?
Fine, thank you.

264
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,760
Sugar? No, thanks.

265
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,200
That's a pretty
bracelet. Thank you.

266
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:03,990
What kinda stone is that?
Turquoise. Francis got it for me.

267
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:06,090
Oh.

268
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,430
How was your flight?
We took the bus.

269
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:17,310
I guess that's what Francis did with
the money I sent for his plane fare.

270
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:21,400
Plus the bracelet. (CHUCKLES)
Let's talk about something else.

271
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,190
Francis isn't the screw-up
you think he is.

272
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:27,070
Really? Did you know he works
16 hours a day at his job

273
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:30,110
and he still built a
wheelchair ramp for my uncle?

274
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:32,910
In fact - I don't think
we should talk about Francis.

275
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:35,710
Why not? He's my
husband and your son.

276
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:38,830
He and I have a very long
and complicated history together

277
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:41,230
that I don't feel
like explaining to you.

278
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:44,350
Admit it, you
don't like me.

279
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:47,910
I don't even know you.
Well, what would you like to know?

280
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:51,670
I'm 19, my mom ran
off when I was three

281
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:55,750
and my dad kicked me out when I was
14 because I threw out his liquor.

282
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:59,430
I've been married once before,
no kids, thank God,

283
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:03,790
and last year I spent three weeks
in jail, but it wasn't my fault.

284
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:08,880
Will you stop this? You can't stand
for someone in your fancy family
to marry beneath him.

285
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:14,350
What? Just because I'm not
all classy like you.

286
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:17,510
Classy? You think I'm classy?

287
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:21,150
Don't laugh at me. I'm sorry,
it's just this is a first.

288
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:24,720
I hate to break it to you,
but I am not classy. Oh, yeah.

289
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,440
I guess what you call
class, I call manners.

290
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:36,710
I came down here
hoping to get along with you.

291
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:39,360
But you're not
gonna let that happen.

292
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:45,080
You might be surprised at
what I'd let happen.

293
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,390
So,...

294
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:51,490
..what's gonna happen?

295
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,840
I don't know.
What is gonna happen?

296
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,390
(DOOR OPENS) Good news!

297
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:03,470
The boys stole
my credit card!

298
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:06,200
We just have to call
the credit card company and...

299
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,960
Why don't...? Let me
show you my tree house.

300
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:23,390
About time! We called for chocolate
syrup, like, 30 minutes ago!

301
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:26,350
(GASPS) Argh!

302
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:28,350
Hello, Malcolm.

303
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:30,640
(GROANS) Hi, Mom, hi, Dad.

304
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:36,000
Beat it, Vicky. We'll
finish the cuffs later.

305
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:42,070
OK, boys, get your things,
we're going home.

306
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:44,110
No! We're not
going back there!

307
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:46,030
You can't stay
here for ever.

308
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:50,030
What you gonna do,
live under a bridge
and steal food out of dumpsters?

309
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:51,790
We're not going home!

310
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:55,110
We've had it with the way
you treat us and all the yelling!

311
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:57,190
You are a terrible influence on us!

312
00:23:57,290 --> 00:24:00,150
All you ever do is scream!
And order us around!

313
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:02,390
Something's wrong
with this family!

314
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:06,230
Families should have some way of
communicating besides yelling!

315
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:09,230
OK, everybody, calm down.

316
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:11,270
I understand what you're saying,

317
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:14,110
I am not gonna yell,
I am not gonna scream.

318
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:18,070
We are capable of talking about this
without raising our voices.

319
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:22,510
Now, boys, I want you to understand
I'm sorry about what happened.

320
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:25,710
But you have to understand
I get a little emotional

321
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:27,710
when I learn that my oldest son

322
00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:31,030
was acting like an idiot
and throwing his life away.

323
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:33,130
Now, that doesn't mean...

324
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,440
Stop talking about him
like that! Francis is my heart!

325
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:51,990
OK, we're even! Everyone's fine
and there's no need for escalation!

326
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:54,150
Isn't it beautiful
when things work out?

327
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:57,590
It's gone pretty well, considering
we got off to a rocky start.

328
00:24:57,690 --> 00:25:00,230
We couldn't have asked for
a better ending.

329
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:03,720
Get your wife
out of my sight!

330
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,680
(She called you my wife,
that's progress.)

331
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,790
So Dad's birthday
wasn't that bad after all.

332
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:18,910
He got a new back shaver,
we got to eat cake cut by a knife

333
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:21,350
and Mom has promised
not to yell at us any more.

334
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:24,750
Bye, Francis. Bye, Malcolm.
Happy birthday, Dad.

335
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:26,590
Thanks, son.

336
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:28,630
Piama. Lois.

337
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:31,310
Any time you want to finish
our little talk...

338
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:34,790
I'd like that. Maybe
I'll come for a visit.

339
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:36,750
Maybe I'll come
back down here.

340
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:39,030
Any time, any place.

341
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:40,870
Er,... yeah. OK. Bye.

342
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:44,470
(DEWEY SCREAMS) Get
back, you little weasel!

343
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:46,840
Reese!

344
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,510
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
it's all my fault!

345
00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:00,640
I'll clean my room
and do all my homework!

346
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:04,520
We may wanna go back to
the old system.

347
