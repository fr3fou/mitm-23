1
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,830
.

2
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:20,930
My turn.

3
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,560
(FARTING NOISE)

4
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,720
(FARTING NOISE)

5
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,760
Wait, wait.

6
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,670
(FARTING NOISE)

7
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:37,000
I had no idea homework
could be so funny.

8
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,710
It's suicide.

9
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:48,200
I don't care.
I'm going in.

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,590
# Yes, no, maybe

11
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:59,310
# I don't know

12
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:02,590
# Can you repeat the question

13
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:06,790
# You're not the boss of me now
You're not the boss of me now

14
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:11,310
and you're not so big

15
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:15,630
You're not the
boss of me now

16
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:20,670
and you're not so big

17
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:24,120
# Life is unfair #

18
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,510
Guess what? I just
got back from the doctor.

19
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:32,830
My spine is curved!
How bad?

20
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:35,310
No gym for two years.
Brilliant!

21
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:39,190
Maybe my third nipple
can get me out of wrestling.

22
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:43,400
Here comes... Her
Royal... Bitchiness.

23
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:53,190
Cynthia just got back
from a semester in Europe
and she's totally changed.

24
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:57,790
She's bitter and sarcastic.
I could pull it off,

25
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:00,950
but on her it's
really unpleasant.

26
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:07,430
Malcolm, can you move the herd
to move an inch to the left
so I could get past?

27
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:09,870
I'm sorry, did you say inch?

28
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:14,470
Don't you mean 2.54 centimetres
or 0.254 decimetres,

29
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:16,990
or 25.4 million nanometres?

30
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:22,630
Guys, stop teasing her. You stink
at it. Don't defend her, Malcolm.

31
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:26,670
If I wanted abuse
I'd talk to my oboe teacher.

32
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:29,870
She's... dead...

33
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:31,970
to us.

34
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,950
Hey. Are you OK?

35
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:40,390
What do you mean?

36
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:42,710
You've been acting kinda strange.

37
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:47,840
Malcolm, look around and reconsider
your definition of strange.

38
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,680
Fair enough.

39
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,390
Dad, look how
high my kite is!

40
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:00,790
That's great,
son. That's terrific.

41
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:03,950
You wanna try?
Er, no.

42
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:06,190
Why not?
I don't like kites.

43
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:11,550
Why not? I don't like kites and they
don't like me. We don't get along.

44
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:14,430
You'd like it
if you tried it.

45
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:17,430
Come on, just try it.
Hold the string.

46
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,840
(SIGHS HEAVILY)

47
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,630
Agh!
Hey, Lois.

48
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:36,070
Karen, what are
you doing out there?

49
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:38,110
Come on in.

50
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:42,880
Sorry. I didn't mean to lurk. I was
working up the nerve to talk to you.

51
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,030
Are you OK?

52
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:49,190
You look different.
I'm sober.

53
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:55,350
Oh. Yeah. After I drove over that
miniature golfcourse they made me
get into a 12-step programme.

54
00:03:55,450 --> 00:04:02,310
Good for you! Thanks. I'm up to
the part where I'm supposed to make
amends to people I've hurt.

55
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:09,080
What did you ever do to me? Remember
New Year's at Deb and Rich's where
everyone was kissing at midnight?

56
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:14,710
Yeah. When I kissed your husband
I stuck my tongue in his mouth.

57
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:20,870
I felt terrible, then I put my
cigarette out on Richard's toupee...

58
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:23,630
You were French-kissing my husband?

59
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:27,070
He pushed me away after, like,
five or six seconds.

60
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:29,830
Well, no more than ten.

61
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:36,310
I'm sure he was only moving his
tongue because he was trying to say
something. That's enough, Karen.

62
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:37,670
Sorry.

63
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:42,440
Now I have to tell Stephanie she can
take down those lost-dog posters.

64
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:49,310
Francis, it's Friday night. Can
we please go out and get hammered?

65
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:51,990
Is getting drunk
all you think about?

66
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:56,430
We work like dogs all day, drink,
then work like hungover dogs.

67
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,910
Is this how you
pictured your life?

68
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:02,950
Ever since I was little. What did
you picture? I don't know.

69
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:08,680
There's more to life than falling
down drunk and acting like a jackass.

70
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,430
Look what we found!

71
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:13,870
(LAUGHTER)

72
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:16,870
You stole a totem pole?

73
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:20,870
No, he asked to come with us.
He hasn't shut up for an hour.

74
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:26,150
You can't leave it here. People
worship these. It's a sacred object.

75
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:31,150
Do I have something in my teeth?
Be honest. What's wrong with you?

76
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:35,550
You see a symbol of a world beyond
scraping grease and you think,

77
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:37,870
let's profane
it in our cabin?

78
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:40,520
Don't you have
respect for anything?

79
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,910
Look, a penny! It's mine!
I saw it first!

80
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:46,150
(SCUFFLING)

81
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,430
Is my coffee ready yet?

82
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:53,670
I can't believe
you only have instant. Sorry
it's not up to your standards.

83
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:58,430
You'd seem more sophisticated if you
weren't wearing a kiddies' sweater.

84
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:04,430
I'd take style tips from someone
who keeps track of wrestling feuds?

85
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:10,030
Ever since you've been back
you've been mean. You think you're
better than us. Even if it's true,

86
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:14,750
you don't have the right to be nasty.
You won't have any friends soon.

87
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:18,310
You think you know
what everybody's problem is?

88
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:24,630
You think you're so smart and
together, and no-one notices what
an unhappy little person you are.

89
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:30,310
Well, sorry. I won't stroke your
fragile ego by confiding in you.

90
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:33,190
Oh, yeah? Well,
you're on fire!

91
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:35,290
Aaaagh!

92
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,390
Mommy!

93
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,790
How could you
do that to me?

94
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:56,750
You were on fire. I wanted to help.
By yelling, "Oh, my God, where did
those come from?" I'm sorry!

95
00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:00,030
It's just, you scared me.
THEY scared me.

96
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:02,390
I mean, they startled me...

97
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:06,910
I hate this! Everyone looks at me
like I'm some kind of freak.

98
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:09,110
I was surprised, that's all.

99
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:14,710
I mean, I would react the same way
if you had a new haircut.

100
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:16,750
(A giant haircut!)

101
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:20,190
No-one can know about this.
You can't tell anyone.

102
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:22,430
What?
Promise me!

103
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:25,910
But... Promise!
Alright, I promise!

104
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:28,470
Come on, you're fine.

105
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:31,350
It's just a change on the outside.

106
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:36,630
Inside you're the same. If you give
people a chance they'll see that.

107
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:38,630
Stop staring at them!

108
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:40,870
Am I staring?

109
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:44,790
Dad, I've been thinking
about your kite problem.

110
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:48,390
I don't have a kite
problem! It's OK, Dad.

111
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:52,440
We could start with you
explaining why you hate kites.

112
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:57,430
Let me try it! I want
to try it! Fine. Here.

113
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:59,530
Jerk!

114
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,720
Help!

115
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:17,480
I just do! There
doesn't need to be a reason!

116
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,750
Doesn't Dewey get homework? He seems
to have a lot of time on his hands.

117
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:29,510
Something wrong? I had the most
interesting conversation with Karen.

118
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:34,310
She's in this programme where you
have to apologise to your loved ones

119
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:38,790
and I wondered, do I have
anything to apologise for?

120
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:43,550
By you, you mean ME, and since it's
a question, you know the answer.

121
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:48,470
Karen said you French-kissed her
on New Year's Eve. I did not!

122
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:54,870
I can't believe it!
You're actually accusing me of this?
Why would Karen lie?

123
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:56,870
Why would I lie?

124
00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:01,070
For the past 20 years yours
has been the only tongue

125
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:04,190
that's been in my mouth.
I don't lie!

126
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:09,230
So can we fly kites tomorrow?
Sorry, son I have to testify
at a murder trial.

127
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:13,310
But, darn it, I'll go to the park
with you! Thanks, Dad.

128
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:18,750
(Kids don't count.) It wouldn't be
so bad if you'd just admit it. Lois,

129
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:23,070
why would I kiss Karen?
You're a MAN!

130
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:29,230
What's that supposed to mean? You've
been with the same woman for 20
years. It's natural to be curious.

131
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:30,630
About what?

132
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:36,270
In 20 years of marriage you've never
even thought about another woman?

133
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:38,510
What are you talking about?

134
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:41,510
If you're just
gonna be ridiculous,

135
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:46,440
there's no point in carrying on this
conversation. But you are on notice!

136
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:56,200
Wait! I wanna talk to you!

137
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,670
(DEEP VOICE) You are unhappy!

138
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:04,510
Yes, I am.
Why?

139
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:09,630
I may have ruined my life. I left my
family and friends to come up here.

140
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:13,110
I wanted to find myself,
but all I feel is empty.

141
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:17,470
I have the answer to your suffering,
Francis. The answer is...

142
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:22,870
Francis! Who was that spiky-haired
kid who was friends with Little Lou?

143
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:23,950
What...?

144
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:28,160
Don't worry. Maybe it'll
come to you if you sleep on it.

145
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,440
.

146
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:39,120
The diamond standard of dishwashing
won't come from a dirty dishwasher.

147
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,480
Finish Dishwasher Cleaner is far
better at removing hidden grease

148
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,780
and limescale.

149
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,880
And a cleaner dishwasher
means cleaner dishes.

150
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,300
It's only dishwashing,

151
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,560
but you deserve perfect
results every time.

# ORGAN

153
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,980
TINKLING/WHOOSH!

154
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,820
# DRUMBEAT

155
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,380
(giggles)

156
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,980
Feel
fresh:

157
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,900
..with new Dove
go fresh deodorant

158
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,200
in energising
grapefruit & lemongrass.

159
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,320
Stay dry, go fresh.

160
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,240
Because kids never stay still,

161
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,360
Garnier
has created:

162
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,100
Upwards or
downwards,

163
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,180
the continuous
spray

164
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,400
can cover every inch
of the body rapido,

165
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,920
to provide advanced UV protection.

166
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,060
Garnier suncare research

167
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,160
is recognised
by:

168
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,200
And always remember
to wrap on a T-shirt,

169
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,940
splat on sun cream

170
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,180
and wear a hat.

171
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,280
No one makes the sun safer.

172
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,080
You know when your cat
doesn't want to know.

173
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:12,200
You'll know when he doesn't
want to be disturbed.

174
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,840
And you'll know when he
wants something he really likes.

175
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,920
Like new tastier
Whiskas pouches.

176
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:27,160
Gently steam-cooked
for total satisfaction.

177
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,060
Not a morning person?

178
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,160
Wake up with...

179
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,940
..enriched with caffeine.

180
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,020
The cooling moisturiser
instantly hydrates

181
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,940
and refreshes
tired-looking eyes.

182
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,040
The roll-on massages the eye area

183
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,200
for a
bright-eyed look.

184
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,620
One sold every
30 seconds.

185
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,720
Got yours?

186
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:12,830
Everything's ready. The kite tail is
set. It's a windy day. Now SAY it!

187
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:14,910
I am not cursed!

188
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:18,680
Good. Now run. And don't stop
until it's in the air.

189
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:25,040
I am not cursed!
I am not cursed!

190
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,630
Get off the field!

191
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:33,730
Excuse me!

192
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,800
Sorry!

193
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:41,920
It's flying! It's flying!

194
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:50,630
(CROAKY LAUGH) You guys threw fridge
magnets at Dabney's back brace?

195
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:55,550
He was walking around all day with
"Florida is for Lovers" on his back.

196
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:59,670
(SQUEAKY LAUGH)
That laugh is so not cute.

197
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:04,070
I'm sorry my laugh isn't as
melodious as your cracking voice.

198
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:08,630
(CRACKING) I'm Malcolm. I have all
the answers but no-one listens to me

199
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:10,730
Funny! (STUPID LAUGH)

200
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,150
This was fun.

201
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:18,250
Hi, Reese.

202
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,670
What a pig!
What?

203
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:28,190
She was never that great, but now
it's like she's TRYING to be ugly.

204
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:33,310
Shut up! She's not in Europe any
more. In America, we take showers.

205
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:35,110
She doesn't smell.

206
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:39,230
She dresses like a bag lady.
I know, her butt is gigantic

207
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:42,310
and she's trying to
hide it. This is great!

208
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:46,910
I have a wide-load sticker,
and I can make the truck noise

209
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:50,310
when she backs up
- beep, beep, beep!

210
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:52,950
Reese, when is
she gonna back up?

211
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:59,280
OK. When's her lunch period? I can
sneak in and throw bacon at her.
THEN she'll back up. Beep, beep...

212
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:03,550
She's not hiding her butt,
she's hiding her big boobs!

213
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:07,670
So if you tease her
you're just gonna look like a....

214
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:10,830
You are a good, good brother.

215
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:12,550
No...

216
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:15,200
I lied! Her butt IS huge!

217
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:21,310
I think it helped Cynthia to talk.
She's in a better mood.

218
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:24,830
She even stuck her homework
on Dabney's back.

219
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:27,280
Agh! What're you doing?!
Algebra.

220
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,550
What did he say to you?

221
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:36,550
Malcolm, calm down! I'm just
helping him with his homework.

222
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:39,870
Reese doesn't care
about school. So I thought,

223
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:46,120
but when he asked me for help
he sounded so pathetic,
I couldn't say no.

224
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:49,270
How are you doing on number five?

225
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:54,030
Awful. I'm not gonna get this.
I'm such an idiot. No, you're not.

226
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:57,230
Everyone says I'm
an idiot all the time.

227
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:59,670
Well, he IS!
Malcolm.

228
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:05,830
It's not his fault. Someone at some
point decided I was dumb, and that's
all anyone ever sees in me.

229
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:10,120
Why do they always focus on one
detail, never the whole person?

230
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,520
I don't know.

231
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:22,710
You missed another shift! I'm not
walking away from this totem pole

232
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:27,750
when I'm this close to figuring out
what it's trying to tell me.

233
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:31,830
Have you eaten anything?
Fasting helps my meditation.

234
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:35,790
There's some kind of energy here.
It gave me that dream.

235
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:37,990
It's trying to help me.

236
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:43,080
We're getting rid of it
and putting you back on corn dogs
and porn for your own safety.

237
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,150
Back away from the pole!

238
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,990
So...

239
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:54,190
you guys wanna go...
shoot some eagles?

240
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:56,290
Nothin' else to do.

241
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:09,270
What're you gonna do to her? I don't
know what you're talking about.

242
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:13,230
OK. I've been dying to tell someone.
Malcolm, I'm gonna see them.

243
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:17,550
What?! I'll make her my girlfriend
and get her to take her top off.

244
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:21,720
You're crazy! That's what I thought,
but I've got it all figured out.

245
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:29,750
Tomorrow I reveal an embarrassing
secret that makes her feel trusted.

246
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:34,230
Friday, sneak a kiss, then
apologise. Monday, I ask her out.

247
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:38,510
She catches me crying. Make out.
She finds love letter in my pocket.

248
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:43,480
Heavier make-out session.
All culminating in March 8, DD-Day.

249
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,710
You're pure evil!
Who's more evil,

250
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:51,110
me or the person who told me?

251
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:58,480
You! Yeah, but YOU'D be in trouble.
She'd never forgive you. Excuse me.
I have to go make a mix tape.

252
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,110
OK, we had a little setback,
but don't give up.

253
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:05,670
Forget it!

254
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:07,870
I'm sick of this!

255
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:11,070
I hate kites! I
have always hated kites!

256
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:14,990
Dad, don't freak out
in front of the other kids.

257
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:18,830
I'm never gonna get this
and I don't want to!

258
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:23,030
You can't give up.
I can give up, and I give up!

259
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:26,590
I'm tired of your attitude.
I'm going home.

260
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:31,360
Dewey! Dewey, come back here.
It's too far for you to walk.

261
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,080
Dewey!

262
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:38,120
Dewey, stop!

263
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,270
Dewey!

264
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:43,990
Don't you ever run
away like that again.

265
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:47,600
There's something
on the back of your pants.

266
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:56,320
I'm flying a kite!
I'm flying a kite!

267
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:02,470
Lois, I did it! I did
it! I actually flew a kite!

268
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:06,070
How could I think these
were evil? I love this kite.

269
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:12,270
Why don't you kiss it?
For God's sake! Are you still
obsessing about that?

270
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:19,510
I want a straight answer. Lois,
from the moment I laid eyes on you
YOU were the only woman for me.

271
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:24,750
Unlike all other men,
you don't even have a glancing
interest in other women?

272
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:28,910
You alone stand outside the dictates
of millions of years of evolution!

273
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:31,710
Why is that so hard
for you to believe?

274
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:34,120
Because I look at other men!

275
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:39,190
Not seriously. I would
never do anything about it,

276
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:41,550
but, God, hell, I notice!

277
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:44,360
And if you don't, it means that...

278
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:50,550
..it means that you love me
more than I love you.

279
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:55,350
Well, honey, that's always been
true. Of course I love you more.

280
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:58,390
You're OK with that?
Oh, yeah.

281
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:03,630
If you loved me as much as I love
you, we'd never leave the bedroom!

282
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:06,760
Nothing would get done.
We'd die of starvation.

283
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,800
I love you!

284
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,630
Not as much as I love you.

285
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:17,270
I have fasted,
I have meditated,

286
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:21,070
I got frostbite from a
night in the wilderness!

287
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:26,150
I just want to know what to do.
What am I missing? There's a wolf.

288
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:29,950
What's that? Loyalty.

289
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:31,190
Eagle.

290
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:34,110
OK, insight... insight...
The frog is...

291
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:36,430
bug-eating!

292
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:39,670
What does that have to do
with anything?

293
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:44,720
Please just give me a sign
or a signal, or something!

294
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,710
Oh, my God!

295
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:51,510
Are you the dirtbag
that took my pole?

296
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:56,230
Huh? It's my pole. I
want it back. Oh, of course!

297
00:22:56,330 --> 00:22:58,870
I'm so sorry. I
didn't take it.

298
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:03,070
I'm going crazy. Can
you tell me what it means?

299
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:10,390
Well, if I hit it, it means I'm five
inches away from the back of my
carport. You use it as a wheel-stop?

300
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:14,110
This beautiful, sacred thing?
Sacred? It's a decoration.

301
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:17,270
Like a coat of
arms or a storybook.

302
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:21,190
It's a pretty chunk of wood
my kids helped me carve.

303
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:24,550
But you can't tell me
you can't feel the energy!

304
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:28,110
You white boys all think
cos I've got dark skin,

305
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:32,510
I dance with the bears and listen
to the spirit of the wind.

306
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:35,390
I got news for you -
I work for a living.

307
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:38,790
I'm a Baptist,
and I'm proud of it.

308
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:41,350
But... you sure?

309
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:45,230
And by the way, I have
only one word for snow -

310
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:47,330
snow!

311
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,480
(GIGGLING) >

312
00:23:55,720 --> 00:24:00,270
No! Stop! Malcolm!
He's not who you think he is.

313
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:05,430
Reese is only interested in you
cos I told him you have big breasts.

314
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:08,350
What?! It just
happened. I'm sorry.

315
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:11,790
He only wants you for
your boobs! Stop saying that!

316
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:15,030
He planned all
this. I can prove it.

317
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:20,430
He wrote it all down. This isn't it.
Where's your REAL calendar?

318
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:24,470
That IS my calendar. All proceeds
went to animal shelters.

319
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:27,710
He's using you
and you fell for it!

320
00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:31,030
Leave me alone!
You heard her.

321
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:33,150
But...

322
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:36,670
What's her name?
What?

323
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:39,320
What's her name?

324
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:45,310
I know what her name is.

325
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:48,630
And I'm not gonna
dignify that with a response.

326
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:52,280
I know what her name is,
and her name is...

327
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,790
Ohhh!

328
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:01,110
How could you
be so creepy?

329
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:06,110
Don't you have any sense of decency
towards a fellow human being?

330
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:10,590
(THUDDING) I have feelings!
I will be treated with respect!

331
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:15,030
I will not be objectified!
I will not be humiliated!

332
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:17,230
Now kiss my shoe!

333
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:19,510
Kiss... my... shoe!

334
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:24,030
The private says, "But, General,
I didn't touch your toast!"

335
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:27,590
(SQUEAKY LAUGH)
Something's different about you.

336
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:30,070
Did you get a haircut?

337
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:31,590
Very stylish.

338
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:36,870
(DOORBELL RINGS) Cynthia,
did you like Europe? I did.

339
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:43,430
I forget sometimes that there's
a whole world out there that's not
full of prurient adolescent boys.

340
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:48,190
There are people who treat me nicely
and keep their mouths shut.

341
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:50,290
I get it!

342
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,390
Yes?
Is Lois here?

343
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:55,270
Honey?
Oh, God,

344
00:25:55,370 --> 00:26:02,510
are you Lois' husband?
So who's married to the bald guy
with the earring? Donna.

345
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:06,830
I thought that was one house
I didn't have to go to.

346
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:08,430
Excuse me.

347
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:13,350
Oh, I lived in your house while
you were on vacation last month.

348
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:16,560
We didn't go on
vacation. Darn it!

349
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,030

You're looking at the
standard we set ourselves.

352
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:37,240
It's the one standard
that measures the shine,

353
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,300
the clarity

354
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:42,680
and the brilliance you get
with Finish Quantum.

355
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,940
It's only dishwashing,

356
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:49,680
but we believe you deserve
flawless results every time.
