It's important to
protect your teeth

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,440
from the build-up
of invisible plaque.

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,880
But how do you fight
something that's invisible?

4
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,460
Simple.

Orbit Complete with xylitol

teeth from plaque.

This is stupid!
We didn't do anything!

19
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:51,830
What do we need a psychiatrist for?
We need professional help.

20
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:56,030
Hello. Thanks for squeezing us in.
Why do we all have to be here?

He's the one who's afraid of sharks
in the shower. He doesn't walk in
his sleep and pee on the TV.

22
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:05,870
My wife told you about the car?
Yes, the joyriding incident.

23
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:08,110
$700 worth of damage!

24
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:12,190
We are at our wits' end. I authorise
you to do whatever it takes.

25
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:16,270
Drugs, brainwashing, electroshock -
Maybe I'll start with talking.

26
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:20,120
You're the expert. You
do whatever the doctor says.

27
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,950
You better be
cured when I get back!

28
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:29,550
Well, looks like we have
some work to do, don't we?

29
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:31,650
Take a seat.

30
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:39,550
So, let's go over the
ground rules. This is a safe zone.

31
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:43,910
And what that means is when
one of you talks, everybody listens.

32
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:48,070
And listening does not include
interrupting, name-calling, or

33
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:53,190
passing judgment on what was said.
Everybody can say what they want,

34
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:57,560
and feel OK about it.
Can I have a piece of candy? No.

35
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,110
This is ridiculous!
We didn't take their car!

36
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:08,030
We were watching TV. We were good. I
had stuff scheduled for later, but -

37
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:12,150
A lot of damage was done to the car.
Somebody else must have driven it.

38
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:15,470
OK, let's back up.
Let's talk about the home.

39
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:21,190
There's a leak in the roof over
my bed. No, about your family life.

40
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:26,390
Look, don't analyse us. You can
poke and prod and delve all you want,

41
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:30,550
but you're not gonna find any
psychological issues. We're normal.

Soon as I can, honey.

00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:51,080
I said stop it!

What'd you do?
What?

49
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:24,470
Don't give me that.
What'd you do? Nothing.

50
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:27,590
Mom, I'm trying to study.
Oh!

51
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:32,110
So you don't mind if I, er,
took a look in here!

52
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:36,310
Mom, I'm telling you,
we didn't do anything.

53
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:39,520
You boys are up to
something. I can smell it.

00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:55,120
This time.

00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,120
(CREAK!)

58
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:12,360
(CREAK!)
That was close.

59
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,150
Our only problem is our parents
think we're lying and we're not.

60
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:21,510
Hey! A breakthrough! You're
obviously a very bright young man.

61
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:25,440
Would you like to spend the hour
telling me how bright you are?

62
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:32,640
OK, let's talk about your parents.
Now, if you had to describe them in
a few words, how would you do that?

63
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:37,670
I don't know. Mom is...

64
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:40,280
..Mom.

65
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,560
Everybody up!

66
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,990
Aagh! Arrgh!
Aargh!

67
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:54,710
I need to do laundry before work!
Aaagh!

68
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:59,310
Agh! I am taking breakfast
off the table in five minutes.

69
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:01,470
And Dad's...

70
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:03,680
What is Dad?

71
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,150
Who wants to make five bucks?
How?

72
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:12,590
I need someone to take the fall.
'Oh, my God!' What did you do?

73
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:16,550
I can't tell you. Yes or no.
No questions asked. 'Oh, my God!'

74
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:19,230
Make it ten.
Done.

75
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:22,710
OH, MY GOD! Good
son. I got him, honey.

76
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:25,310
I got him, don't worry!

77
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:29,510
You have another brother, Francis?
Did I tell you what they did to him?

78
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:33,270
Classic first-born scenario -
a free-and-easy couple has a kid

79
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:37,270
and their world's turned upside down.
Even after other kids, the oldest one

80
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:41,480
is a symbol for everything wrong in
their lives, through no fault of his.

81
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,390
Dad, I know what you're gonna say,
and believe me, I totally agree.

82
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:50,390
There is no excuse for what I did.
It was idiotic, immature,

83
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:54,990
totally reckless, and I'm really
sorry. I'm just hoping against hope,

84
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:58,910
you will give me another chance,
which I admit, I don't deserve.

85
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:02,710
But if you could just find it
in your heart to forgive me,

86
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:05,670
I know I could
earn your trust back.

87
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:09,830
They had it out for him from the
start. You kids have a lot of issues

88
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:15,630
with your parents. Do you ever
discuss any of this with them?

89
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:19,230
You never tell your parents
your feelings? We try.

90
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:23,790
I put newspapers in the blender and
set it on fire as a cry for help.

91
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:28,350
I mean talk, with words, you know,
talk about the subject at hand.

92
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:32,590
You know, a lot of families do that,
er, round the dinner table.

93
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:36,640
That can be a really good
environment to share your feelings.

94
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,550
Great pancakes, Dad(!)

95
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:54,950
Oh, thanks! Hey,
who's ready for seconds?

96
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:57,640
(CHOKES) I am.

97
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:06,070
Here are the house rules -
you can't reach for seconds
until you're finished.

98
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:09,880
But if a fork leaves the perimeter
of the plate, all bets are off.

99
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,190
It's mine!

100
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:38,230
There's a big explosion and bubbles.
That's where babies come from.

101
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:40,350
(ALL LAUGH)

102
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:43,310
You know what? Close enough!

103
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:45,870
Look at this - I
made a pea angel.

104
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:49,310
You're a pea, angel!
Stop playing with your food.

105
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:51,920
(ALL LAUGH)

106
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:58,870
Oh, Mom! Don't you dare.
Relax. I wasn't really going to.

107
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:04,070
Then, don't. I wasn't
going to. Then, don't.

108
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:07,640
Don't accuse me of something
I wasn't going to do.

109
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:13,470
Interesting mood shift. It would take
hours to explain the psychology.

110
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:18,470
So let me just put it this way.
Dynamite. Kid with matches.

111
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:23,270
Are you gonna throw that at Mom?
I wasn't going to. Jeez, Louise.

112
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:26,990
I can handle this.
Reese, I'm warning you.

113
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:32,310
I wasn't going to. But if you think
I would, I should. He's panicking.

114
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:39,110
Just put the spoon down and
apologise. OK, she gave him an out.

115
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:44,270
What? I wasn't gonna do anything!
Just stop talking and let me think!

116
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:46,640
Dad, do something.
I got it.

117
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,110
What do you think you're doing?

118
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:07,560
I'm being cute
and spontaneous?

119
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,000
(BOTH LAUGH)

120
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,670
(ALL LAUGH)

121
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:21,520
Splat!
(ALL LAUGH)

122
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:27,670
Don't do it.
I wasn't going to!

123
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:31,550
Well, I got this far in life
without anyone believing me.

124
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:35,590
Why should anything
be different now?

125
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:40,150
A guy who leaves thumbtacks on the
toilet seat's misunderstood(!) Hey!

126
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:44,230
You taught me my name in French
was "latrine"! Don't interrupt.

127
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:47,710
You sold my bike for $3 the day we
moved to Canada! We don't -

128
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:52,110
I spit in Dewey's cereal this
morning. I mean - I drank that!

129
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:56,750
I licked the bowl! I hate you!
Shut up, pit-stain! You started it!

130
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:59,480
Shut up! You shut
up! Shut up! Stop it!

131
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,990
This is not how therapy works!

132
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:08,030
You are going to respect each other,
and, dammit, going to respect me.

133
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:12,840
You're gonna behave, and continue
with this session. Understood?

134
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:22,230
Stop it! This is a
safe zone! (SCREAMS)

135
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:25,680
A safe zone!
Stupid... Aargh!

136
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,160
Lamisil Once is a revolution in
Athlete's Foot treatment.

137
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,400
Only one single
application and you're done.

138
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,520
Lamisil Once.

139
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,400
Look, Mum, this
colour's perfect!

140
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,500
Your dress?

141
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,700
No, Mum,
my hair.

142
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,540
It's new:

143
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,340
Now with double
the avocado oil.

144
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,260
My colour stays
looking so rich.

145
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,540
Will it do
my bit of grey?

146
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,100
All your grey,
Mum.

147
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,740
New:

148
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,840
Nourished hair, better colour.

149
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,440
Add a touch of sunshine
to your hair with:

150
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,020
Enriched with avocado oil.

00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,400
Simply brush in for radiant,
subtle highlights.

152
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,500
Because nourished hair

153
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,580
means better
highlights.

154
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,680
New:

155
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,780
Fact - you can
immunise your family

156
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,540
against many infectious diseases.

157
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,260
But not the most common of all:

158
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,500
food poisoning,

159
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,020
often caught from raw meat

160
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,660
and the surfaces it touches.

161
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,620
But use Dettol
Surface Cleanser

162
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,080
to kill 99.9% of bacteria

163
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,200
wherever food
has been prepared

164
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,460
or stored,

165
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,560
without leaving a
taste in your mouth.

166
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,080
Dettol protects. Fact.

167
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:16,600
Dettol Handwash also kills harmful
bacteria on your hands. Fact.

168
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:49,630
Here's what you
boys need to know.

169
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:54,110
You cannot break me.
I worked in prisons!

170
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:57,950
I had a 17-year-old
serial killer hugging my knees

171
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:02,710
and crying like a little girl.
Those aren't Fisher Price diplomas -

172
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:07,390
I went to Harvard. I had a
starring role in The Mikado!

173
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:11,670
(My arms are tired.) (Don't
give him the satisfaction, Dewey.)

174
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:18,080
This is nothing. Mom makes us do
this in the rain. OK, you can relax.

175
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,950
(SIGHS)

176
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:29,430
Try this. If you picked one thing
about how your parents treat you,

177
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:31,990
what would you change? The biggest
problem is that they don't trust us.

178
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:35,910
They assume if they leave
us alone, we'll get in trouble.

179
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:38,520
Nine days past expiration.

180
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,640
Urgh!

181
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,110
Expired two months ago.

182
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:49,680
You don't have the guts.

183
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,910
Bleurgh!

184
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:03,360
When was the last Christmas
we had eggnog? I think before Dewey.

185
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,950
(FIZZING)

186
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:13,070
It's all you, man.
(COUGHS)

187
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:16,790
Bottom of the ninth.
Two outs. Man on first.

188
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:20,120
The wind up... The pitch...

189
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,470
Uh-oh.
Oh, man, we are so dead!

190
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:28,390
That's it. Game over!
Yeah. So I win.

191
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:33,070
What? Past the lamp is a home run.
Two men score. That was a foul ball!

192
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:37,070
Are you crazy? It was down
the line! It was foul! Shut up!

193
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:41,920
You're home plate, you
don't vote. Do over. Fine by me.

194
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,230
Oh, crap! Now we
really have to quit.

195
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:51,080
Yeah. But that was
a triple. Get back up.

196
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:56,710
Let me ask you -
how do you see yourselves?

197
00:18:56,810 --> 00:19:01,230
Reese, what do you think
your role in the family is?

198
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:05,270
I guess I'm the bad boy.
The one that ruins everything.

199
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:09,710
Every family has that guy. He makes
you cry, makes you hate coming home

200
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:14,110
at the end of the day knowing I'm
gonna be there. It's a lot of work.

201
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:17,360
But I guess it's
pretty satisfying.

202
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:29,430
What are you looking
at, monkey-boy? Ow! Ow! Ow!

203
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:32,670
Reese! What are you doing?
Help, ow, help!

204
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:35,670
Mom, help! Ow, ow!
Cut it out!

205
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:39,750
Help, it hurts! Ow! Knock
it off, you little - Reese!

206
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:44,270
What the heck are you doing? God,
you can't leave him for five minutes

207
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:47,750
without picking on him!
I didn't do anything! No!

208
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:52,470
What you looking at? Reese's report
card. Much better than last time.

209
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:56,870
Really? He used the same brand
of pen as the teacher
to change his grade!

210
00:19:56,970 --> 00:20:00,870
Look! He gave himself a C in Math
instead of an A-plus. Yeah.

211
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:07,790
Subtle. Nice attention to detail.
He's really learning. Two months
grounded? Three, scrubbing toilets.

212
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:12,710
And how do you see your place in
this family? Er, I'm the favourite.

213
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:15,510
The one everybody loves the most.

214
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:20,470
The cute one. The one everybody
looks out for and gives presents to,

215
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:25,670
sometimes even make the birds sing
to me, and the clouds spell my name.

216
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:28,870
(PANTS) Come on!

217
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:31,680
You said I could play!

218
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:41,590
You have to go down there again. No!
You're the only one that'll fit.

219
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:45,390
No, I always go get it,
and you never let me play.

220
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:48,670
We'll let you play.
We promise.

221
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:50,910
(GRUNTS)

222
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:53,950
Come on! Throw here!

223
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:57,830
You promised!
No way!

224
00:20:57,930 --> 00:21:02,230
(GROANS) Agh!
What, can't sleep?

225
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:06,390
No, I have this terrible feeling
we've forgotten something.

226
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:09,440
Trash, locks, lights...

227
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:18,040
Oh, well, whatever it is, I'm sure
it can wait till the morning.

228
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,440
Oh, my...

229
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:32,510
Alright, son. Son, I think
you've learned your lesson. OK.

230
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:37,480
Thanks, Dad.
Gotta stop doing this.

231
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:44,760
Hup! Aaaarrrrggghhhh!
(CRASH!) Agh!

232
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:52,590
I try not to throw it in their faces
but sometimes I can't help it.

233
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:57,230
What about you, Malcolm?
What's your place in the family?

234
00:21:57,330 --> 00:22:02,840
I dunno, I'm the middle one. Think.
How do you fit in with this family?

235
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,870
Well, I...

236
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:10,790
Go ahead.
Well, I guess I...

237
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:12,950
..don't.

238
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:16,390
I don't fit in.
I mean, honestly,

239
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:21,510
sometimes I feel I've been dropped
into this family from outer space.

240
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:25,950
Well, that's interesting. Now, how -
He's the one that fixes everything.

241
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:30,310
What? Yeah, he figures everything out
and solves a lot of our problems.

242
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:34,870
Yeah, kinda like that gay kid with
the scarf in Scooby Doo. The leader.

243
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:37,360
You guys think that?

244
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:43,070
Sure, they do. I mean, it's pretty
obvious that you're the ringleader.

245
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:45,750
What?
It happens all the time.

246
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:49,710
An intelligent, sensitive kid
with poor impulse control,

247
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:53,710
surrounded by people who
don't challenge you mentally.

248
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:56,990
You get bored and
look for trouble. I don't!

249
00:22:57,090 --> 00:22:59,710
Isn't that what
happened last night?

250
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:04,110
You were sitting with your brothers,
nothing to do but watch TV,

251
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:05,950
thinking the way to end the crushing
boredom was to stir up excitement?

252
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:10,350
He didn't do it! None of us did!
There's a lot of options for you.

253
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:16,030
There's placement programmes,
camps, special schools -
You wanna send me away?

254
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:20,790
You can't do that! He's our brother!
I merely suggested - I'm not going!

255
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:23,480
You can't make him!
We're good kids!

256
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,800
"(ALARM BUZZES)"

257
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:39,360
Agh! Aargh!

258
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,870
Oh! Argh!

259
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:45,240
Aarrgh!

260
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,950
Aaarghhh! Oooh!

261
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:57,320
Al!
I'm late for work!

262
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,390
Aarghh!

263
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:08,440
Don't do this! You can't leave me
alone with Reese! We're out of time.

264
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:18,390
What is the deal with this door?
Is there some kind of baffling

265
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:22,390
built into it? You have three
very special boys here.

266
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:27,030
I'd like to sit with you and
your wife - Dad, he wants to send -

267
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:31,390
Malcolm, let me talk to the doctor.
Maybe we ought to speak privately.

268
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:35,830
Sure. Boys, go wait
in the car. (SMASH!)

269
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:38,590
'What the hell - ?!'
'Everyone alright?'

270
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:42,270
What! That's my car!

271
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:46,270
I know I set the brake!
See! Just like the other night.

272
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:50,110
We didn't take it out.
It just rolled out by itself!

273
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:53,950
You boys were
actually telling us the truth?

274
00:24:54,050 --> 00:25:00,750
You're a genius! Boys, let's go get
you some ice cream, huh?

275
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:04,390
Listen, there's a lot we
haven't - Oh, absolutely!

276
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:08,830
Doc, I have no idea how you did it.
In just an hour! I'm putting in
a little extra for ya.

277
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:11,240
But -
Thanks.

278
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:18,030
Oh, isn't it great to feel
like a family again? Cheers!

279
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:21,950
Stop touching me! I'm not,
I was clipping on my tie.

280
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:24,670
While you were
touching me. Stop it!

281
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:28,950
Why do we have to do this? We don't
have a picture of us all together.

282
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:33,350
We're a family - we should have a
family portrait. Francis isn't here.

283
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:37,430
I'm not gonna cough up $200
to fly him in for one silly picture.

284
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:41,990
Where's Dewey? Dewey, get out
of there - that's not your family.

285
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:45,590
You sure you want Autumn Leaves
as a backdrop? Yes!

286
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:51,270
You didn't even look at Happy
Windmills. It's more colourful.
Ooh, Space Shuttle! Next!

287
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:55,790
I have a coupon for one 8x10 and two
wallet size for $9.99. I want that.

288
00:25:55,890 --> 00:26:01,710
Not the Golden Moments,
Family and Friends Collection
or the Lifetime of Love.

289
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:05,070
I want one 8x10 and
two wallet size for $9.99.

290
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:08,950
Fine. We have an
instalment plan, if that would help.

291
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:13,430
I brought a picture of Francis so
he's in the portrait. I'll hold it.

292
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:18,950
I'm gonna hold it. Let go!
Come on! Dewey, pants on, mister.

293
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:24,470
Sorry, this coupon's expired. What?!
What you want'll run you $39.50.

294
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:28,710
Ooh! Lonely Beach! We're kind
of a Lonely Beach family. Hal!

295
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:34,510
Another $5 and you have
the Instant Memories set
with double-exposure silhouettes.

296
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:39,190
Please just do what I'm asking you -
I'm older! It was my idea!
(RIP!) Yaarrgghhhh!

297
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:42,830
That is it!

298
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:45,830
Get up! Get back!

299
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:48,430
Come here! Go there!

300
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:52,390
We are gonna take this picture,
and it is gonna be good.

301
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:55,190
And that means no
faces, no tongues,

302
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:59,190
no crossed eyes, no bunny ears.
We are gonna smile and look good,

303
00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:03,670
it will cost $9.99, and all this'll
happen by the time I count three.

304
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:05,670
One. (ALL SHOUT)
Two. Three.

305
00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:08,640
(ALL SHOUT)

00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,060
The trouble with bleach

309
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,980
is that you think your
toilet is perfectly clean

310
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,500
because it's white.
But is it?

311
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,940
With a revealer you can see

312
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,840
that bleach only whitens
difficult stains like limescale.
