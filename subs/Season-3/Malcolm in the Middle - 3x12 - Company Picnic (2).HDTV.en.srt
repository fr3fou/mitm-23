It's a company picnic! Attended
by my new boss whom I haven't met!

3
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:40,910
I like her. Don't screw this up!

4
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:44,190
Laurie, hi! It's
so good to see you!

5
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:47,350
Keep moving.
Is your new boss here?

6
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:50,590
They're all here! There's
Landon, head of the company.

7
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:53,990
I woke up with the dog...
licking my face.

8
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:58,670
I thought it was my husband!
I better see what my boys are doing.

9
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:04,360
It is a real pleasure to meet you,
Mr Landon! Er, same here!

10
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,550
You're playing girls?! The men won't
play us until we beat the ladies.

11
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:14,590
You're responsible for these.
The coach wants to make a wager.

12
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:19,680
What's up with my skates? The blades
are dull! Somebody unscrewed mine!

13
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:25,310
If you liked someone, would you
tell them? I like you, too.

14
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:28,790
Oh, my God! What? I was
talking about Gary Spindler!

15
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:33,440
You're going to be tied together
for three hours. Let's get hopping.

16

Wow, these are nice woods!

29
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:15,870
Come on, Malcolm,
we're still friends!

30
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:19,870
We can still have fun, right? Why
don't you help me with this clue?

31
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:22,830
"North of the fork
and up a small hill,

32
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:26,470
under a joke without J
is a yellow bill."

33
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:28,550
This doesn't make any sense!

34
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:31,830
You'd think they'd
make sense! Gary Spindler?!

35
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:36,390
Malcolm! What do you see in him?
He high-fives people when they decide

36
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:39,870
what they want on their pizza!
He still says, "It's the bomb!"

37
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:42,910
"Hi, I'm Gary.
I have a laser pointer!"

38
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:46,230
He's nice. Can we concentrate
on the scavenger hunt

39
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:49,390
or we'll fall behind!
It's a yellow duck

40
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:53,910
under that oak tree there.
Joke without J, oke. Oak tree.

41
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:56,550
The fork was back there.

42
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:58,270
(SQUEAKS)

43
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:00,870
Wow, you were right!
That's great, Malcolm!

44
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:05,670
You're good at this! Yes, I am.
I have a lot of other good qualities.

45
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:09,270
There's lots of things to like about
me if I was given half a chance!

46
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:11,790
Can we just do this?
Fine.

47
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:14,710
OK, clue number two.

48

For God's sakes! Gary Spindler?!

51
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,830
What's going on out there?
We've gone back two goals!

52
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:41,510
I can't get speed with
these skates! Get them sharpened!

53
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:45,520
I already had Francis
sharpen them twice! (COUGHS)

54
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:54,600
Besides, number 32 is amazing!
She's a monster!
She's crippled our front line!

55
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,240
(CHUCKLES)

56
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:07,390
Sorry to take you away
from your family, Mr Landon.
About this Mr Lan- I know, Bert.

57
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:11,390
Bert, I need your help! The cubicle
dwellers are getting restless. Ah.

58
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:15,390
Apparently they know about my
reputation for downsizing. I thought

59
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:19,190
you could shoot them a little BS
to calm them down. Actually, I...

60
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:23,310
Great! Hey, everybody! I
know there are some concerns here

61
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:27,590
so I've brought Mr Landon over
to put your minds at ease.

62
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:31,310
Now, he's taking time away from his
family so not too many questions.

63
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:36,670
This is beautiful! Phil, Mr Landon
would like to put our minds at ease!

64
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:39,470
Isn't that right, Bert?

65
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:42,310
Hal?!
Ah, Bert. Albert.

66
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:44,630
Halbert. Hal! You know?

67
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:50,070
I'm sensing a lot of confusion here
but the keyword to keep in mind

68
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:53,150
is loyalty.

69
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:56,470
When you're worried about
your job it's very tempting

70
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:59,550
to make a fellow
co-worker look bad

71
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:04,150
but who really cares if
someone's wife's an alcoholic...

72
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:09,990
..or that someone has an unnatural
attraction to women in suits?

73
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:13,230
The important thing
is we're in this together!

74
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:16,560
And remember,
nobody likes a snitch!

75
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,870
So, let's have a
great picnic, huh?

76
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:22,970

79
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:39,030
I don't see a fork. I saw a broken
spoon! Shut up! I'm trying to think

80
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:43,310
of a joke without a lot of
Js in it! Ohh, I found a cup.

81
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:47,350
You're supposed to look for a fork!
You know, a fork? The little thing

82
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:51,190
with... things! Geez!
You go. I'll stay here.

gonna do is make her feel bad

Hey, look at this! We're doing
great! You're so good at this.

161
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:49,670
Stop! What are
you doing?! I'm sorry!

162
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:53,950
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Just tell me,
what's your big problem with me?

163
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:56,750
Malcolm!
Seriously, I want to know!

164
00:14:56,850 --> 00:15:00,790
Am I too short? Am I too smart?
Malcolm, can we please drop this?

165
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:05,710
I'm smart. Is that a crime? I'm sorry
I'm not a moron like Gary Spindler!

166
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:09,350
Malcolm, stop it!
What are you doing?

167
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:12,950
Tell me why you don't like me.
Why are you doing this?

168
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:16,550
I want an answer!
I can't believe I liked you!

169
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:20,910
You liked me?! I knew it!
I wasn't crazy! You did like me!

170
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:25,030
So what the hell has changed?
Tell me! I defy you to tell me!

171
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:27,270
Nothing! That's the problem!

172
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:31,470
You're still the obsessive whining
know-it-all who doesn't listen!

173
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:33,950
But you did like me!

174
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:38,190
Malcolm, I DON'T like you!
Can you get that through your head?

175
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:43,310
Before I just didn't have a crush
on you. And now I can't stand you!

176
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:47,150
You want me to tell you why I don't
like you? You want me to tell you

177
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:51,670
why I like nice, funny Gary Spindler
and absolutely despise bitter

178
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:56,790
annoying Malcolm? Do you?
Look,... Well, I'm gonna tell you!

179
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:59,030
There is something wrong with you!

180
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:02,190
I don't know how you do it!
You're cute, smart, funny

181
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:04,670
and somehow you managed
to mess that up!

182
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:09,230
Like today. It was an awkward
situation, but it would've passed.

183
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:13,030
But you just kept picking at it
and picking at it until it turned

184
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:17,110
into this big horrible thing!
There is something wrong inside you!

185
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:20,950
There's something rotten at
the core of your personality!

186
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:23,670
You're just off! That's
not even the worst thing!

187
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:27,750
I... want... candy! I
opened my purse to get a Tic Tac

188
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:31,750
and he dropped out of a tree
on my back! I am so sorry!

189
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:35,990
Now you go and you sit down in that
chair and you put your head down!

190
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:39,350
OK. Did you straighten things out
with Pratt?

191
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:43,470
Almost. Oh, for God's sake, Hal!
Where is he? I'll talk to him.

192
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:48,110
No! It's too late now. It would be
awkward. Hal, you work with the man.

193
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:52,350
He'll find out! It'll be two seconds
of embarrassment and then it's over.

194
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:54,560
Now go!

195
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:09,190
Pratt, do you have a moment?
For you, Bert? Of course!

196
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:11,630
You're fired!
What?

197
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:14,190
I don't think
it's working out.

198
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:18,110
I haven't started yet!
What could you be basing this on?

199
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:22,110
My gut. I didn't get this far
without trusting my instincts.

200
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:26,240
I'm sorry, son. I think it's best
if you just leave the picnic now.

201
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:31,680
They have foil
if you wanna wrap that up.

202
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:40,430
(SOBS) I'm so sorry, Malcolm! I just
started talking and I couldn't stop.

203
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:44,350
And I said all those mean things.
I didn't even mean half of them!

204
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:47,590
Who am I to say that
your kids would be screwed up?

205
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:51,390
You might not even
have kids! Are you OK?

206
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:55,110
(SOBS) I think I
can stop crying now.

207
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:59,590
Can you get me more
leaves? Oh, Malcolm!

208
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:02,990
No, really, I'm fine.
No, Malcolm,

209
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:05,560
that's poison oak!

210
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,960
Of course it is!

211
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,670
Take the shot!

212
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:21,720
(CRASHING / WHISTLE)

213
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,470
Ahh, geez, guys! Am I bad?!
How could I have done that?!

214
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:32,470
Ahh, don't beat yourself
up, buddy. We all make mistakes.

215
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:35,800
Shake it off.
You're doing your best.

216
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:41,150
Eric, I'm doing terrible!
Why's everybody being so nice to me?

217
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:45,240
You're doing your best! You're part
of the team. We're in this together.

218
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,030
You boys have all the items
on the list. Plus a wallet,

219
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:56,910
a girl's bracelet and a fork.
Give us the 100 bucks. There you go.

220
00:18:57,010 --> 00:19:00,080
Thanks. How about
we separate you two?

221
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,920
I'll miss you!

222
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,830
Nice(!)

223

Mom, you don't have to
hold on to me. I'll be good!

00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:28,430
OK! Lois! You
don't have to thank me.

225
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:30,470
Let me enjoy the
rest of the picnic.

226
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:34,030
You told my husband I'm
insane and should be committed!

227
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:38,030
I didn't say that! Then how does
letting him video-tape us in bed

228
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:41,950
help our marriage?
What?! I didn't tell...

229
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:47,590
You've gotta stop this! I don't have
time for my own family's problems
