00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,190
Dewey? (SIGHS)
Come on out, honey!

2
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:25,110
How does he know
he's going to the doctor?
I certainly didn't say anything!

3
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:27,590
Dewey?

4
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:29,750
Son?

5
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:31,710
Dewey?

6
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:34,750
Dewey, come on out!

7
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:39,520
We love you, son. Dewey,
come on, we're gonna be late!

8
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,960
Oh, poor little thing.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,150
Go start the car.

10
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,560
# "Boss Of Me" -
They Might Be Giants

11
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,390
Awesome dinner, Mom!

12
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:28,710
Those are the best
fish sticks I've ever had!

13
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:30,870
Seriously, I don't know
how you do it.

14
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:33,590
The microwave. But for
the perfect amount of time.

15
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:36,240
I'd better clear my plate
and start my homework.

16
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,470
I thought he was sick,
but tomorrow he's old enough to get
his learner's permit.

17
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:44,230
He's on his best behaviour
until he passes the test.

18
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:47,710
Can I get anyone a nice cup of
peppermint tea? Helps digestion.

19
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:50,670
Mom and Dad have been looking for
any excuse to ground him,

20
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:53,030
but he hasn't screwed
up once in three weeks!

21
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:54,950
It's actually
getting kinda boring.

22
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:57,600
Aah!

23
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,910
Didn't think so.

24
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:07,470
Remember, Dad, you're picking me up
from school to take me to the DNV.

25
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:09,230
I wouldn't miss it, son.

26
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:11,070
(Dear God, what
are we gonna do?)

27
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:13,310
(What can we do?
He hasn't done anything.)

28
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:15,750
(It's Reese! We
haven't looked hard enough.)

29
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:18,790
We're gonna have to face it,
that kid is gonna be mobile.

30
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:20,910
Reese surrounded by
6,000lbs of steel

31
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:22,990
and 20 gallons
of explosive fuel?!

32
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:25,350
It's like giving a shark
a sub-machine gun!

33
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:27,450
(PHONE RINGS)

34
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,910
Hello?
Hey, Dad. Francis!

35
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:34,950
Hi, how are you? We
haven't heard from you in so long!

36
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:38,950
Yeah. You know how I've always been
impulsive and independent-minded,

37
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:42,310
but basically
just unlucky? What?

38
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:44,670
Well, there's been
a certain incident here

39
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:48,950
and without going into
the blame game, let's just say
there's been some damages.

40
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:51,990
That's why you're calling?
No, you can't do that any more.

41
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:55,230
You're on your own, you've
emancipated yourself, remember?

42
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:59,950
You can't run to your parents for
money at the first sign of trouble!

43
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:03,630
I'm not running to my parents,
I'm calling as one adult to another

44
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:05,670
for an adult... loan.

45
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:09,070
No! You've made whatever mess
you've made and you take care of it!

46
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:10,870
I have been taking care of it!

47
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:14,270
I got Big Red to cut me the lumber
in exchange for fur-lined boots.

48
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:18,390
I got Pete to make the boots,
but only because I promised him
a new set of teeth.

49
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:22,230
As you probably know, teeth don't
come cheap!
And that's where you...

50
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:24,190
(SIGHS)

51
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:28,230
Hey, Dave! You know that digital
camera Bernie got that you like?

52
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:31,910
Yeah? Well, what would you pay
if I could get it for you?

53
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:35,230
You can get Bernie
to give up his camera?

54
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:37,230
Absolutely!

55
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:39,390
I've been waiting for this
my whole life!

56
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:42,110
Once I'm driving,
everything changes.

57
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:48,190
I've got to stay out of trouble for
the next 16 hours and I'm home free!

58
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:51,400
How's that? A little
tighter on this side.

59
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,870
OK, you're all set. Now, remember,
do not untie me until the morning,

60
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:00,590
no matter what I say
or how much I beg. Got it.

61
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:03,070
Uh-oh, I gotta go to
the bathroom. Too bad.

62
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:05,170
Just testing.
Thanks, buddy.

63
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,350
It's weird. Reese suddenly doesn't
seem as irritating as he used to.

64
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:13,600
It's amazing what a driver's licence
can do for a relationship!

65
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:23,470
Hi. Dewey, I am warning you,
if you even touch me,

66
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:28,790
you can forget about me driving you
anywhere for the rest of your life!

67
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:30,960
I have nowhere to go.

68
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,400
(PHONE RINGS)

69
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,720
Hello? Hi, Lois, it's Craig.

70
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:42,670
I can't talk right now, er, I'm on
the other line. Only take a second.

71
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:47,670
I have something to say to you
that I only feel comfortable saying
because we're like family.

72
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:49,510
Your son Malcolm
is a filthy vandal.

73
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:52,590
What?! He threw eggs all over
the front of my new apartment.

74
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:54,470
Him and his wheelchair friend.

75
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:56,390
They wanted some free candy,

76
00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:00,190
I said no, next thing I know,
it's like D Day here.

77
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:03,670
Malcolm, get in here! You'd think
I'd be the last person he'd target

78
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:06,710
after I forgave your family
for burning my old place down,

79
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:09,670
which I'd like to remind you,
I hardly ever mention.

80
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:12,630
Craig, I am so sorry!
Well, boys will be boys.

81
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:15,830
All I want is for him to
come over and clean it up.

82
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:19,470
If he could get me a non-fat latte
along the way, that would be great.

83
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:22,550
Don't worry, he's on his way.
What is the matter with you,

84
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:27,190
throwing eggs at Craig's door?!
What are you talking about?

85
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:30,710
I did it, I did it!
You passed the test? I aced it!

86
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:34,750
You got five wrong! Yeah, but I got
11 right, and that's good enough.

87
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:38,670
If the DNV was running my school,
I'd be, like, a C student!

88
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:40,830
Well, congratulations.

89
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:42,870
Send the cheque
to the driving school?

90
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:46,110
Yes, Reese. You sure you
signed it? It's not gonna bounce?

91
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:49,950
Everything is fine. Just go there
straight after school tomorrow.

92
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,550
You guys are the best!

93
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:55,190
I promise when you're old and crazy,
I'll drive to the home and visit you

94
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:58,110
Maybe go for a drive round
the park. Would you like that?

95
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:00,210
I can't wait(!)

96
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,670
Why are you still here? Get
over to Craig's, start cleaning!

97
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:09,070
I didn't throw
anything at his door, I swear!

98
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:11,910
Why would a grown man lie about
something like that?!

99
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:13,830
I lied because I
needed your help.

100
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:16,630
I finally got
my insurance settlement.

101
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:21,430
This receiver works
at both SRS 5.1 and DTS.

102
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:23,550
Subwoofer for
surround sound,

103
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,830
progressive-scan DVD player.

104
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:30,190
Plays both AIFF and MP34
on either CDs or CDRs.

105
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:32,910
I figured you'd be
comfortable with this.

106
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:37,830
I mean, the guys at the store
couldn't find the graphic equalisers
with two hands and a flashlight.

107
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:43,510
You got me here to hook up your
stereo? Can't you get one of your
friends to help you?

108
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:46,160
And tick off the
other friends I didn't ask?

109
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:51,310
Malcolm, this goes
far beyond just a stereo.

110
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:57,430
This is going to be the greatest
entertainment centre ever.

111
00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:00,150
Have you ever wanted to
be the best at something?

112
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,990
Not just good, I
don't mean great,

113
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,990
I mean the absolute best?

114
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:07,510
I don't know.
Well, I have.

115
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:10,070
Ever since I was a kid
watching Land of the Lost

116
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:12,590
on my tiny black
and white six inch.

117
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:17,550
I knew there'd be a day, a day when
I could create my high-def universe.

118
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:22,270
A magical realm where fantasy
and technology intersect
on my every whim

119
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:25,390
because I'm the King.

120
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:29,550
So your lifelong dream was to become
the world's best TV watcher?

121
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:32,800
Yeah. I'm in!

122
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:39,030
I still can't believe it! For
the first time ever, I'm gonna be...

123
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:41,710
..behind the wheel!

124
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:43,790
(He keeps doing that.)

125
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:46,630
I have to go to
Craig's after school.

126
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:50,230
You still have more to clean up?
Yeah. I made a hell of a mess.

127
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:54,760
Hey, Dewey, I want you to know
there's no hard feelings
about the last couple of weeks.

128
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,880
(Because you're gonna suffer
every day for the next ten years.)

129
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,440
Yeah, they're brand new.
The college boy got 'em for me.

130
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,990
This is awesome!
Willy's grandson will love this!

131
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:21,790
Remember, you gotta get that sled
team out to Camp Three before dark.

132
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:26,830
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
You've driven dogs before, right?

133
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:29,320
What do I look
like? Stop worrying!

134
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,830
Neil, you know how to drive
a dog team? Yeah.

135
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:35,350
Do you still have a
crush on Joe's sister?

136
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:38,710
Yeah, but Joe won't let me
date her just cos I'm Irish...

137
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:41,430
..and I got a
bounty on my head.

138
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:43,530
Lemme see what I can do.

139
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,390
Sorry!

140
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:56,440
Sorry!

141
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,150
Sorry!

142
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,840
Ooo, sorry! I'm sorry!

143
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,750
Ooo, sorry! Damn it!

144
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:13,310
I thought I paid
this gas bill already!

145
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:16,790
You're doin' great. Turn right,
you're ready for street drivin'.

146
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:20,270
What?! Jackie's been driving for
half an hour! Her turn is over!

147
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:23,510
It's only been 10 minutes, Reese!
I've been timing you!

148
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:25,670
You've been driving
exactly 27 minutes.

149
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:29,950
You're gonna use up my turn!
When did you learn to tell time?

150
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:34,510
It's digital. I can't believe
I have to be in the same car
as a low life like you!

151
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:37,310
Oh, I'm a low life?
You spend everyday at lunch

152
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,830
sucking on a straw
that's been under my armpit!

153
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:42,630
You pig! That's
it, I've had it!

154
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:45,030
I don't even know
what text messaging is,

155
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:48,080
how can they charge me
15 bucks a month for it?

156
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,350
Malcolm?

157
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:54,830
Don't connect those cables,
their impedance values aren't equal!

158
00:09:54,930 --> 00:10:00,150
You'll get a reflected transmission.
That's what the scan modulation
is for!

159
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:03,310
Trust me, 480P is more
than enough to take care of it.

160
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:06,310
Then I can't use the analogue
pre-amp to play my SACDs.

161
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:08,590
You're tired,
you're not thinking right!

162
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:12,670
I'm using single-ended interconnects
for the front left-right speakers!

163
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:16,670
Are you mad? You can't
do that! Just watch me.

164
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:21,790
I know it sounds weird, but this is
the most fulfilling conversation
I've had in weeks.

165
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:25,190
Shouldn't there be a signal to tell
these cars to get out of the way?

166
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:27,710
Does anyone see a
thingy of stamps by their feet?

167
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:32,400
It's been 45 minutes! I'm not gonna
get my turn! OK, pull over.

168
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:39,150
Finally! I just need
to go to the post office.

169
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:42,080
Oh, God, look
at that line.

170
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,630
What are you doing? It's my turn!

171
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:48,470
Oh, sorry, doesn't look like
we'll have enough time.

172
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:53,040
But you got very valuable...
watching experience.
We'll get to you next week.

173
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,150
Slide over. No way!

174
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,250
(BELCHES) Ugh!

175
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,990
I at least get to drive
back to the stupid school.

176
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:10,350
I'm not going home without at least
touching the steering wheel.

177
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:12,350
(SMASH!) What was that?!

178
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:16,110
You crashed! No, I didn't.
The car's not even in drive!

179
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:18,110
Yeah, well, you're behind the wheel,

180
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:22,310
what are you gonna
do now, hotshot? Ah!

181
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:27,280
I'm so sorry, I...
Aaarrrggghhh!

182
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,620
You're two
clicks away

183
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,720
from the new shape
of lip colour.

184
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,480
Infallible colour
lasts up to 16 hours,

185
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,580
even after
eating.

186
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,920
The conditioning balm
helps lock in moisture.

187
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:06,980
Brilliant!

188
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,020
In ten radiant shades.

189
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,940
Colour that's made
to stay on your lips...

190
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,040
And only on your lips.

191
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:13,980
Infallible?

192
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,080
It's my lip colour.

193
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,300
The lip duo
compact

194
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,180
that lasts
up to 16 hours.

195
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,180

00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,380
new Cillit Bang Multi Power.

199
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,860
It was so quick and easy.

200
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,780
Look how it cleans this toothpaste

201
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,500
and my make-up
stains. What a shine!

202
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,860
And a new fresh smell.

203
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,700
For taps clogged
with limescale...

204
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,220
Look, it's amazing.

205
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,900
Clean as a whistle.

206
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,180
It also works
in the kitchen

207
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,860
and gets rid of cooking spills

208
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,380
with so little effort.

209
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,300
For great results

210
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,420

00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,300
Try it now!

212

Cillit Bang Grime & Lime
Multi Power.

213
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,780
And no more tedious scrubbing

214
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,460
with Cillit Bang Grease & Floor.

215
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,900
The new
all-purpose cleaner

216
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
that gives great results
on large surfaces

217
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,140
and even
when used neat.

218
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,240
Cillit Bang
Grease & Floor.

219
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:11,080
There comes a time when
a dog's joints get a bit...

220
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,920
you know, not
what they were.

221
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,520
But with new
Pedigree Joint Care +,

222
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,640
you could see a
real difference.

223
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,600
One treat a day
for just six weeks,

224
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:27,760
and you'll soon see why
you can't keep a good dog down.

225
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,550
So, let's see,

226
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:41,830
you've got grand theft auto,
malicious crashing and what else?

227
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:44,230
Oh, yeah, kidnapping me!

228
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:47,430
I knew you'd go to prison,
I just figured it'd be after prom.

229
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:49,430
Shut up and let
me think about this!

230
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:51,910
Do you realise you are
driving 20mph on a freeway?

231
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:54,990
I am not getting a speeding ticket
on top of everything else!

232
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:57,830
Will you just leave me alone
and let me figure this out?

233

(SIRENS WAIL)

234
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,110
Ha!

235
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:08,270
OK, don't panic, it's
just a cop, that's nothing.

236
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:10,960
You can handle
one stupid cop.

237
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,310
Oh, man!

238
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:17,910
What are you doing?
Aren't you pulling over?

239
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:20,350
I don't know.
I think I'm still going.

240
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:24,830
If you're being chased by the cops
and they say pull over, you have to.
That's the law!

241
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:27,360
Yeah, well, even
so... You can't!

You know, that's a
really good plan, Reese.

243
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:34,750
There's just one
little problem with it.

244
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:36,880
This is a driver's ed car!

245
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,750
Oh! Those cheap sons of...!

about Francis! I haven't seen him!

247
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:48,910
I spent hours digging post holes
cos he promised me a satellite dish!

248
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:51,310
He promised me
a satellite dish!

249
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:54,710
Where the hell's
my George Foreman grill?

250
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:56,470
I'm just as mad
as the rest of you.

251
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:59,430
I'm pretty sure these
teeth came off a dead guy.

cousin is in a heap of trouble.

Oui.

Another half turn. Easy!

257
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:20,590
Easy, don't strip it.

258
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:22,950
Got it! Beautiful!

259
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:27,510
Now all we have
to do is adjust it.

260
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:31,550
Congratulations! It was pretty hairy,
especially with the hub connectors.

261
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:34,270
Stripping quarter inch
off the leads was inspiring.

262
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:37,040
I hardly remember it.
I was running on adrenaline!

263
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:41,590
You know, Craig, I gotta tell you,
this was a lot of fun.

264
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:43,910
I actually enjoyed
spending time with you.

265
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:47,590
You didn't have to lie
to get me over here. Yes, I did.

266
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:50,550
Yeah, OK, but
you wouldn't now.

267
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:53,030
I guess what I'm
trying to say is,

268
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:57,200
you know,... I'm sorry for
all the times we made you miserable.

269
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,030
It's OK. You're a good guy.

270

OK.

screw it up,... buddy.

00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:53,750
Just get him on the phone
and let me handle this.

303
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:57,110
I'm the only one who knows how.
Trust me, we have it under control.

304
00:19:57,210 --> 00:19:59,550
Don't think I don't know
what's gonna happen!

305
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:03,790
You're gonna do your standard police
thing and my son is gonna get shot!

306
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:06,480
Ma'am, that almost never happens.

307
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:11,510
Just get him on the phone!

308
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:15,390
Tell him if he wants to see daylight
again, he'll pull over this instant!

309
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:18,790
"Your mother wants you to know
that she loves you and..."

310
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:21,550
He has 10 seconds to pull over
that car or I will...!

311
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:24,470
"Give you lots of
hugs and kisses."

312
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:29,390
You heard your mom, you're not
in trouble. Can you pull over now?

313
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:31,760
That's not my mom.

314
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,150
Please, dear God, I know I haven't
been a saint, but I swear, if you...

315
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:45,760
Ah! Aaaarrrggghhh!

316
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,840
No, Daddy, this is not my fault,
I'm just a passenger.

317
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:57,470
How is this making you look like
a chump? I'm the one...

318
00:20:57,570 --> 00:20:59,270
Hold on.

319
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:02,470
Hello? No! No,
I'm on the other line.

320
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:05,190
If you wanna talk to him,
use the bullhorn thingy!

321
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:07,290
Hi, I'm back.

322
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,190
No, I was not
talking to Mom, it was the...

323
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:13,150
Daddy, I don't
care who she's...

324
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:14,870
No, I will not tell her!

325
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:16,970
You have to stop
putting me in...

326
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:22,390
Go ahead. Go ahead, cancel
the card, cancel all my cards!

327
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:26,280
I'm gonna be in this car
for the rest of my life, anyway.

328
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,670
OK, I've got an idea.

329
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:32,470
What? There's a railroad
crossing about a mile ahead.

330
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:35,470
If we jump out a second before
the train squashes the car,

331
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:37,590
we can start new lives
as circus people.

332
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:40,270
Reese, come on,
this is getting scary.

333
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:42,370
What are you gonna do?

334
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,510
"This is your
last warning."

335
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:49,440
"Pull over or you will
be forced from the road."

336
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,390
Jackie, I have to
tell you something.

337
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:55,710
Just because I hate you
doesn't mean I'm not sorry.

338
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:58,230
What? I didn't mean
to get you into this!

339
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:01,310
It's just that I'm not...
You know, I'm not very smart.

340
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:05,190
So when I get in trouble, I panic,
then I do things that make it worse.

341
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:08,320
I'm really sorry.
And your dad is a tool.

342
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,950
Hey, I was just kidding about
the kidnapping thing.

343
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:16,760
You have enough to worry about
without me being a jerk about it.

344
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,430
Wait a second!
Jackie, gimme your phone!

345
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:24,110
I have a brother who's a total
genius, he'll know what to do.

346
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:27,630
How many police cars are behind you?
I don't know, eight, maybe nine.

347
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:31,510
What are we gonna do?
There's no way out!

348
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:35,320
Sometimes things look their darkest
right before the sun breaks through.

349
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,390
And sometimes
you just have to realise

350
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:48,800
that the game is over
and that you've lost. The...

351
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,230
The only left thing to do
is to stop running,

352
00:22:57,330 --> 00:23:00,680
stand up and face the
consequences like a man. And...

353
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:09,870
And even if the outcome is more
horrible than you could've imagined,

354
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:12,750
you can hold your head
up high, show some class

355
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:16,600
and end it with dignity.

356
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:24,280
Class? "For the
love of God, stop! Argh!"

357
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,520
Where is he going? He's turning.

358
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,560
# "In Too Deep" - Sum 41

359
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,240
Wow! Nice! ..It was!

360
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:16,200
OK, that's impressive.
Look, he's pulling over!

361
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,670
I think he's gonna
parallel park! No way!

362
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:28,160
The spot is way too small! He hasn't
given himself enough space!

363
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,270
He did it! Now just get out of
the damn car, please!

364
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:39,680
Reese, that was amazing!

365
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:44,790
Listen, when the kids at school
ask you about this,...

366
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:47,800
..tell them I
got under your bra.

367
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,400
I'll call the lawyer
and have him meet us there.

368
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:08,110
Give 'em a reason,
give 'em a reason!

369
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:10,150
"The suspect appears to be
resisting."

370
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:13,960
"Oh, looks like they're taking out
the pepper spray." "Argh! Argh!"

371
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,990
Why do we have to have to dress
like this? It's his hearing!

372
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:24,990
I want the judge to see that Reese
comes from a respectable family
that loves him very much!

373
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:29,670
Why aren't they trying him
as an adult? Come on, we gotta go!

374
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:33,750
I have to go to Craig's.
He's getting his cast off
and wants me to videotape it.

375
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:35,870
Craig's talking already?
Good for him!

376
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:39,310
I was really creeped out by that
one blink yes, two blinks no stuff.

377
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:42,480
No, you got it the other
way around. One blink means no.

378
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,520
So the soup was too hot!
