1
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,680
What are you doing? We've started
showering in gym class.

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,270
# Yes, no

3
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:18,370
# Maybe

4
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,750
# I don't know

5
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:23,990
# Can you repeat the question

6
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:26,070
# You're not the boss of me now

7
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:28,470
# You're not the boss of me now

8
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,790
# You're not the boss of me now

9
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:32,750
# And you're not so big

10
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:35,150
# You're not the boss of me now

11
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,110
# You're not the boss of me now

12
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:39,110
# You're not the boss of me now

13
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:41,400
# And you're not so big

14
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,840
# Life is unfair #

15
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,830
(BELCHES) Could you pass
the peas, please? (ALL LAUGH)

16
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:58,190
(BELCHES) Thank you.
(ALL LAUGH)

17
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:01,910
(BELCHES) You're welcome.
(ALL LAUGH) Hal?

18
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:05,640
(BELCHES) Alright, boys.
That's enough. (ALL LAUGH)

19
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,750
(FARTS)
(ALL LAUGH)

20
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:17,310
For once could we have
a civilised conversation
during dinner free of sound effects?

21
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:21,360
It's not asking too much for us to
have some nice dinner conversation.

22
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,830
Malcolm, how was school?
History class was cool.

23
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:33,910
Tell us about it. Jimmy Perkins
kicked the crap out of Fred Nason.

24
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:37,630
He beat up Fred Nason? He's huge!
Fred knocked Jimmy's hat off

25
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:41,630
and Jimmy punched him in the face
five times in a row in a second!

26
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:45,670
Fred fell and he started
hitting him. It was way cool!

27
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:51,150
Jimmy Perkins is crazy. I told you,
crazy beats big every time.

28
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:52,110
(FARTS)

29
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:55,240
(ALL LAUGH HYSTERICALLY)

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,070
So, how was your day, dear?

31
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:13,030
Hey, how's Alaska? Where are you?
You were meant to be here already!

32
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:17,030
No-one will pick me up, I ran out
of money and had to work for a week.

33
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:20,630
There's a serial killer loose
in Idaho who looks just like me.

34
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:23,790
I don't know how much longer they'll
hold the job. "I'm almost there!"

35
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:26,310
Do I take the
provincial highway 99

36
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:30,430
or the 27 to provincial highway 12?
What?! I'm near to British Columbia.

37
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:34,430
I'm in Bellingham, Washington.
Francis, you're 2,000 miles away!

38
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:38,950
What?! No way! I've just exchanged
all my money for Alaskan dollars!

39
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:43,400
There's no such thing
as Alaskan dollars! Sir!

40
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,150
Are you almost finished with that?
What have you got in mind?

41
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:55,390
Will you watch the boys next Tuesday
night? I've joined a book club.

42
00:02:55,490 --> 00:03:01,510
You don't wanna do that. I joined
a record club. They hounded me for
years. It's not that sort of club.

43
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:05,230
This is women from school.
Adults discussing books.

44
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:09,190
Oh. I live in a house filled
with boys. I listen to boy talk

45
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:13,110
and boy noises. I need
to spend some time with females.

46
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:17,550
Mmm-hmm. When I see them they invite
me to do things and I never go.

47
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:22,270
Yeah? I need to do
this for my sanity.

48
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:27,350
Yeah. (CHUCKLES) Yes! Yes.
Are you even listening to me?

49
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:30,030
Of course I am.
Here's what I think.

50
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:34,030
It's a great idea. It's about time
you did something like this.

51
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:38,030
You have a brilliant and beautiful
mind that needs challenging.

52
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:40,840
I hope those women
can keep up with you.

53
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,560
Make a wish.

54
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,910
I left the phone number on the
counter. The dishes are in the sink.

55
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:55,910
The batteries from the remote are in
the smoke alarm. Just for tonight!

56
00:03:56,010 --> 00:04:00,030
Will you relax, honey? You're off
the clock! This is your night out!

57
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:04,190
Just enjoy yourself, huh? Yeah, Mom.
Stop worrying. Have fun.

58
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:09,360
Take the garbage cans
to the kerb tonight.
Stop worrying! Go have some fun!

59
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,470
Now? No, let's let Mom
get a few blocks away.

60
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:19,190
Right. This could be a trick.
What are you talking about?

61
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:23,870
We've got fireworks buried outside.
We'll dig them up while Mom's gone.

62
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:29,550
Tracy Hines is having a party.
We're not invited.
Our justice will be swift but fair.

63
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:33,310
We'll be fine! 'I
don't want to screw this up.'

64
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:37,110
'Lois needs time to herself.
She deserves a night out.'

65
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,910
'She'll have fun
and will come home happy.'

66
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:43,910
'I just have to keep the boys under
control. What am I talking about?'

67
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:47,990
'They're good kids. What am
I talking about? They're monsters!'

68
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:51,990
'They'll destroy everything and then
ruin Lois's night! Then she'll feel

69
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:56,110
like we can't be trusted on our own!
She'll never want a night out again

70
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:58,600
and it will all be my fault!'

71
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,510
We're going out back.
You're not going anywhere!

72
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:08,880
Stay in your room all night
with the door shut! Now go! Go!

73
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:15,190
Hmmm! This cheddar is
wonderful! It is good.

74
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:18,550
So, I really liked the book!
Really?

75
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:21,400
Oh, Karen, let's
have some more wine!

76
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:28,030
The voice of the narrator was
shifted from character to character.

77
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:32,510
Oh, I'll just have to take your word
on that. I didn't read the book.

78
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:36,200
Oh, was anyone else confused
by those flashbacks?

79
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,670
Am I the only one
who read the book?

80
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:47,350
Actually, Lois, we don't make it
mandatory to read the book.

81
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:50,190
What? I mean,
we're all busy.

82
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:55,350
That shouldn't prevent us
from enjoying a relaxing evening
once in a while.

83
00:05:55,450 --> 00:06:00,750
Lois, don't you feel you deserve
one night away from the bickering,

84
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:06,310
the yelling and the TV blaring? Away
from all the stupid little problems

85
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:10,920
that can't seem to
be solved without you?

86
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,760
A little more.

87
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:30,150
Thank you! Thank you for stopping!
I'm glad to. The name's Roy.

88
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:34,950
Francis. It's freezing! I've been
standing there for six hours!

89
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:40,830
People were flipping me off as they
drove by. Why would they do that?

90
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:43,910
How far are you going?
Mamu.

91
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:48,030
I'm going to Green River. I can take
you almost the whole way. Really?

92
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:52,990
It's taken me the last 3 days
to get 20 miles! Thank you.

93
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:58,270
You OK? Yeah, it's just...
people aren't very nice!

94
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:02,040
You want some coffee?
(SOBS) Yes!

95
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:08,430
My Mom and I were screaming
at each other. She's finding time

96
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:12,430
to tell the cab driver which route
to take! She's a control freak!

97
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:16,430
She sounds like she's afraid. What
would my mom have to be afraid of?

98
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:21,030
If she doesn't control every aspect
of her life or the lives of the ones

99
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:25,630
she cares about that horrible things
will happen. What horrible things?

100
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:29,910
Her oldest son moving
5,000 miles away from her.

101
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:33,630
Alright, you got me there.
You're pretty smart.

102
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:37,630
I'm on the road 18 hours a day.
Gives me a lot of time to think

103
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:41,270
about things, people,
why they do the things they do.

104
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:44,670
I'm a wannabe psychiatrist.
I'm glad to be out.

105
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:48,670
I've got a line that I won't cross.
If anybody tries to push me

106
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:51,710
across it, I'm gone.
Everybody's got a line.

107
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:56,550
But what's interesting is everyone's
line is different. It moves.

108
00:07:56,650 --> 00:08:00,990
Look at your situation here. It is
freezing cold, there's no other cars

109
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:05,430
on the road... Hypothetically,
if I said put on a curly red wig

110
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:10,030
or I'll throw you out, are you
gonna go back out into the cold?

111
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:13,560
That's ridiculous! You
can't use a silly example...

112
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,200
You're kidding?

113
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,440
OK!

114
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:30,150
You haven't made a sound in half
an hour! What's going on in here?

115
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:33,430
Nothing. I expect
perfect behaviour tonight.

116
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:35,750
If you try anything,

117
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:39,720
ANYTHING AT ALL, I will be on you
like a rainbow on an oil slick!

118
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:50,430
'Good. You sent them a message.
Fired the shot across their bow.'

119
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,030
'Now they know
who's in charge!'

120
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:57,750
Maybe I was too harsh. If the boys
push back they might do something

121
00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:01,710
ten times worse and spoil everything
for Lois! 'Don't go soft!'

122
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:05,640
'All these boys understand
is the iron fist!'

123
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:11,070
No, I need to
get them on my side!

124
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:15,510
Dewey, be lookout while we dig up the
fireworks. What's going on with Dad?

125
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:18,430
Maybe he's dealing with
something at work.

126
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:22,230
I hope he'll be OK. At his age
carrying around that tension

127
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:27,720
can't be good for you. Oh!
Dad's here! Who wants ice cream?

128
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:54,470
I come home after work after
a ten-hour shift and I see my boys

129
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:59,270
and they're covered with grass
and paint and all they can say is,

130
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:02,870
"Where's dinner?"
(ALL MURMUR IN AGREEMENT)

131
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:07,430
Too much is expected of us.
Our society is just so screwed up.

132
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:11,950
30 years ago you could just at least
pick something and go with it.

133
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:18,070
A housewife, a career woman, sex
slave. But now you're supposed to
do everything and it's impossible!

134
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:21,350
Unless you're
Lillian Miller. (ALL) Yeah!

135
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:25,430
If it weren't for me my family would
be living in trees, eating berries.

136
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:28,950
Do they appreciate what I do
for them? Nooooo!

137
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:33,350
Lillian's family surprised her
with a trip to Spain! No kidding!

138
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:37,510
I discovered a two-inch-long hair
growing out of my shoulder. How long

139
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:44,070
has it been there? I don't have time
to put myself right in the morning.

140
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:49,830
Lillian Miller brought 20 home-made
cakes to the school-bake sale.

141
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:52,310
I had those!

142
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:54,830
They were delicious!

143
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:59,550
The woman just cooks like a god
but she never puts on a pound!

144
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:03,230
You can't be 45
and still be a size 2!

145
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:06,600
Those are sizes for
children! And Lillian!

146
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:13,230
Ladies, I just realised something.
Society isn't making us miserable.

147
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:17,110
Hell, we're society!
(ALL CHEER IN AGREEMENT)

148
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:21,310
No, no! Every single one
of our problems can be traced back

149
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:26,750
to that tight-assed overachieving
marathon-running master chef...

150
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:29,640
..Lillian Miller!

151
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,070
# Mademoiselle from
Armentieres, Parlez-vous

152
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:37,870
# Mademoiselle from
Armentieres, Parlez-vous

153
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:39,630
# She got the palm
and the croix de guerre

154
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,310
# For washing
soldiers' underwear

155
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:43,790
# Inky dinky,
parlez-vous... #

156
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:47,990
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! What?
It's hinky dinky parlez-vous.

157
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:51,990
That's what I said. You said inky
dinky. You've got to start over.

158
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:55,680
I'm not starting over. It's
freezing! I can barely feel my lips!

159
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:01,990
# Mademoiselle from
Armentieres, Parlez-vous

160
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:05,160
Parlez-... #

161
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:10,790
Thanks for the ice-cream, Dad.
You're welcome, Dewey. Don't worry

162
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:15,120
about this mess. I'll take care
of it. Just sit there and relax.

163
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,270
Alright, what the
hell is going on?

164
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:24,350
I think he's feeling guilty about
something. Maybe we can exploit it!

165
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:28,110
How? Send Dewey in there crying
about the train Mom put in the attic.

166
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:30,910
Mom didn't put a
train in the attic. Exactly!

167
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:34,270
When he's up there,
we can dig up the fireworks.

168
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:38,230
Dewey, we need you to cry. It's
gotta be the right kind of crying.

169
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:43,640
Not sobbing, more of a penetrating
whining sound. Give me a moment.

170
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,630
OK, that was a good idea.
They're happy.

171
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:51,630
I've got them motivated to behave
themselves and Lois is gonna see

172
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:55,670
that I can handle them without her.
'Are you kidding? You've gone soft!'

173
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:59,670
'You've totally lost their respect.
Lois isn't gonna like this!'

174
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:02,270
Come on! They're under control.

175
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:08,040
'What if they aren't? What if
they're pretending to behave
so they can set you up?' (CRASHING)

176
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:13,270
Occupy them. Keep them busy so they
don't have time to get in trouble.

177
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:17,870
How am I gonna keep them busy?
You better find a way. (CRYING) >

178
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:21,990
Dad, Dewey really wants you - Boys!
Let's spend a little time together.

179
00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:25,190
We can... I know!
We can do some callisthenics!

180
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:29,750
What?! You boys love to exercise!
But I just ate a ton of ice cream.

181
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:32,790
You are starting
to get a little flabby.

182
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:36,150
(CHUCKLES)
I'm too full.

183
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:40,270
When you start moving you'll feel
better! Let's go! One. Two.

184
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:42,640
One. Two. One.
Two. One. Two.

185
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:49,350
Stupid! Stupid!
It was a terrible idea!

186
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:53,230
It was a great idea!
A great idea poorly executed.

187
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:56,110
Terrible idea.
Terrible execution.

188
00:17:56,210 --> 00:18:00,320
Why don't you just lock them in
the bathroom until Lois gets home?

189
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:08,480
Look at that house. It's perfect!

190
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:13,910
No, no, no! We didn't come here
for a mindless vandalism.

191
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:16,470
We came to screw up her car!

192
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:21,230
See how she feels when she's late
for car pool like a real person!

193
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:25,280
She probably won't even be able
to get out of bed on a morning!

194
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:30,430
This time next year she's
gonna be living in a trailer

195
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:34,350
with little ceramic donkey in the
front yard. (ALL GIGGLE DRUNKENLY)

Shhh! Shhh!

197
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,110
Whoopsy! Whoops!

198
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:42,560
Will you shhh?!

199
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:49,070
She's wearing pearls
to make cookies?! (Doilies!)

200
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:51,870
(What kind of a monster
is this woman?)

201
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:55,710
Oh, God! Those cookies smell good!
Let's kill her and eat them!

202
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:59,760
(Karen,... why
don't you go stand guard?)

00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:23,390
Oh, one of us should probably
know something about cars.

206
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:27,390
It doesn't matter! Just pull some
of the wires! Let's get out of here!

Karen! You've gotta settle down!

209
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:42,870
Whoa! Whoa!
Karen, why don't you see if you
can say the alphabet backward?

210
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:45,910
Z, y, x, w, v,
u, t, s, r, q,

212

Hey! Lillian's gone!
What do you mean, gone?

216
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,950
It's a pointless exercise!
You haven't proven a thing.

217
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:34,790
You haven't determined what my
limits are. This hasn't bothered me

218
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:38,440
and if you think it has,
the joke is on you! Clench.

That's the third time he drove down
that alley! He knows we're in here!

221

This is gross! I can't believe
I'm wearing open-toed shoes.

222
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:58,510
(SOBS) I can't believe I'm hiding
from the cops in a dumpster!

223
00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:01,200
I just wanted to
talk about books.

224
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:05,950
Oh, and it was
such a good book, too!

225
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:10,270
The first shadowing was effective
without being heavy-handed.

226
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:14,390
The characters were flawed
but compelling and the entire story

227
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:19,990
was brimming with insight
into the character's condition!

228
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:24,790
But how did you find time to read
it? Your family sounds so horrible!

229
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:27,190
I was lying!

230
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:31,750
I made all that stuff up
so that I would fit in!

231

They're wonderful!
I mean, they're idiots!

232
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:39,230
But at least they try. I wanted
it to be the happiest night!

233
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:42,520
Look what I did with it!

234
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:50,270
What are you doing? You'll see.
Go home to your family and hug them
for me. They sound wonderful!

Why is he making us watch this
about salt?

241

Would you rather be locked in the
bathroom? Or chased by the monster?

242
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:28,270
Do something! I'm trying! Every time
we make a move he's ahead of us.

243
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:32,310
He's impossible to predict! With Mom
you get a little consistency.

00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,550
I am going to take a bath.

00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:31,630
I'm asking you boys
one last time to behave.

00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:34,110
Not for me but
for your mother.

After all she does for you
one night of peace

257
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:40,190
shouldn't be too
much to ask for.

258
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:43,760
So if you love her,
you will do this for her.

259
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:57,750
Wow, I've never had anyone empty
the box before! I'm outta props!

260
00:23:57,850 --> 00:24:01,950
I was bored with your experiment at
first but I admit, I learned a lot

261
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:06,750
about myself. Who am I to judge
people for the choices they make?

262
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:10,750
From now on I'm gonna be a bit more
understanding and a lot more humble.

00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:14,590
Wanna stop for some dinner?

Sure! Why not like this?

a book? I'm sure - Hey, Merna!

get for being rude.

270

We'll hide these in the closet,
then we'll cover up the hole

271
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:51,600
and by the time Mom's home,
we'll be sleeping. Boys! FIREWORKS?!

I hope your friends are
doing all sorts of fun stuff
