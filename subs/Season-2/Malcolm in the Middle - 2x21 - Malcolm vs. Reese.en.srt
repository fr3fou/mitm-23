1
00:00:32,618 -> 00:00:35,213
Hi Mom Want a worm?

2
00:00:36,028 -> 00:00:37,745
For the love of god

3
00:00:39,530 -> 00:00:41,185
Well you have to let you clean

4
00:00:42,759 -> 00:00:44,665
And do not forget the ears Dewey

5
00:00:45,479 -> 00:00:47,154
Okey

6
00:01:28,294 -> 00:01:30,989
When everything is at home Fracis
what we do is fun

7
00:01:31,271 -> 00:01:35,210
I mean we only see a stupid program
TV but no matter how absolutely brilliant.

8
00:01:35,568 -> 00:01:38,914
Totally sucks,
Is not there anything fun to do here?

9
00:01:39,927 -> 00:01:42,990
I have chalk silhouettes can draw
of corpses on the sidewalk

10
00:01:43,522 -> 00:01:44,208
Boring

11
00:01:45,230 -> 00:01:47,524
Mom is at home we can play watermelon-ball

12
00:01:47,524 -> 00:01:48,992
We did the last time I was home

13
00:01:49,741 -> 00:01:50,866
Come on guys think!

14
00:01:54,532 -> 00:01:56,362
I bow at the silhouettes

15
00:02:01,296 -> 00:02:05,549
My kitten has ear infection,
needs eye drops three times daily

16
00:02:06,049 -> 00:02:09,774
A malbabisco like half a can of
wet food on a plate

17
00:02:10,235 -> 00:02:12,203
And half a can of dry on the other

18
00:02:12,786 -> 00:02:16,709
And he likes the juice from the wet on dry food

19
00:02:17,007 -> 00:02:19,613
And not too much, I mean it sir.

20
00:02:20,411 -> 00:02:22,882
Okay, maybe tomorrow
I can not say no to you

21
00:02:23,359 -> 00:02:26,203
We hurry, you gave us
the numbers of emergency ...

22
00:02:26,203 -> 00:02:28,445
... Of malvabisco, their sweaters and how to take your temperature ...

23
00:02:28,445 -> 00:02:29,814
Anything else you need to know Dewey?

24
00:02:31,196 -> 00:02:35,360
I think that is all champion!
Caring for another living thing is a big responsibility

25
00:02:35,844 -> 00:02:37,133
Are you ready for this challenge?

26
00:02:39,069 -> 00:02:42,065
Greg neglect I have a hunch that
Dewey do a great job.

27
00:02:43,923 -> 00:02:48,629
Great! And when the weekend ends
you win 5 dollars!

28
00:02:49,064 -> 00:02:49,937
I told my mom 10!

29
00:02:50,281 -> 00:02:52,836
Sure, you're very attentive 10 ..

30
00:02:53,235 -> 00:02:55,140
I'm not quite convinced that Hal

31
00:02:56,125 -> 00:02:57,641
Are you sure that Dewey can with this?

32
00:02:57,891 -> 00:03:00,375
Ah, love is no big deal ..
work is a good thing for a child

33
00:03:00,787 -> 00:03:03,344
It teaches the value of money
gives you confidence.

34
00:03:03,843 -> 00:03:06,186
And Greg lives only 2 blocks from the house

35
00:03:06,627 -> 00:03:08,237
Hey, from here you see our garden.

36
00:03:08,836 -> 00:03:11,423
Hey, almost forgot to show you my itinerary

37
00:03:12,244 -> 00:03:16,053
Yes, the convention lasts 3 days
Again on Monday afternoon

38
00:03:17,204 -> 00:03:19,459
Go Greg, I had no idea you liked
both stories

39
00:03:19,722 -> 00:03:22,862
Well I'm not an alienating and
Matenga life in perspective

40
00:03:23,397 -> 00:03:26,912
My problems are insignificant if
compare with those of Richie Rich

41
00:03:27,875 -> 00:03:30,363
Well, it's time to say goodbye to malbavisquito

42
00:03:31,084 -> 00:03:33,313
Give daddy a kiss, give a kiss

43
00:03:39,315 -> 00:03:41,265
I know son, but work is work

44
00:03:45,470 -> 00:03:49,239
Good news guys.
Things are going to get interesting around here.

45
00:03:49,597 -> 00:03:50,219
What?

46
00:03:50,468 -> 00:03:53,802
I forgot you like
the struggle is not it?

47
00:03:54,064 -> 00:03:54,993
The rage in the cage

48
00:03:55,251 -> 00:03:57,722
Oh my god, you're the best brothers
we gonna have fun ..

49
00:03:59,035 -> 00:03:59,928
These are just two tickets

50
00:04:00,315 -> 00:04:04,187
I know! And how I
decide which you wear?

51
00:04:04,750 -> 00:04:07,866
You bought two tickets on purpose
just to torment?

52
00:04:07,866 -> 00:04:09,283
No, of course not.

53
00:04:09,972 -> 00:04:11,804
I bought them to see who loves me more.

54
00:04:12,953 -> 00:04:14,869
Well, I know we both want ...

55
00:04:15,349 -> 00:04:18,687
But .. I bet that some want a little more.

56
00:04:19,001 -> 00:04:21,939
No, do not forget it the
ass kissing competition

57
00:04:22,283 -> 00:04:23,253
There must be another way

58
00:04:23,499 -> 00:04:26,347
Okay, okay.
Want to give me a coin

59
00:04:26,624 -> 00:04:27,054
Well

60
00:04:27,054 -> 00:04:28,367
Go to the front

61
00:04:28,609 -> 00:04:29,721
You should make me a sandwich

62
00:04:31,266 -> 00:04:33,657
Please guys, is the rage in the cage

63
00:04:33,896 -> 00:04:34,670
Should be happy

64
00:04:35,423 -> 00:04:36,563
We are happy

65
00:04:37,314 -> 00:04:38,907
Are not doing the happy dance

66
00:04:43,047 -> 00:04:46,500
Happy dance, happy dance ... we love doing the happy dance.

67
00:04:47,458 -> 00:04:48,250
Happier

68
00:04:48,865 -> 00:04:52,548
Happy dance, happy dance ... we love doing the happy dance.

69
00:04:53,023 -> 00:04:53,939
Happier

70
00:04:54,445 -> 00:04:57,993
Happy dance, happy dance ... we love doing the happy dance.

71
00:05:02,413 -> 00:05:06,740
Remember, half a can of wet food on a plate
and half a can of dry on the other

72
00:05:07,543 -> 00:05:10,507
I like the juice of the wet on dry food

73
00:05:11,523 -> 00:05:13,568
A marshmallow also likes you more than your brothers

74
00:05:14,543 -> 00:05:16,462
Everyone likes you more than your brothers

75
00:05:17,303 -> 00:05:19,320
One day you will be president

76
00:05:19,760 -> 00:05:22,076
And the higher your finish with wolves

77
00:05:22,756 -> 00:05:24,085
Your marshmallow drops

78
00:05:35,600 -> 00:05:38,068
Marshmallow Okay, stop hiding.

79
00:05:39,430 -> 00:05:40,677
Come kitty kitty

80
00:05:43,540 -> 00:05:44,401
Okay let's go.

81
00:05:53,167 -> 00:05:55,087
Please do not leave marshmallow

82
00:05:55,912 -> 00:05:59,868
Do not be afraid marshmallow
are just drops, see?

83
00:06:03,171 -> 00:06:04,351
marshmallow

84
00:06:17,958 -> 00:06:18,956
Happy Saturday, Francis!

85
00:06:42,040 -> 00:06:42,771
Dala back

86
00:06:47,354 -> 00:06:49,053
Mom can I borrow the car to go to the house of Richie?

87
00:06:49,411 -> 00:06:51,363
-No
- Why not?

88
00:06:52,034 -> 00:06:54,178
Because when you return the car is always dirty

89
00:06:54,460 -> 00:06:57,786
That is so unfair, always assume
bad things about me

90
00:06:57,786 -> 00:06:59,885
I assume? ... I see.

91
00:07:00,144 -> 00:07:03,271
How do you demonstrate that mature if
never give me a chance?

92
00:07:03,868 -> 00:07:05,065
Okay, I hear you

93
00:07:05,552 -> 00:07:07,800
Okay, what if the car wash before use?

94
00:07:09,376 -> 00:07:11,354
And sweep the leaves and wipe the drain

95
00:07:11,569 -> 00:07:13,457
And if that's not enough cleanse the entire attic.

96
00:07:14,052 -> 00:07:15,226
Mom, give him a break.

97
00:07:16,270 -> 00:07:17,676
Okay. Deal

98
00:07:18,700 -> 00:07:19,863
Put it back home in one part.

99
00:07:21,582 -> 00:07:22,863
Need to iron something mom?

100
00:07:24,852 -> 00:07:27,120
Dewey, are you here son?

101
00:07:29,739 -> 00:07:31,758
What happens?
You should come back for hours.

102
00:07:32,504 -> 00:07:34,258
I can not do anything right.

103
00:07:35,177 -> 00:07:36,021
Dewey ...

104
00:07:37,913 -> 00:07:38,769
Where is marshmallow?

105
00:07:39,675 -> 00:07:41,833
I left the door open and escaped

106
00:07:43,293 -> 00:07:43,926
Oh, dear.

107
00:07:44,676 -> 00:07:46,066
Do we have to tell mom?

108
00:07:47,575 -> 00:07:49,925
Well, this is a very serious situation .. son.

109
00:07:50,722 -> 00:07:51,970
Of course I will not tell your mother.

110
00:07:53,179 -> 00:07:54,492
- Really?
"Seriously

111
00:07:55,303 -> 00:07:58,602
I think it was too much responsibility
for Your First Job

112
00:07:59,770 -> 00:08:01,411
Hey, do not worry .. we will find a marshmallow.

113
00:08:02,084 -> 00:08:03,893
But what I was looking for hours

114
00:08:04,104 -> 00:08:05,580
Well, that your first lesson Dewey.

115
00:08:06,009 -> 00:08:08,832
Sometimes it takes much time and effort
accomplish something

116
00:08:09,552 -> 00:08:11,144
What if marshmallow is hurt?

117
00:08:11,958 -> 00:08:13,058
This dark outside

118
00:08:14,159 -> 00:08:16,177
Let me tell you something about cats right?

119
00:08:16,739 -> 00:08:19,503
They are nocturnal creatures means that they prefer the night

120
00:08:20,803 -> 00:08:25,003
Although coyotes
and wild dogs and Satanists

121
00:08:26,645 -> 00:08:30,502
My point is ... marshmallow right.

122
00:08:30,743 -> 00:08:32,415
And return home as this preparation.

123
00:08:33,865 -> 00:08:38,017
Just leave a plate of food and return.

124
00:08:38,743 -> 00:08:39,322
Are you sure?

125
00:08:39,643 -> 00:08:43,053
Believe me tomorrow morning everything will be fine.

126
00:08:49,145 -> 00:08:55,270
Dad's plate is empty marshmallow was here
If you are the smartest man in the world.

127
00:08:56,020 -> 00:08:56,537
Yes!

128
00:09:00,863 -> 00:09:04,207
I do not know how they entered fail
no signs of burglary.

129
00:09:04,679 -> 00:09:05,302
It's a mystery

130
00:09:05,604 -> 00:09:06,738
You left the window open

131
00:09:07,628 -> 00:09:08,738
Mystery solved.

132
00:09:09,145 -> 00:09:11,065
Sorry .. What did he say what they did here?

133
00:09:11,065 -> 00:09:13,425
We take care of the cat while the owner is away

134
00:09:14,660 -> 00:09:15,677
I do not see a cat

135
00:09:16,877 -> 00:09:18,115
We're not doing a good job

136
00:09:23,939 -> 00:09:24,896
"Hello
-Hal

137
00:09:25,894 -> 00:09:28,146
Oh Greg!

138
00:09:28,377 -> 00:09:30,335
What convention?

139
00:09:30,645 -> 00:09:33,163
Fantastic prices have gotten very good

140
00:09:33,868 -> 00:09:36,423
Not believe the kind of idiots that are here

141
00:09:37,428 -> 00:09:39,972
Anyway, I call to see how it's marshmallow.

142
00:09:40,197 -> 00:09:44,574
Oh, well. It's a playful little one, you know.
Lower kitten TV.

143
00:09:45,205 -> 00:09:48,097
That reminds me.
Videocasettera want to reschedule.

144
00:09:48,412 -> 00:09:49,394
I want to record the novel

145
00:09:52,114 -> 00:09:54,023
Oh, sure.
No problem.

146
00:09:54,727 -> 00:10:00,417
Hey hal. Will think I am strange but ..
Can you put a marshmallow on the phone?

147
00:10:02,209 -> 00:10:06,615
Oh yeah .. if you let him up. Here it is.

148
00:10:08,835 -> 00:10:10,118
Well I have his ear to the phone.

149
00:10:10,675 -> 00:10:13,476
Marshmallow Hello Kitty how are you cute?

150
00:10:13,926 -> 00:10:15,832
"You've done well today?

151
00:10:21,642 -> 00:10:22,851
I love tiny

152
00:10:23,113 -> 00:10:24,799
Give Daddy a kiss

153
00:10:26,751 -> 00:10:27,705
"Marshmallow?

154
00:10:30,019 -> 00:10:32,634
Let me tell Reese are doing a great job
I am very impressed.

155
00:10:34,363 -> 00:10:34,944
Thanks

156
00:10:35,627 -> 00:10:36,244
Here?

157
00:10:37,113 -> 00:10:38,457
Naa beyond.

158
00:10:40,899 -> 00:10:43,770
I just want you to remember
Malcolm has done nothing

159
00:10:43,770 -> 00:10:46,533
And I've loaded all
parties all week

160
00:10:47,095 -> 00:10:50,646
Your enthusiasm and your pathetic act of desperation
not go unnoticed

161
00:10:51,080 -> 00:10:51,783
Take Fracis

162
00:10:52,788 -> 00:10:53,395
What is this?

163
00:10:53,737 -> 00:10:57,112
Your work on the history of the novel
Is 10 guaranteed

164
00:10:57,392 -> 00:11:00,364
You fail the rest of
semester and a 7

165
00:11:03,548 -> 00:11:04,613
I am delighted

166
00:11:19,017 -> 00:11:20,978
marshmallow
marshmallow look.

167
00:11:22,003 -> 00:11:23,364
Join Hal

168
00:11:33,569 -> 00:11:35,051
Come here marshmallow

169
00:11:58,454 -> 00:11:59,065
What happens?

170
00:12:01,161 -> 00:12:01,961
What?

171
00:12:02,470 -> 00:12:06,353
You know I realized something you can do
the task of Francis for 10 years ...

172
00:12:06,924 -> 00:12:09,291
... But no anger to rage in the cage if you're punished.

173
00:12:09,658 -> 00:12:10,829
What are you talking about?

174
00:12:12,205 -> 00:12:13,291
Mom!

175
00:12:22,895 -> 00:12:24,117
What is happening to you Reese?

176
00:12:24,488 -> 00:12:27,673
You have to see what he did to Malcolm Dewey
Toltec is uncontrolled.

177
00:12:27,927 -> 00:12:28,426
Hi Mom

178
00:12:28,804 -> 00:12:29,427
Where's Dewey?

179
00:12:29,817 -> 00:12:31,227
He went to feed the cat Greg

180
00:12:31,852 -> 00:12:32,581
Not true.

181
00:12:35,867 -> 00:12:39,112
What you Reese?

182
00:10:16,660 -> 00:10:18,260
Where?

183
00:10:20,061 -> 00:10:21,261
Here

184
00:12:50,770 -> 00:12:52,534
Dewey "look who I found?

185
00:12:53,302 -> 00:12:54,268
What happened to your face?

186
00:12:54,818 -> 00:12:55,742
What happened to your pants?

187
00:12:57,050 -> 00:12:58,707
Ah, no matter ...
Look what I brought.

188
00:12:59,164 -> 00:13:01,315
"The Johnson family cat?

189
00:13:03,176 -> 00:13:05,270
Yes, the cat
of Johnson, yes.

190
00:13:05,801 -> 00:13:06,291
Largo. Outside

191
00:13:47,767 -> 00:13:49,989
Hey, I found this in my shirt pocket

192
00:13:50,556 -> 00:13:52,036
You got involved so is not it?

193
00:13:52,829 -> 00:13:55,805
Yes, as you put my shoe on the table enbarrado

194
00:13:56,893 -> 00:13:58,095
Guys what's going on?

195
00:13:58,381 -> 00:14:01,823
He wants to punish me for not going with you
but it is very stupid to get it.

196
00:14:02,141 -> 00:14:04,644
See who is more stupid
when this stupid are watching the fight.

197
00:14:04,940 -> 00:14:09,664
Oh, boys. It is assumed that this is a contest about love and turned it into something ugly.

198
00:14:11,144 -> 00:14:11,736
Go ahead.

199
00:14:16,612 -> 00:14:17,823
I am very pleased.

200
00:14:19,350 -> 00:14:21,241
According we can fix.

201
00:14:21,969 -> 00:14:23,518
Cats are territorial.

202
00:14:24,174 -> 00:14:27,285
Bet you did not come marshmallow
in a block radius.

203
00:14:30,865 -> 00:14:32,258
Yes, it has returned.

204
00:14:33,938 -> 00:14:34,707
They are cool

205
00:14:35,125 -> 00:14:36,290
But he never stays

206
00:14:36,875 -> 00:14:39,081
Well we have to think
a way to stay

207
00:14:41,085 -> 00:14:42,568
I made a visit to my doctor

208
00:14:43,204 -> 00:14:44,083
What are these?

209
00:14:44,422 -> 00:14:46,195
Are sleeping pills, Dewey.

210
00:14:47,632 -> 00:14:50,290
I just told him I have not slept in several nights

211
00:14:50,563 -> 00:14:53,383
There are problems with the wife and
I can lose the house

212
00:14:55,141 -> 00:14:58,985
Do not worry son these are lies
I said to get drugs under registration.

213
00:14:59,835 -> 00:15:04,787
Well, just grind a few.
I will put in their food and sweet dreams marshmallow.

214
00:15:05,675 -> 00:15:07,204
What we put in the wet or dry?

215
00:15:07,550 -> 00:15:09,941
In the wet on dry, milk,
have to cover every child.

216
00:15:10,817 -> 00:15:12,383
Let's catch this cat.

217
00:15:19,259 -> 00:15:20,250
What is marshmallow?

218
00:15:21,676 -> 00:15:22,970
That is another challenge.

219
00:15:23,797 -> 00:15:24,816
Make three piles

220
00:15:25,141 -> 00:15:29,036
Marshmallow probably not, definitely
not marshmallow and is not even a cat.

221
00:15:29,649 -> 00:15:30,471
Start the opossum.

222
00:15:32,006 -> 00:15:33,070
I think it's time to call Mom.

223
00:15:34,177 -> 00:15:35,314
I was hoping you'd say that.

224
00:15:39,020 -> 00:15:40,830
Rage in the Cage
Rage in the cage.

225
00:15:41,704 -> 00:15:42,316
What are you doing?

226
00:15:42,844 -> 00:15:44,928
I let mom see you break
my microscope.

227
00:15:45,455 -> 00:15:46,361
You do not have the Hagall

228
00:15:46,877 -> 00:15:47,895
Say you give Reese

229
00:15:48,552 -> 00:15:52,016
No! You'll be liable when Mom
see the blow you gave me.

230
00:15:55,007 -> 00:15:55,801
What are you doing?

231
00:15:59,611 -> 00:16:00,633
Imbecile

232
00:16:01,596 -> 00:16:02,319
Oh yeah?

233
00:16:14,942 -> 00:16:17,979
Hey, Hey ... this is not for tickets ... do you?

234
00:16:18,190 -> 00:16:20,204
You have to decide who will go with you.

235
00:16:21,601 -> 00:16:23,145
Yes, maybe I should tell you something.

236
00:16:23,145 -> 00:16:27,081
I met a girl on hamburgers
And guess what? I like the fights

237
00:16:27,784 -> 00:16:29,236
What? You can not ...

238
00:16:29,769 -> 00:16:32,987
Boys is a girl! ... he likes the fights ..

239
00:16:33,690 -> 00:16:35,266
I am a victim as much as you

240
00:16:38,143 -> 00:16:39,945
Will understand when they are older.

241
00:16:40,423 -> 00:16:41,269
You are great.

242
00:16:41,769 -> 00:16:43,353
Will definitely bring the programs.

243
00:16:46,987 -> 00:16:50,195
You say that none of these is marshmallow
What is the matter with you?

244
00:16:50,663 -> 00:16:53,864
We Lois is a complicated situation
do not blame Dewey.

245
00:16:54,550 -> 00:16:56,067
I'm not blaming Dewey.

246
00:16:57,508 -> 00:17:00,080
"Mama, maybe ..
"Okay son let your mom take care.

247
00:17:00,954 -> 00:17:02,085
This is what we ...

248
00:17:04,287 -> 00:17:07,329
Okay I'll say it was really a bad idea.

249
00:17:09,912 -> 00:17:12,268
I'll tell you never saw so many
cats run so fast ..

250
00:17:13,146 -> 00:17:14,751
Hal How could this happen?

251
00:17:15,236 -> 00:17:16,600
Greg's life ruined

252
00:17:16,916 -> 00:17:18,127
No, it was not our fault Lois

253
00:17:18,564 -> 00:17:21,969
We need you to believe that
Greg suffers evil eye or something.

254
00:17:22,846 -> 00:17:24,569
Dad is marshmallow

255
00:17:25,270 -> 00:17:29,227
O god, let me grind the pills .. in a minute. Entertain them, not slow.

256
00:17:32,612 -> 00:17:34,563
Or you can just lift!

257
00:17:37,394 -> 00:17:38,257
Yes!

258
00:17:38,737 -> 00:17:40,822
Dewey see I told you that everything would be fine.

259
00:17:46,126 -> 00:17:50,768
They do not pay as other summer jobs but I have the opportunity to teach poor children

260
00:17:51,376 -> 00:17:53,049
Who puts smiles price?

261
00:17:54,082 -> 00:17:55,665
Cute and sweet

262
00:17:56,611 -> 00:17:58,875
This is the first time I go in 6 months.

263
00:18:00,642 -> 00:18:03,455
Then we will make
an unforgettable night.

264
00:18:08,312 -> 00:18:09,084
You'll pay.

265
00:18:09,970 -> 00:18:10,879
Immature.

266
00:18:11,217 -> 00:18:11,752
What?

267
00:18:11,752 -> 00:18:15,813
Ah, it's nothing. Only a
joke of the children at the center

268
00:18:16,373 -> 00:18:19,405
It is inspiring to see rien
after all they have pierced

269
00:18:21,688 -> 00:18:22,584
Oh man.

270
00:18:23,781 -> 00:18:24,875
I did not pass the limit right?

271
00:18:25,123 -> 00:18:25,938
I think not.

272
00:18:31,132 -> 00:18:32,086
His license and registration

273
00:18:32,344 -> 00:18:33,062
Official what did I do?

274
00:18:33,346 -> 00:18:34,680
The car was reported stolen.

275
00:18:34,967 -> 00:18:36,280
Your license and registration please.

276
00:18:36,489 -> 00:18:38,877
Ah, was reported stolen?

277
00:18:44,751 -> 00:18:45,905
And it will get worse

278
00:18:46,834 -> 00:18:48,860
I will not ask again your license and registration

279
00:18:49,076 -> 00:18:51,690
Official Look I know it looks bad but ...

280
00:18:54,562 -> 00:18:56,317
"There will be the boot
Official-let me explain

281
00:18:56,595 -> 00:18:57,594
Open the trunk!

282
00:19:08,843 -> 00:19:10,217
Out of the car!

283
00:19:14,375 -> 00:19:18,501
Mum did not like going for us at the station
of police, but it worked completely.

284
00:19:18,846 -> 00:19:20,093
We no longer serve Francis

285
00:19:20,961 -> 00:19:23,030
Here's your sandwich Greg
"I can go to bed now?

286
00:19:23,392 -> 00:19:25,420
Uh, mayonnaise on one side?

287
00:19:25,780 -> 00:19:26,736
It's a lot of mayonnaise

288
00:19:27,096 -> 00:19:30,315
I'm not saying it is not.
But specify on both sides.

289
00:19:30,315 -> 00:19:30,905
Greg!

290
00:19:30,905 -> 00:19:34,780
Malcolm does not like it better than me
to you but your mom was the idea.

291
00:19:35,061 -> 00:19:37,813
And while you're living here
will do everything I say

292
00:19:38,127 -> 00:19:41,490
Try to be and express accecible
my orders as clear as possible.

293
00:19:41,490 -> 00:19:42,235
Okay champion?

294
00:19:43,092 -> 00:19:45,657
There, the warmed for 10 seconds as you said.

295
00:19:46,520 -> 00:19:48,740
Not yet at room temperature.

296
00:19:49,801 -> 00:19:54,061
Look I know I ask much, but the department
also burned marshmallow.

297
00:19:58,273 -> 00:19:59,928
Okay, almost paid off.

299
00:20:07,391 -> 00:20:10,052
There's something you have to do.

300
00:20:15,521 -> 00:20:16,833
Corten

301
00:20:18,656 -> 00:20:23,643
Oh dear the night still .. What's My Line?
Sorry

302
00:20:24,363 -> 00:20:24,941
Court

303
00:20:40,717 -> 00:20:43,564
Would not be shut up in this mess
if you had not asked for help

304
00:20:43,866 -> 00:20:46,804
Keep pushing me hanging ...

305
00:20:49,206 -> 00:20:51,611
Why laugh?
Not funny.

306
00:20:51,876 -> 00:20:53,426
You can not say stupid.

307
00:20:54,124 -> 00:20:57,377
Keep pushing asshole.

309
00:21:08,031 -> 00:21:09,813
Honey sorry you had to do that.
