1
00:00:03,100 -> 00:00:05,000
Mom, dad ... guess what!

2
00:00:05,101 -> 00:00:06,301
The mouse Perez wine.

3
00:00:06,602 -> 00:00:07,302
Really?

4
00:00:08,303 -> 00:00:09,403
What gave you?

5
00:00:09,404 -> 00:00:10,404
A couple of bucks?

6
00:00:10,405 -> 00:00:13,405
A stone, and half a stick of gum.

7
00:00:14,206 -> 00:00:16,006
Malcolm, Reese!

8
00:00:17,007 -> 00:00:22,007
Malcolm 2x14 - Hal resignation

9
00:00:22,808 -> 00:00:26,008
Made by matiasmab21
"From fans for fans"

10
00:00:51,509 -> 00:00:54,509
See this Francis, I can make milk out my nose.

11
00:00:55,410 -> 00:00:56,810
It's pretty good at it ...

12
00:00:57,011 -> 00:00:58,811
Sadly, I'm just jealous!

13
00:00:59,112 -> 00:01:02,812
Reese, everything that comes through your nose as you return
to put in your mouth!

14
00:01:03,513 -> 00:01:06,213
This toast is not thawed yet.

15
00:01:06,214 -> 00:01:10,514
I'm sorry honey. Meti other toast on the plate Francis
the toaster is too small.

16
00:01:12,015 -> 00:01:15,315
Is it your fault that my toast is frozen?

17
00:01:17,116 -> 00:01:18,016
Sorry.

18
00:01:18,417 -> 00:01:21,717
Francis you have to hurry or be late
Inventory your first day.

19
00:01:21,718 -> 00:01:24,018
Yeah, thanks Mom for getting me the job ....

20
00:01:24,419 -> 00:01:27,019
My friends will spend the spring rafting
in the river ...

21
00:01:27,020 -> 00:01:32,020
... Do not know what will be jealous when they know I'm counting
shampoo bottles in the lucky 8.

22
00:01:32,021 -> 00:01:36,221
Sorry Francis, but it fits perfect. We needed people and
had no choice.

23
00:01:37,622 -> 00:01:39,122
Look at the sexy teacher!

24
00:01:39,623 -> 00:01:42,223
Dad, are you going to carry all that crap to the class of Dewey?

25
00:01:42,224 -> 00:01:46,524
If Malcolm, this is my first presentation I want to surprise them.

26
00:01:46,625 -> 00:01:48,825
I want that Dewey is proud of this man.

27
00:01:49,426 -> 00:01:51,026
One of the four would not be so bad.

28
00:01:51,027 -> 00:01:52,427
Dad, boys 6 years.

29
00:01:52,428 -> 00:01:56,728
So we have to be fun, start with the scheme
and countless statistics.

30
00:01:56,729 -> 00:01:58,229
Do I have to do this?

31
00:01:58,230 -> 00:02:00,130
Malcolm Relax, your teacher says it's OK ...

32
00:02:00,131 -> 00:02:01,831
... Will give you notes after school.

33
00:02:02,532 -> 00:02:04,832
You know, I'm hoping that as it arrives.

34
00:02:05,933 -> 00:02:07,833
I think this is going to be fun.

35
00:02:08,534 -> 00:02:17,334
Well no, not everything I do ... I ... there are some things
important .. y. .. very interesting ... ..

36
00:02:19,435 -> 00:02:20,935
Could you repeat the question?

37
00:02:21,236 -> 00:02:22,836
Your work sounds horrible.

38
00:02:23,837 -> 00:02:25,737
Well of course it's awful, it's a job!

39
00:02:27,038 -> 00:02:28,638
Makes me want to mourn ...

40
00:02:28,839 -> 00:02:30,339
Yes, it's a disaster.

41
00:02:30,440 -> 00:02:36,540
Look, you have to understand is that all jobs
are horrible and there is nothing they can do with that.

42
00:02:36,541 -> 00:02:40,141
I mean, are tedious and boring ...

43
00:02:40,242 -> 00:02:42,242
Being a firefighter is not boring.

44
00:02:42,243 -> 00:02:48,043
It is true but you have to take into account the lack
volcanic, is very easy to die in a fire.

45
00:02:48,044 -> 00:02:50,044
My dad is a firefighter.

46
00:02:50,045 -> 00:02:51,445
Dad will morir...> <your

47
00:02:51,446 -> 00:02:53,646
I'm sure it probably will be fine!

48
00:02:54,947 -> 00:02:58,947
So the only reason why is because you like working
not going to die in a fire?

49
00:02:59,248 -> 00:02:59,948
Yes ..

50
00:03:01,049 -> 00:03:06,749
... Actually work in a very high floor and could
something happen.

51
00:03:08,350 -> 00:03:09,450
Questions?

52
00:03:09,951 -> 00:03:13,951
If your work is so boring and do not like, why do it?

53
00:03:15,552 -> 00:03:16,952
Did you leave your job?

54
00:03:16,953 -> 00:03:19,553
Lois please ... trust me ...

55
00:03:20,054 -> 00:03:23,054
... Just ordered a short absence for a kidney problem.

56
00:03:23,455 -> 00:03:24,255
Than good.

57
00:03:24,256 -> 00:03:27,756
It's drastic, but you do not need to make many
questions.

58
00:03:28,257 -> 00:03:28,857
Very good.

59
00:03:28,858 -> 00:03:31,058
Did you do this only by what you said the other child?

60
00:03:31,059 -> 00:03:33,059
It was horrible, did mourn dad!

61
00:03:33,160 -> 00:03:36,060
The boy was rude ... but fair.

62
00:03:36,261 -> 00:03:38,461
His father gave us a puppet theater.

63
00:03:38,462 -> 00:03:40,862
I'll tell you, life is crazy ...

64
00:03:41,163 -> 00:03:46,863
... One day you're in college showing off your stuff but then
need money so you get a job ...

65
00:03:46,864 -> 00:03:53,064
Think is only temporary, but then you go up, and then
a salary increase and a lot of doors open ...

66
00:03:53,065 -> 00:03:55,765
... Except that there are doors, are traps!

67
00:03:56,166 -> 00:03:57,766
And suddenly .. Bam!

68
00:03:57,967 -> 00:04:02,267
20 years of your life are over and say "Only
got this in my life?

69
00:04:04,168 -> 00:04:07,468
To you love them very much but the house ... damn!

70
00:04:07,769 -> 00:04:09,469
Guys, I want to talk with his father alone.

71
00:04:09,470 -> 00:04:10,470
"Y. ..?

72
00:04:10,471 -> 00:04:12,071
Go into your bedroom, we are eating.

73
00:04:12,672 -> 00:04:13,872
Just kidding, seriously!

74
00:04:19,073 -> 00:04:22,373
Hal ... Are you suffering from a crisis?

75
00:04:22,374 -> 00:04:25,774
Do not know what it is ... just know I have to do something.

76
00:04:26,175 -> 00:04:29,275
And what is it you plan to do exactly?

77
00:04:29,676 -> 00:04:33,676
I'm always talking about doing something that turns
in my head for years.

78
00:04:33,677 -> 00:04:34,177
Is the painting?

79
00:04:34,178 -> 00:04:36,278
Yes, I can see so clearly!

80
00:04:36,279 -> 00:04:43,279
Every line, every line, every spot, the bright jets
of carnecí, the bright blue ...

81
00:04:43,580 -> 00:04:46,080
The magenta hues enlighten them. Yes Hal ...

82
00:04:46,081 -> 00:04:47,581
... I've heard this before but ...

83
00:04:47,582 -> 00:04:48,582
Lois ...

84
00:04:49,083 -> 00:04:50,383
I have that out of my head.

85
00:04:50,384 -> 00:04:51,784
You know how crazy that is?

86
00:04:51,785 -> 00:04:52,285
Yes.

87
00:04:52,286 -> 00:04:55,286
You were going to leave for retirement when they give the same to be crazy ...

88
00:04:55,287 -> 00:05:01,887
... Hal, I really expected to see an old man wandering around painter
the house with paint stains on the face ...

89
00:05:01,888 -> 00:05:04,388
I'm sorry honey, I can not just wait.

90
00:05:05,389 -> 00:05:07,789
Maybe it could be the gardener old man.

91
00:05:09,990 -> 00:05:10,790
Okay.

92
00:05:11,291 -> 00:05:12,491
Yeah, seriously?

93
00:05:12,492 -> 00:05:13,492
This is important for you ...

94
00:05:13,693 -> 00:05:17,493
... And discard those five minutes, you're a good father
and husband, you deserve it.

95
00:05:17,994 -> 00:05:18,694
Thanks

96
00:05:19,695 -> 00:05:22,495
You deserve something really great.

97
00:05:22,696 -> 00:05:27,496
I wish I could buy it from you but I have to use savings
for painting.

98
00:05:28,397 -> 00:05:29,097
Thanks.

99
00:05:31,298 -> 00:05:36,098
Felita to all, passed a tough selection process
to take inventory.

100
00:05:36,399 -> 00:05:39,099
They should be proud of, is a great team!

101
00:05:40,600 -> 00:05:44,300
After we foster mutual trust
ready for battle.

102
00:05:44,401 -> 00:05:51,901
As I explain the managers want us to compete with
downtown market so that the inventory runs out first will get a plaque y. ..

103
00:05:52,902 -> 00:05:53,902
... Film.

104
00:05:54,603 -> 00:05:55,803
Yes, a question.

105
00:05:56,104 -> 00:05:57,804
Which of these products would kill me faster?

106
00:05:58,205 -> 00:06:00,505
You're going to start counting the waste.

107
00:06:01,706 -> 00:06:06,006
The begi ... oven cleaner, or rodenticide rodenticide ..
is fine.

108
00:06:08,007 -> 00:06:08,707
It's weird ...

109
00:06:08,708 -> 00:06:14,808
All my life, Dad has risen every morning to
a job he hates with all his strength ...

110
00:06:15,309 -> 00:06:17,009
... I can not believe that not even noticed.

111
00:06:17,410 -> 00:06:20,010
Guess who cared only for my stuff.

112
00:06:22,411 -> 00:06:24,811
My God! What if I feel the same?

113
00:06:25,512 -> 00:06:32,012
A quarter of amber varnish, a paintbrush number 2 camel hair ...
Or maybe a brand collisky.

114
00:06:32,113 -> 00:06:35,213
Camel hair, collisky brand, how you know all this?

115
00:06:35,614 -> 00:06:37,214
Never painted anything in your life.

116
00:06:37,215 -> 00:06:42,215
Blocks have been painting for 15 years Lois, "here."

117
00:06:43,216 -> 00:06:43,916
Hi honey.

118
00:06:43,917 -> 00:06:48,717
Do you have any idea what that kind of stupid work
can do to a person?

119
00:06:49,618 -> 00:06:50,918
Kills your soul.

120
00:06:51,719 -> 00:06:55,519
It makes you the mind and reduces your spirit gelatin
powder!

121
00:06:56,220 -> 00:06:58,820
He called Greg, you should go tomorrow at 7 pm instead of 8 hours.

122
00:06:59,321 -> 00:07:02,121
And do not make much noise when you wake up, I
sleeping.

123
00:07:19,522 -> 00:07:23,022
Malcolm, the streets are said to your father
went crazy at work.

124
00:07:23,123 -> 00:07:23,823
What?

125
00:07:23,824 -> 00:07:26,424
Is it true that ignited the table and started dancing
around it?

126
00:07:26,725 -> 00:07:29,125
They say he did because he fought with the cleaning.

127
00:07:29,126 -> 00:07:30,126
That's crazy!

128
00:07:30,627 -> 00:07:32,127
Where did you hear all this rubbish?

129
00:07:34,728 -> 00:07:39,128
My dad is fine, only taking a few days at work
because she hates it.

130
00:07:39,729 -> 00:07:43,729
You know, all this made me think of something.
What will I do when I grow up?

131
00:07:44,830 -> 00:07:46,930
Do not have plans for the future?

132
00:07:47,231 -> 00:07:47,931
No.

133
00:07:47,932 -> 00:07:55,932
Malcolm's okay, no big deal ... sorry
is allergy ...

134
00:07:56,733 -> 00:07:58,633
Do you already have planned their careers?

135
00:07:58,634 -> 00:08:01,734
Of course I do, I'll take care of
a particle accelerator.

136
00:08:02,535 -> 00:08:11,235
With my ... intelligence ... and my political agenda ...
heaven ... no limits ...

137
00:08:32,836 -> 00:08:33,236
Well ...

138
00:08:33,736 -> 00:08:34,236
How much?

139
00:08:34,737 -> 00:08:35,737
Keisha URIN xD

140
00:08:37,238 -> 00:08:38,038
Better write it.

141
00:08:41,239 -> 00:08:42,639
Is it a number?

142
00:08:42,940 -> 00:08:43,640
Where are you?

143
00:08:44,141 -> 00:08:46,941
Red alert! There team meeting.

144
00:08:47,342 -> 00:08:54,842
Attention, according to my information the center found a
Reyman human calculator type in a homeless ...

145
00:08:54,843 -> 00:09:00,043
But we're not going to let it come to help, so will have
to work tonight.

146
00:09:00,644 -> 00:09:06,044
Francis ... the discount that the candy did wrong, I want
Recheck stock.

147
00:09:08,045 -> 00:09:10,745
Do you have also the 40 in your tummy?

148
00:09:10,746 -> 00:09:11,746
I heard that.

149
00:09:12,847 -> 00:09:14,247
I paid for those.

150
00:09:15,748 -> 00:09:18,248
Things are starting to get really
strange here.

151
00:09:18,449 -> 00:09:19,449
It's Dad ...

152
00:09:19,550 -> 00:09:21,550
It's so ... happy.

153
00:09:22,351 -> 00:09:24,351
These meatballs are amazing, Your recipe?

154
00:09:24,352 -> 00:09:25,752
The same as always.

155
00:09:25,753 -> 00:09:28,453
Come on, something is different, I can feel it!

156
00:09:29,454 -> 00:09:32,054
Well, actually, so did not put tomato ketchup.

157
00:09:32,355 -> 00:09:34,255
See? I can taste it.

158
00:09:34,656 -> 00:09:35,456
Are they good right?

159
00:09:37,257 -> 00:09:38,157
What child?

160
00:09:38,558 -> 00:09:41,158
A girl at school called me "Dewey-Bug-basos"

161
00:09:41,859 -> 00:09:44,659
Is it the same girl who always puts glue on the hair right?

162
00:09:45,660 -> 00:09:48,260
You know, she is doing this because like you.

163
00:09:48,661 -> 00:09:50,461
It's for your attention.

164
00:09:50,462 -> 00:09:52,462
So do not think I'm drooling?

165
00:09:52,463 -> 00:09:54,063
Of course not!

166
00:09:56,264 -> 00:09:57,264
You're right.

167
00:09:57,865 -> 00:10:01,465
Hey Dad, I have a similar situation and maybe you can help ...

168
00:10:01,566 -> 00:10:02,466
There is a girl ...

169
00:10:02,467 -> 00:10:05,067
I suggest you leave it in peace before I go to the police.

170
00:10:06,668 -> 00:10:07,968
Okay, thanks.

171
00:10:10,569 -> 00:10:11,569
What?

172
00:10:11,670 -> 00:10:12,570
What do you mean?

173
00:10:13,371 -> 00:10:15,171
I've noticed that you do not stop looking at me.

174
00:10:15,172 -> 00:10:16,172
Nothing.

175
00:10:16,973 -> 00:10:18,173
Do you see? Scary!

176
00:10:19,774 -> 00:10:26,374
Hal, I have to admit, not working is good for you, you look so
happy, so caring, so patient with the kids ...

177
00:10:39,975 -> 00:10:40,675
Hal!

178
00:10:40,776 -> 00:10:42,676
My God, you're beautiful!

179
00:11:05,977 -> 00:11:08,677
Good team did a great job yesterday.

180
00:11:09,278 -> 00:11:12,178
But unfortunately I lost all the numbers ...

181
00:11:12,179 -> 00:11:14,479
I think I sent my mom accidentally.

182
00:11:15,580 -> 00:11:17,080
Yes, so "oops" ...

183
00:11:18,081 -> 00:11:23,881
So why not begin to run again I will go to market
the center to prepare a new "strategy", you know.

184
00:11:25,182 -> 00:11:26,782
Gorckage, I leave in charge.

185
00:11:27,683 -> 00:11:28,883
"We're putting him in charge?

186
00:11:28,884 -> 00:11:30,284
He does not speak English.

187
00:11:30,685 -> 00:11:32,585
Gorckage not even know if it's really his name.

188
00:11:32,686 -> 00:11:34,086
You might as well call

189
00:11:34,287 -> 00:11:36,487
Also has not challenged any of the decisions I made.

190
00:11:36,688 -> 00:11:38,288
That's because you can not!

191
00:11:38,989 -> 00:11:40,589
What about us when we go to relax?

192
00:11:40,590 -> 00:11:41,990
I can not hear you.

193
00:11:41,991 -> 00:11:43,791
Do not you could use an aspirin?

194
00:11:43,792 -> 00:11:45,392
I'm working for a pirate.

195
00:11:45,393 -> 00:11:46,393
Of course, if affection.

196
00:11:46,394 -> 00:11:50,894
Your boss is an idiot, your colleagues are incompetent and
under pressure.

197
00:11:51,095 -> 00:11:52,895
Welcome to the world of work.

198
00:11:53,796 -> 00:11:55,196
Why do people do this?

199
00:11:55,597 -> 00:11:56,497
Well let's see ...

200
00:11:56,498 -> 00:12:01,498
If you want to eat, sleep indoors and that kind of luxury, you will not have
another option.

201
00:12:01,899 -> 00:12:03,299
But Dad ... he had no choice.

202
00:12:03,300 -> 00:12:05,600
Every 20 years you have a crisis left brain ...

203
00:12:05,601 -> 00:12:06,901
I can not wait.

204
00:12:10,602 -> 00:12:12,902
He says: "Go back to your job!"

205
00:12:12,903 -> 00:12:15,703
I really appreciate you let me do this test career ...

206
00:12:16,104 -> 00:12:17,804
I know it is usually for older kids ...

207
00:12:18,805 -> 00:12:21,805
But he needed help, would not be wrong to decide.

208
00:12:23,806 -> 00:12:24,806
Well ...

209
00:12:25,107 -> 00:12:26,207
Are your test results?

210
00:12:26,608 -> 00:12:27,708
Yes.

211
00:12:27,909 -> 00:12:29,509
What do you say I should do?

212
00:12:29,510 -> 00:12:30,510
Well ...

213
00:12:31,111 -> 00:12:32,311
According to this ...

214
00:12:33,012 -> 00:12:35,012
Whatever you want.

215
00:12:35,313 -> 00:12:35,713
What?

216
00:12:35,714 -> 00:12:40,714
Yes, your score was excellent in all areas. And
According to this test ...

217
00:12:41,415 -> 00:12:43,715
... There is no race on the planet where you can fail.

218
00:12:45,016 -> 00:12:46,016
Congratulations.

219
00:12:46,017 -> 00:12:49,217
Well but that does not explain anything to me ...

220
00:12:49,618 -> 00:12:50,718
I was expecting something like ...

221
00:12:50,719 -> 00:12:57,319
No, boy there are a lot of people would kill to have
professional skills in both the Gulf and neurology and succeed.

222
00:12:57,320 -> 00:12:58,720
Yes, but that does not help me ...

223
00:12:59,121 -> 00:13:03,221
I mean how am I supposed to decide if
I have no parameters to guide me?

224
00:13:03,422 -> 00:13:08,622
I am very sorry that you have unlimited potential, keep
your tears in my plastic bag.

225
00:13:09,623 -> 00:13:11,623
Is this test can not say what they like it?

226
00:13:11,624 -> 00:13:15,824
Aside from disclosing when a teenager does not yield in
their studies ... no!

227
00:13:16,425 -> 00:13:17,425
I can do the test again?

228
00:13:18,926 -> 00:13:19,726
No.

229
00:13:19,727 -> 00:13:24,227
Now if you'll excuse me I have to take the bus to
my night work.

230
00:13:24,828 -> 00:13:26,628
Even if you think that you do not care.

231
00:14:19,229 -> 00:14:21,429
What are you doing up dad? They are like 5.30 in the morning.

232
00:14:21,730 -> 00:14:24,030
Do not tell me ... should I go to bed.

233
00:14:24,131 -> 00:14:25,031
What are you doing?

234
00:14:25,032 -> 00:14:27,032
I go to work, maybe you remember ...

235
00:14:27,233 -> 00:14:28,533
Francis, Can I borrow 20 bucks?

236
00:14:28,534 -> 00:14:29,434
"I need to buy paintings.

237
00:14:29,435 -> 00:14:32,635
Yesterday I bought 6 pots of paint, what did you do with them?

238
00:14:32,636 -> 00:14:34,736
I used them. Why are you questioning me?

239
00:14:34,937 -> 00:14:37,237
How can you use 6 pots of paint in a day?

240
00:14:37,338 -> 00:14:39,238
Francis, please, really need them.

241
00:14:39,439 -> 00:14:41,439
I am so close, is nearing completion.

242
00:14:41,440 -> 00:14:44,840
Do you have any idea how hard I have to work for
get $ 20?

243
00:14:44,841 -> 00:14:48,041
Agree agree ... I do not preach.

244
00:14:57,442 -> 00:14:59,542
Hey Dad, I can ask some advice?

245
00:15:00,243 -> 00:15:03,043
The girl who was bothering Dewey does not let him alone!

246
00:15:03,444 -> 00:15:05,444
Now call me "Dewey" The Dwarf "

247
00:15:05,445 -> 00:15:07,745
I told him cheap shots should be returned

248
00:15:07,946 -> 00:15:13,046
We should find some nickname for her and
expand throughout the school, church and courtyard.

249
00:15:14,047 -> 00:15:15,347
Well, everywhere.

250
00:15:15,648 -> 00:15:16,348
Yes.

251
00:15:16,749 -> 00:15:17,749
It's a good idea.

252
00:15:18,550 -> 00:15:20,750
So what do you think of the nickname good idea?

253
00:15:26,551 -> 00:15:27,751
Well, let's get to work.

254
00:15:27,952 -> 00:15:28,952
What was the name the child?

255
00:15:29,353 -> 00:15:30,553
Regina Tucker.

256
00:15:32,554 -> 00:15:34,554
Do not worry, we think of something.

257
00:15:39,155 -> 00:15:40,555
Another day disgusting.

258
00:15:42,356 -> 00:15:43,556
Too many handouts.

259
00:15:46,357 -> 00:15:47,257
That supervisor idiot.

260
00:15:55,258 -> 00:15:56,458
Be careful.

261
00:15:57,159 -> 00:15:58,159
As you wish ...

262
00:16:06,160 -> 00:16:07,260
I'm so tired.

263
00:16:34,661 -> 00:16:35,361
Hal ...

264
00:16:35,662 -> 00:16:37,662
It is midnight, Are you coming to bed?

265
00:16:37,563 -> 00:16:38,563
No!

266
00:16:38,664 -> 00:16:41,664
How I can go to bed if you can not find what I want?

267
00:16:42,065 -> 00:16:42,965
Honey ...

268
00:16:43,166 -> 00:16:44,266
This is your dream.

269
00:16:44,567 -> 00:16:46,267
It's supposed to be fun!

270
00:16:46,668 -> 00:16:49,268
Are you talking about fun? Is this funny?

271
00:16:49,669 -> 00:16:51,769
This is driving me crazy!

272
00:16:51,770 -> 00:16:54,370
I'm just .. I can not finish!

273
00:16:54,371 -> 00:16:55,971
Well, you have to finish it!

274
00:16:55,972 -> 00:16:56,972
Look!

275
00:16:57,573 -> 00:16:58,673
You're killing yourself!

276
00:16:58,874 -> 00:17:01,674
One day .. that's it ... I just need one more day!

277
00:17:03,675 -> 00:17:07,175
Hal, you must have gotten about 500 kilos of paint there.

278
00:17:07,176 -> 00:17:08,176
What about that?

279
00:17:09,977 -> 00:17:11,377
Yes .. masomenos.

280
00:17:12,578 -> 00:17:15,678
Well ... it's over.

281
00:17:16,479 -> 00:17:19,979
I just had to say ... the center finished the inventory.
We lost.

282
00:17:20,080 -> 00:17:21,680
Chideris wi re ak! xD

283
00:17:21,781 -> 00:17:23,281
Gorckage I think spoke for all.

284
00:17:25,482 -> 00:17:26,982
I'll be in the aisle of cookies.

285
00:17:28,283 -> 00:17:30,783
Done with the rest of the numbers and go home.

286
00:17:31,584 -> 00:17:32,784
Wait a minute, "Go home?

287
00:17:33,085 -> 00:17:34,485
Did not you hear?

288
00:17:34,486 -> 00:17:35,486
We lost!

289
00:17:35,687 -> 00:17:40,087
Spring wasted counting slippers and candy ...

290
00:17:40,888 -> 00:17:42,288
... They say that all this was for nothing?

291
00:17:42,289 -> 00:17:43,289
Yes.

292
00:17:44,090 -> 00:17:46,290
Do you know how many parties I missed this week?

293
00:17:46,791 -> 00:17:55,091
In many moves could have been ... how many girls could
have known that drunk would have taken it off if I had been at his side to encourage them ..

294
00:17:55,492 -> 00:17:57,992
You can not tell that it was for nothing ..!

295
00:17:58,593 -> 00:18:00,293
We can not give up!

296
00:18:01,294 -> 00:18:02,494
Come on guys!

297
00:18:03,095 -> 00:18:04,895
We take it as a challenge!

298
00:18:05,496 -> 00:18:07,496
I will stay until this is over ...

299
00:18:07,497 -> 00:18:08,497
... The right way.

300
00:18:08,698 -> 00:18:09,898
Who's with me?

301
00:18:11,399 -> 00:18:12,599
Why do not you translate?

302
00:18:12,600 -> 00:18:13,600
It makes no sense!

303
00:18:13,901 -> 00:18:15,801
But please .. continues.

304
00:18:15,802 -> 00:18:16,802
That's it.

305
00:18:17,003 -> 00:18:18,003
Okay, we see ourselves.

306
00:18:21,904 -> 00:18:23,704
Keep your eyes closed.

307
00:18:23,705 -> 00:18:24,705
We ...

308
00:18:25,406 -> 00:18:28,706
I appreciate their patience.

309
00:18:30,007 -> 00:18:31,707
They waited a long time so ...

310
00:18:32,908 -> 00:18:34,008
Here it is!

311
00:18:38,609 -> 00:18:39,409
Es ..

312
00:18:40,410 -> 00:18:41,410
If ...

313
00:18:43,911 -> 00:18:44,611
Did you finish?

314
00:18:44,612 -> 00:18:45,612
Yes.

315
00:18:45,613 -> 00:18:46,613
It's perfect.

316
00:18:46,614 -> 00:18:48,614
I mean, is exactly how I imagined it.

317
00:18:49,615 -> 00:18:51,815
So ... watch it ...

318
00:18:52,716 -> 00:18:53,316
What?

319
00:18:53,317 -> 00:18:54,317
Look at your painting.

320
00:18:54,318 -> 00:18:55,318
I can see it.

321
00:18:56,419 -> 00:19:00,519
Hal, I want you to look at that picture and tell me you're satisfied with it!

322
00:19:05,520 -> 00:19:06,620
Damn!

323
00:19:06,621 -> 00:19:07,421
I knew it.

324
00:19:07,522 -> 00:19:08,722
You have not finished!

325
00:19:08,723 -> 00:19:11,023
I can not do Lois, is driving me crazy!

326
00:19:11,024 -> 00:19:15,024
I've been giving painting covers every day and
I got nothing!

327
00:19:15,925 -> 00:19:18,325
Do not get what I want so I will better
forget.

328
00:19:18,426 -> 00:19:19,826
Listen Hal ...

329
00:19:19,827 -> 00:19:23,827
You'll never work until you finish the table
in your head.

330
00:19:23,828 -> 00:19:24,828
No!

331
00:19:25,329 -> 00:19:27,529
You do not understand ... is useless.

332
00:19:27,530 -> 00:19:29,030
You will not give up!

333
00:19:29,231 -> 00:19:32,031
Will you stay here until you finish!

334
00:19:32,632 -> 00:19:39,632
I will not go through this every five years when you want to
a sculpture or god knows that another work of art, going to finish it now!

335
00:19:40,333 -> 00:19:41,433
Okay!

336
00:19:41,434 -> 00:19:43,634
Want to finish it ... I'm gonna end!

337
00:19:43,735 -> 00:19:47,335
We'll put a little paint here, another here and there!

338
00:19:53,036 -> 00:19:54,336
Y. ..

339
00:19:56,636 -> 00:19:57,636
Here.

340
00:19:59,637 -> 00:20:00,637
Y. ..

341
00:20:05,638 -> 00:20:06,438
Amazing!

342
00:20:08,239 -> 00:20:09,439
I do not think so ...

343
00:20:10,440 -> 00:20:11,540
This is it!

344
00:20:11,541 -> 00:20:13,141
This is what was in my head!

345
00:20:14,142 -> 00:20:17,442
I'm sick, all the store are lazy!

346
00:20:24,443 -> 00:20:27,443
Hal, I'm so proud of you!

347
00:20:29,344 -> 00:20:30,644
What I did!

348
00:20:31,945 -> 00:20:33,345
Finally I made it!

349
00:20:36,146 -> 00:20:37,146
What is that sound?

350
00:20:39,047 -> 00:20:39,947
I do not know ...

351
00:20:40,148 -> 00:20:41,248
It sounds a. ..

352
00:20:44,549 -> 00:20:46,749
Be careful, the paint falls off!

353
00:20:51,450 -> 00:20:54,750
I'm fine, I'm fine!

354
00:20:57,351 -> 00:20:58,351
Honey, I have to go.

355
00:20:58,952 -> 00:21:01,352
Francis, we'll take you to the bus station.

356
00:21:01,553 -> 00:21:04,353
The holidays are over, sir, we must
back to routine.

357
00:21:04,354 -> 00:21:05,354
Come on.

358
00:21:05,855 -> 00:21:07,855
You know, all this made me think ...

359
00:21:08,156 -> 00:21:11,956
There will plan because it could end up with a wall
cayéndome above.

360
00:21:12,357 -> 00:21:14,557
I will just enjoy being a kid for now.

361
00:21:16,958 -> 00:21:18,558
There are plenty of things you can do when you
a child.

362
00:21:20,059 -> 00:21:21,859
That's why I stepped across the room.

363
00:21:23,260 -> 00:21:24,860
No pressure, no responsibilities.

364
00:21:24,861 -> 00:21:28,161
Malcolm, how many times I have to tell you make your bed?

365
00:21:28,562 -> 00:21:31,662
Going to do all the beds of us starting this month
today.

366
00:21:32,163 -> 00:21:34,663
I think I understand very well that my situation is unprivileged.
