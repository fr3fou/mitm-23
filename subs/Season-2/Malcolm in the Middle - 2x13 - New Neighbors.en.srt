1
00:00:03,357 -> 00:00:04,669
What are you seeing?

2
00:00:04,670 -> 00:00:07,275
Reese notes.
They are much better than last time

3
00:00:07,276 -> 00:00:08,822
- Seriously!?
- Yes

4
00:00:09,142 -> 00:00:13,347
This time use the same type of pen
the teacher to change his notes

5
00:00:13,348 -> 00:00:16,339
Look, put a 6 in
math instead of 10

6
00:00:16,340 -> 00:00:18,719
yes, very subtle
is a nice touch

7
00:00:18,720 -> 00:00:20,281
This learning!

8
00:00:20,282 -> 00:00:21,282
Two months punished?

9
00:00:21,283 -> 00:00:23,299
3 months, cleaning the toilet

10
00:01:00,266 -> 00:01:01,510
Feet!

11
00:01:04,607 -> 00:01:05,994
So I like

12
00:01:05,995 -> 00:01:08,561
A moving van
in the house next door!

13
00:01:13,638 -> 00:01:15,293
An espresso machine!

14
00:01:15,294 -> 00:01:16,843
Another sofa

15
00:01:16,844 -> 00:01:18,284
Is a professional?

16
00:01:18,285 -> 00:01:20,966
Well, if you move here
do not handle money very well if

17
00:01:21,138 -> 00:01:23,229
Families move
constantly that house

18
00:01:23,230 -> 00:01:24,367
I wonder why?

19
00:01:53,967 -> 00:01:55,936
Maybe the house
is haunted

20
00:01:55,937 -> 00:01:57,237
A table closes!

21
00:01:57,238 -> 00:01:59,327
No Hal!
not borrow

22
00:01:59,328 -> 00:02:01,950
We are starting well
we must behave

23
00:02:01,951 -> 00:02:04,966
I just want a person who
can pick up our mail

24
00:02:04,967 -> 00:02:08,273
you're right, it does not hurt
have allies on the block

25
00:02:08,274 -> 00:02:10,559
In particular, partners
pool

26
00:02:10,792 -> 00:02:14,441
We have to arrive before
the Ridds put them against us

27
00:02:14,442 -> 00:02:15,735
or McCarty

28
00:02:16,086 -> 00:02:17,187
or Whitford

29
00:02:17,188 -> 00:02:19,399
We need to get
before the Whitford!

30
00:02:19,400 -> 00:02:21,305
Mrs. Schneider
is near!

31
00:02:21,306 -> 00:02:22,306
Vamos! Go!

32
00:02:30,993 -> 00:02:32,294
Attention!

33
00:02:33,379 -> 00:02:35,586
When you finish here

34
00:02:35,587 -> 00:02:38,737
I hope each of you
in the parade

35
00:02:38,738 -> 00:02:40,656
Rehearsing your presentation

36
00:02:41,305 -> 00:02:43,215
But, sir, just try it

37
00:02:43,216 -> 00:02:44,576
Was that?

38
00:02:44,577 -> 00:02:48,205
It looked like a physical therapy
in war wounds!

39
00:02:48,206 -> 00:02:51,393
Lord, we
36 hours cleaning and parading

40
00:02:51,917 -> 00:02:54,642
I think that by law
should allow us to sleep

41
00:02:54,643 -> 00:02:56,155
Why we do this?

42
00:02:57,168 -> 00:03:01,669
Well, this was a surprise
but I can not stand the excitement more

43
00:03:01,832 -> 00:03:07,095
Marlyn Academy will be visited
by one of the last living heroes

44
00:03:07,553 -> 00:03:08,418
Knights

45
00:03:08,719 -> 00:03:11,146
Lt. Colonel Oliver North

46
00:03:11,147 -> 00:03:13,406
Retired Marine
United States

47
00:03:13,407 -> 00:03:17,138
Come here, to give
a motivational speech

48
00:03:17,632 -> 00:03:19,761
Lord, is it not a
convicted felon?

49
00:03:19,762 -> 00:03:21,967
That conviction was overturned!

50
00:03:21,968 -> 00:03:23,811
Mine too
and I'm stuck here

51
00:03:25,623 -> 00:03:27,161
Well, if I had ..

52
00:03:27,162 -> 00:03:29,523
a Bronze Star,
a silver star ..

53
00:03:29,524 -> 00:03:33,238
Two Purple Hearts and a program
radio call-in vivo

54
00:03:33,239 -> 00:03:35,045
Maybe we can negotiate!

55
00:03:35,046 -> 00:03:39,875
But as I got it!
You can close your mouth!

56
00:03:45,798 -> 00:03:48,948
This is very nice Tina!
Because they do not have a barbecue!

57
00:03:48,949 -> 00:03:51,270
Well, they were first
neighbors come to greet

58
00:03:51,271 -> 00:03:53,012
Well, that does not surprise me

59
00:03:53,013 -> 00:03:56,044
I do not want to speak ill of anyone
and I will not name names, but ..

60
00:03:56,045 -> 00:03:58,783
Some of our neighbors
have a lot of paranoia

61
00:03:59,082 -> 00:04:00,830
And do not make me
tell the stories!

62
00:04:00,831 -> 00:04:02,008
- Hal!
- If

63
00:04:02,584 -> 00:04:04,448
well, what can
do around here?

64
00:04:04,449 -> 00:04:05,244
Well ...

65
00:04:06,345 -> 00:04:08,595
There is a bump that is
can jump on the bike

66
00:04:08,596 -> 00:04:09,908
Covered him.

67
00:04:11,879 -> 00:04:14,013
There is a squirrel
you can poke dead

68
00:04:14,014 -> 00:04:15,833
that will serve
a few more days

69
00:04:16,979 -> 00:04:20,912
Tambo and dry creek
and the park .. awash

70
00:04:21,266 -> 00:04:23,547
Gosh, if not for the squirrel

71
00:04:23,548 -> 00:04:25,640
My life would be pathetic!

72
00:04:27,193 -> 00:04:29,734
Only the expected "
once you turned?

73
00:04:30,207 -> 00:04:32,922
I think every burger
is a time

74
00:04:33,603 -> 00:04:35,339
You see, I always hasten

75
00:04:36,102 -> 00:04:39,355
Hal nutrients affected

76
00:04:40,325 -> 00:04:41,837
Do you have a good doctor?

77
00:04:41,838 -> 00:04:43,152
Why, is there a problem?

78
00:04:43,153 -> 00:04:44,609
oh no, neck pain ..

79
00:04:44,610 -> 00:04:47,982
or back, either
you type in recipe

80
00:04:49,037 -> 00:04:51,388
no, sorry
My doctor is honest

81
00:04:51,389 -> 00:04:52,794
Too bad

82
00:04:53,285 -> 00:04:55,023
'll Let you know if I get any

83
00:05:05,380 -> 00:05:07,984
I would look not so ...
might be angry

84
00:05:07,985 -> 00:05:09,565
no, it's friendly

85
00:05:09,566 -> 00:05:11,187
Tell the child that
who ate

86
00:05:11,611 -> 00:05:12,730
What child?

87
00:05:12,731 -> 00:05:15,527
That's why we moved
Do not read newspapers?

88
00:05:15,528 -> 00:05:16,528
No

89
00:05:16,529 -> 00:05:19,534
That's better
the photos were horrible

90
00:05:25,108 -> 00:05:26,585
I did, I did!

91
00:05:26,586 -> 00:05:28,127
See, I said you could!

92
00:05:29,673 -> 00:05:32,431
Give me another burger,
Malcolm spat in mine

93
00:05:32,432 -> 00:05:33,432
What?

94
00:05:33,433 -> 00:05:35,036
Malcolm, why did you do that?

95
00:05:35,170 -> 00:05:36,850
- But I did not ..
- Yes,

96
00:05:37,497 -> 00:05:39,204
Here you go, go ..

97
00:05:43,887 -> 00:05:46,008
Why do I look?

98
00:05:46,410 -> 00:05:49,213
What, you want a potato chip?

99
00:05:50,547 -> 00:05:52,001
Enough!

100
00:05:52,560 -> 00:05:54,888
What are you doing, stop!

101
00:05:58,430 -> 00:06:01,597
I think there is more coal
one of these boxes

102
00:06:12,722 -> 00:06:14,480
Is it paradise?

103
00:06:15,290 -> 00:06:17,186
Look at this collection!

104
00:06:18,886 -> 00:06:21,761
Doobie Brothers, King Crimson

105
00:06:22,291 -> 00:06:23,730
- Oh, Chip Krick, great

106
00:06:23,731 -> 00:06:25,037
- Do you like little wine?
- Oh, yeah

107
00:06:25,038 -> 00:06:26,391
See this

108
00:06:37,781 -> 00:06:40,128
Is it a play discs 12-80?

109
00:06:40,375 -> 00:06:41,501
12-90

110
00:06:43,659 -> 00:06:46,003
Why did you say
spit on your hamburger?

111
00:06:46,163 -> 00:06:48,613
Do not worry
Do you want to see something funny?

112
00:06:48,614 -> 00:06:50,791
Stop looking at him
my mother's breasts!

113
00:06:51,092 -> 00:06:52,388
What? I do not ...

114
00:06:52,389 -> 00:06:54,262
Malcolm's enough!

115
00:06:54,263 -> 00:06:55,263
but .. I

116
00:06:55,264 -> 00:06:56,838
Go!

117
00:06:57,949 -> 00:06:59,270
Go!

118
00:06:59,271 -> 00:07:01,707
Your daughter is
biting my son

119
00:07:01,881 -> 00:07:03,508
oh no, just playing

120
00:07:03,509 -> 00:07:05,075
It hurts! Hurts!

121
00:07:05,353 -> 00:07:06,840
Mom

122
00:07:11,607 -> 00:07:15,522
Honey, if you have breathing
to open their mouth and release my son

123
00:07:16,227 -> 00:07:17,733
What are you doing?

124
00:07:17,734 -> 00:07:19,420
a little trick I learned

125
00:07:19,421 -> 00:07:22,081
How dare you
to touch my daughter!

126
00:07:22,082 -> 00:07:24,892
my son was biting
and you do not control it

127
00:07:24,893 -> 00:07:27,112
Questioning my way to educate?

128
00:07:27,113 -> 00:07:28,971
I do not know, not seen eh

129
00:07:28,972 -> 00:07:31,886
than good, coming from a woman
that raises a pervert

130
00:07:31,887 -> 00:07:35,109
What about where you are supposed to look? are
on display as a plate of eggs

131
00:07:35,110 -> 00:07:37,056
- I was not ..
- Emilly, Josh

132
00:07:37,304 -> 00:07:39,992
I do not want to play anymore
to these rude children

133
00:07:39,993 -> 00:07:42,124
hey! may be rude ...

134
00:07:42,125 -> 00:07:44,835
but are much better
your tadpoles

135
00:08:12,288 -> 00:08:13,421
A little help ..

136
00:08:18,262 -> 00:08:20,532
- This is nice!
- If

137
00:08:21,007 -> 00:08:24,583
You know, you may not believe me but
are the first neighbor friend I have

138
00:08:24,584 -> 00:08:25,858
- Impossible!
- Yes

139
00:08:25,859 -> 00:08:28,884
Axes, are the first man
back here, without being an electrician

140
00:08:28,885 -> 00:08:30,991
Well, I have a
confession to make

141
00:08:31,892 -> 00:08:33,656
I also
I have many friends

142
00:08:34,494 -> 00:08:37,060
- To friendship
- To friendship

143
00:08:42,997 -> 00:08:44,856
- I'm not gay
- Me neither

144
00:08:46,058 -> 00:08:47,863
Malcolm, what are you doing?

145
00:08:47,864 -> 00:08:49,560
Get out, do not speak!

146
00:08:49,561 -> 00:08:50,901
Why, I did?

147
00:08:50,902 -> 00:08:52,614
You keep saying
lies about me

148
00:08:52,615 -> 00:08:54,719
We are just jokes!

149
00:08:54,720 -> 00:08:56,835
I knew it was not so sensitive

150
00:08:57,087 -> 00:08:59,900
Excuse me, my friend
thinks you're very pretty

151
00:08:59,901 -> 00:09:01,323
Not really, I mean ..

152
00:09:01,324 -> 00:09:02,741
Malcolm is fine, just tell

153
00:09:02,742 -> 00:09:05,093
then maybe let
to follow you everywhere

154
00:09:05,094 -> 00:09:07,251
I tell you, is not healthy

155
00:09:11,730 -> 00:09:13,629
Get out, get away from me!

156
00:09:18,925 -> 00:09:20,385
Damn!

157
00:09:20,386 -> 00:09:23,120
Hector Damn, there!

158
00:09:23,121 -> 00:09:26,096
Are you deaf or stupid or both?

159
00:09:26,097 -> 00:09:29,651
Could you try
be a little less useless?

160
00:09:29,652 -> 00:09:33,076
Where is the sun?
Did you see the sun?

161
00:09:33,077 -> 00:09:35,978
I told you shall dig a hole there

162
00:09:37,787 -> 00:09:40,944
God, you turn me
crazy with their laziness!

163
00:09:40,945 -> 00:09:43,736
What's wrong with you?

164
00:09:43,737 -> 00:09:46,793
- Excuse me?
- You can not talk like that!

165
00:09:46,794 -> 00:09:50,398
It is a human being
treat him like an animal!

166
00:09:50,858 -> 00:09:54,417
I will try to aide
the way you want

167
00:09:54,418 -> 00:09:57,100
He is not "the helper"

168
00:09:57,569 -> 00:10:01,341
It is not a servant or a
slave is a professional!

169
00:10:01,420 -> 00:10:04,520
A person with a skill!
a skill that you do not have

170
00:10:04,521 -> 00:10:06,585
Therefore you hire!

171
00:10:07,008 -> 00:10:10,074
For goodness sake, pick it up!

172
00:10:20,450 -> 00:10:22,536
Who will believe this woman?

173
00:10:22,537 -> 00:10:24,748
Do you think that fake breasts
$ 50 and hairstyles ...

174
00:10:24,749 -> 00:10:26,559
entitles you to treat
people like garbage?

175
00:10:27,095 -> 00:10:30,960
Hal say you are the worst
neighbors who have had

176
00:10:30,961 -> 00:10:34,539
"The worst neighbors?
that's not fair to Mike

177
00:10:35,121 -> 00:10:37,267
Remember the
Swingers 70 years?

178
00:10:37,558 -> 00:10:39,014
Dad, are horrible!

179
00:10:39,015 -> 00:10:41,287
Look what little I did!

180
00:10:41,654 -> 00:10:43,958
Every time I go, Emily is there

181
00:10:43,959 -> 00:10:45,426
Hidden, waiting

182
00:10:45,427 -> 00:10:49,060
Yes, Josh is saying
these lies about me

183
00:10:49,061 -> 00:10:52,460
Told in school that I was born with
both sex organs

184
00:10:52,461 -> 00:10:54,662
and raised as a girl
to 5 years

185
00:10:54,663 -> 00:10:58,189
The Nomo want
eat, is evil

186
00:10:58,190 -> 00:11:00,200
Are all evil, baby

187
00:11:00,475 -> 00:11:04,371
I think the word in the
we all think is "disputed"

188
00:11:04,652 -> 00:11:06,657
Reese is something drastic!

189
00:11:06,658 -> 00:11:09,722
No, Dad is just a dispute
what this family needs

190
00:11:09,723 -> 00:11:11,896
A common enemy
honorable skilled

191
00:11:11,897 -> 00:11:14,428
and join in a
blood brotherhood

192
00:11:14,429 -> 00:11:17,240
Look, I'm saying is that
before judging them ...

193
00:11:17,516 -> 00:11:20,947
... We should look at ourselves
ourselves.

194
00:11:24,625 -> 00:11:25,982
Okay, never mind!

195
00:11:46,768 -> 00:11:49,040
No, no!

196
00:11:49,826 -> 00:11:52,491
Do you think the Colonel
North is impressed ...

197
00:11:52,492 -> 00:11:55,449
with this group
Cadets incompetent?

198
00:11:56,118 -> 00:12:01,029
We will repeat and repeat
until they get it right!

199
00:12:01,143 -> 00:12:03,295
Okay, one more time

200
00:12:03,921 -> 00:12:05,722
With feeling!

201
00:13:02,364 -> 00:13:04,659
- She is out there ..
- Who?

202
00:13:04,944 -> 00:13:06,239
Emily

203
00:13:06,240 -> 00:13:09,476
The demon child,
is everywhere

204
00:13:09,777 -> 00:13:13,435
No matter what I do
or where it is, it's there

205
00:13:13,925 -> 00:13:15,540
I'm going crazy!

206
00:13:15,541 -> 00:13:17,511
Were not you the
I wanted the dispute?

207
00:13:17,512 -> 00:13:19,777
Malcolm, you know
I speak without thinking

208
00:13:20,622 -> 00:13:22,017
How am I supposed to fight?

209
00:13:22,408 -> 00:13:26,274
I can not hit it, I can not
do anything, and she knows it!

210
00:13:26,800 -> 00:13:30,093
- I'm helpless!
- Reese, is 4 years old

211
00:13:30,094 -> 00:13:31,650
Are larger
and intelligent ...

212
00:13:31,651 -> 00:13:32,651
Well ...

213
00:13:32,652 -> 00:13:33,652
Are larger

214
00:13:33,653 -> 00:13:36,044
Malcolm, could you come here?!

215
00:13:38,305 -> 00:13:41,408
Malcolm, these people
would like to talk to you

216
00:13:46,128 -> 00:13:49,441
Reported to have been entering
the gardens of the neighborhood without permission ..

217
00:13:49,442 -> 00:13:51,821
- ... And peering through the windows.
- What?

218
00:13:51,822 -> 00:13:54,482
So you decide
become a voyeur?

219
00:13:54,483 -> 00:13:56,573
- But I ...
- A peeping Tom!?

220
00:13:56,574 -> 00:14:01,461
But I did not! Why would it?
Have you seen the people in this neighborhood?

221
00:14:01,462 -> 00:14:03,419
Spying is not just about looking child

222
00:14:03,420 -> 00:14:07,871
It's the thrill and excitement
generated to see someone without the know

223
00:14:32,673 -> 00:14:34,307
You still have to go to Dayton?

224
00:14:34,308 -> 00:14:35,308
if ...

225
00:14:35,929 -> 00:14:37,985
but it is only
for a couple of days

226
00:14:38,454 -> 00:14:42,368
- How was your presentation?
- Cool! They loved your joke!

227
00:14:43,954 -> 00:14:47,650
Look at us, we have
flees into the night

228
00:14:47,975 -> 00:14:50,836
A man should be able to speak
with his best friend on the day

229
00:14:51,584 -> 00:14:53,845
Did you say "better"?

230
00:14:55,747 -> 00:14:57,408
Gotta go

231
00:15:15,842 -> 00:15:17,964
This has lasted days ...

232
00:15:17,965 -> 00:15:21,041
... I can not believe that all
lie fell into Josh.

233
00:15:22,150 -> 00:15:25,112
Maybe if I ignore it
for a while, go

234
00:15:25,113 -> 00:15:27,135
Do not people have
a lot of memory right?

235
00:15:27,136 -> 00:15:30,672
<i> at night when you sleep </ i>

236
00:15:30,673 -> 00:15:33,601
<i> is when Malcolm goes to spy </ i>

237
00:15:33,602 -> 00:15:37,233
<i> Better be careful and pay attention </ i>

238
00:15:37,234 -> 00:15:40,523
Malcolm <i> or see your underwear </ i>

239
00:15:40,524 -> 00:15:42,616
What do you do, where you learn that?

240
00:15:42,617 -> 00:15:43,975
At school

241
00:15:43,976 -> 00:15:45,938
<i> 1, 2, 3, 4 </ i>

242
00:15:45,939 -> 00:15:47,892
<i> Malcolm is in front of your door </ i>

243
00:15:47,893 -> 00:15:49,488
<i> 5, 6, 7, 8 </ i>

244
00:15:51,093 -> 00:15:55,180
Oh, my god!
What are you doing!

245
00:15:56,396 -> 00:15:59,086
This is our fence!

246
00:16:00,126 -> 00:16:02,648
That is the limit of the property!

247
00:16:03,036 -> 00:16:06,398
The boundary of the property!

248
00:16:06,399 -> 00:16:09,261
Can not cross the
boundary of the property!

249
00:16:09,262 -> 00:16:11,923
I can see you, do not think
that you hide from me!

250
00:16:11,924 -> 00:16:15,046
Why do not you go
apologize as an adult?

251
00:16:18,672 -> 00:16:21,508
This is very mature!

252
00:16:21,509 -> 00:16:24,941
Do not think you wouldest
my so easy!

253
00:16:31,305 -> 00:16:35,148
Okay, So
and want to be ...

254
00:16:35,149 -> 00:16:39,072
Recover this
When you fix my fence

255
00:16:54,574 -> 00:16:57,089
What is happening? is the fifth
see you sing Candyman

256
00:16:57,089 -> 00:16:58,610
- Where Spangler?
- He says he is not ready

257
00:16:58,611 -> 00:17:00,633
What about making
a dramatic entrance?

258
00:17:00,634 -> 00:17:03,048
North is waiting for dinner
45 minutes ago

259
00:17:03,049 -> 00:17:05,786
to be filled
cheese and crackers

260
00:17:10,783 -> 00:17:11,972
Sir are you okay?

261
00:17:13,671 -> 00:17:15,842
I feel a little sick ..

262
00:17:16,326 -> 00:17:18,262
This drunken master

263
00:17:18,263 -> 00:17:19,263
.. Could be why ..

264
00:17:20,539 -> 00:17:24,133
I was very nervous about
visit of Colonel North ...

265
00:17:24,134 -> 00:17:26,709
... I thought a
drink could help ...

266
00:17:26,710 -> 00:17:29,565
... That seven or eight
means of whiskey.

267
00:17:29,566 -> 00:17:31,225
You have to dress!

268
00:17:32,192 -> 00:17:33,727
The gown ...

269
00:17:34,248 -> 00:17:39,523
Is a national hero
ah done so many things ...

270
00:17:39,869 -> 00:17:42,667
Eh ... and I did so little

271
00:17:42,668 -> 00:17:46,388
I do not deserve to breathe the same
air that the great man

272
00:17:46,514 -> 00:17:48,894
- Do not talk like Mr.
- No!

273
00:17:48,895 -> 00:17:53,108
I am a worm!
Boy am I a worm!

274
00:17:53,333 -> 00:17:56,223
Belong to the ground,
with other worms

275
00:17:56,583 -> 00:17:59,105
Lord, get up!

276
00:17:59,914 -> 00:18:02,659
Lord, stop crawl!

277
00:18:03,731 -> 00:18:05,231
Sir?

278
00:18:07,328 -> 00:18:09,427
Look, we jump the fence ...

279
00:18:09,428 -> 00:18:11,493
... We put the objects
stolen under the window of Josh ...

280
00:18:11,494 -> 00:18:14,111
... And make an anonymous call
the police from Stevie's house.

281
00:18:14,503 -> 00:18:17,339
I know it's stupid
but I'm desperate

282
00:18:17,469 -> 00:18:19,187
Are you sure that this
work?

283
00:18:19,423 -> 00:18:22,076
If there is something that is that
can not clean your name ...

284
00:18:22,077 -> 00:18:24,055
... How clean the other dirty

285
00:18:24,056 -> 00:18:25,306
- Yes, but
- Trust me!

286
00:18:25,307 -> 00:18:26,748
I have everything planned.

287
00:18:26,749 -> 00:18:28,583
Everyone will think
Josh is a thief ...

288
00:18:28,584 -> 00:18:30,454
... His parents are
sentenced in the court ...

289
00:18:30,455 -> 00:18:32,690
... And Emily will be sent
to an orphanage

290
00:18:32,691 -> 00:18:36,096
Bite their adoptive parents
which then leave ...

291
00:18:36,097 -> 00:18:39,709
... And spend the rest of his life
biting the villagers.

292
00:18:39,950 -> 00:18:41,229
According

293
00:18:54,833 -> 00:18:57,570
By god, you
if you are handsome!

294
00:19:11,249 -> 00:19:13,365
Oh, little monsters!

295
00:19:21,203 -> 00:19:23,132
Is teaching me to swim

296
00:19:25,617 -> 00:19:28,150
I can not believe after all
what made us go ...

297
00:19:28,151 -> 00:19:30,502
Spangler was intoxicated
and let Colonel planted

298
00:19:30,503 -> 00:19:33,081
if it was frightening how
crawling on the floor ...

299
00:19:33,082 -> 00:19:34,383
Calling his mother ..

300
00:19:34,384 -> 00:19:35,993
I will see is

301
00:19:39,052 -> 00:19:41,462
- Sir?
- Who's there?

302
00:19:42,702 -> 00:19:44,404
Only me, sir

303
00:19:46,632 -> 00:19:48,255
What time is it?!

304
00:19:48,256 -> 00:19:50,174
Colonel North came
anytime

305
00:19:50,175 -> 00:19:53,827
It is morning, sir
already lost rounds

306
00:19:55,257 -> 00:19:56,642
Oh my god!

307
00:19:58,026 -> 00:20:00,621
Oh my god!

308
00:20:01,787 -> 00:20:06,624
The only opportunity to be
face to face with my hero ...

309
00:20:06,625 -> 00:20:08,997
... And I fall asleep
during your visit!

310
00:20:10,615 -> 00:20:14,342
Sleeping during your visit?
They talked all night!

311
00:20:15,407 -> 00:20:18,178
- Really?
- Yes! you sit well

312
00:20:18,179 -> 00:20:20,504
- He asked me to call him "Oly"
- Really?

313
00:20:20,505 -> 00:20:22,048
Do not you remember?

314
00:20:22,049 -> 00:20:25,075
They were joking
and laughing like old friends

315
00:20:25,076 -> 00:20:26,646
drinking whiskey ...

316
00:20:26,647 -> 00:20:28,577
Much, much whiskey

317
00:20:29,574 -> 00:20:31,902
Clearly, if, right?

318
00:20:31,903 -> 00:20:35,364
If I may say sir,
never seen him so happy

319
00:20:35,687 -> 00:20:37,440
Let it ...

320
00:20:38,282 -> 00:20:39,670
He let ...

321
00:20:39,671 -> 00:20:43,827
Now if you'll excuse me
I have to go to prepare

322
00:20:46,638 -> 00:20:47,652
Friend ..

323
00:20:48,510 -> 00:20:50,680
- You were great
- Thanks

324
00:20:51,378 -> 00:20:53,540
When arrived
the pictures that we took?

325
00:20:53,541 -> 00:20:56,020
