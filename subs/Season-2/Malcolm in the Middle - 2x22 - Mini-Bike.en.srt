1
00:00:01,800 -> 00:00:03,000
My God! ...

2
00:00:03,000 -> 00:00:04,301
Hal, check this out ...

3
00:00:05,102 -> 00:00:07,302
We still have a Christmas present
for one of the boys.

4
00:00:07,803 -> 00:00:09,003
I wonder when.

5
00:00:09,003 -> 00:00:10,603
Is Reese football jersey?

6
00:00:10,603 -> 00:00:11,705
I do not remember.

7
00:00:12,365 -> 00:00:14,976
Well baby you know, we gave
both boys last Christmas ...

8
00:00:14,976 -> 00:00:16,492
... That not even appreciate what they have.

9
00:00:16,827 -> 00:00:19,307
If we keep it for birthday ...
That will make it more special!

10
00:00:19,307 -> 00:00:20,408
Hal, this is for you.

11
00:00:22,209 -> 00:00:24,509
If I bought that player
DVD I was expecting!

12
00:00:25,300 -> 00:00:26,310
I thought I had forgotten!

13
00:00:26,600 -> 00:00:28,311
To be honest, always
I expected to buy it.

14
00:00:29,400 -> 00:00:32,412
Now I can look all
dvds I have in the garage.

15
00:00:34,300 -> 00:00:37,713
* EMERGENCY REPAIR KIT *

16
00:00:39,500 -> 00:00:41,014
Some jumper cables ...

17
00:00:44,200 -> 00:00:45,515
Thanks honey.

18
00:01:22,300 -> 00:01:25,218
This is ridiculous, Craig has been there
inside for 45 minutes!

19
00:01:25,800 -> 00:01:30,519
(8) Baby I hope it succeeds, I hope
get it .. how many people ... (8)

20
00:01:30,800 -> 00:01:32,500
How much will it live Craig with us?

21
00:01:32,500 -> 00:01:35,421
We must be patient with him
burn his house.

22
00:01:35,722 -> 00:01:38,022
(8) How many boys and girls ... (8)

23
00:01:38,623 -> 00:01:40,023
(8) Look at all the people (8)

24
00:01:40,023 -> 00:01:45,324
(8) And all the people ... he does not like the way I am ...
he does not like the way I do (8)

25
00:01:45,324 -> 00:01:47,725
There, we will open the door
bring me the hanger.

26
00:01:47,725 -> 00:01:52,026
I already did, trust me, do not go now
.. he is doing what he is doing.

27
00:01:56,027 -> 00:01:57,027
Hi everyone!

28
00:01:57,027 -> 00:01:59,028
Say good morning Joeyvin.

29
00:02:03,929 -> 00:02:07,029
Good God ...

30
00:02:08,500 -> 00:02:10,430
We have burned his house.

31
00:02:12,500 -> 00:02:15,400
I'm excited to spend this weekend
parents and children in Marlin.

32
00:02:15,800 -> 00:02:20,632
Spending time with Francis, strengthen ties.
Maybe even a survival course.

33
00:02:20,632 -> 00:02:21,833
Do you take your pillow?

34
00:02:21,833 -> 00:02:22,534
Here it is.

35
00:02:23,800 -> 00:02:25,035
Well, I'm going to miss.

36
00:02:27,000 -> 00:02:27,436
Come with me.

37
00:02:27,436 -> 00:02:29,037
I can not, I may.

38
00:02:30,450 -> 00:02:32,038
It is only for parents and children.

39
00:02:32,038 -> 00:02:36,039
Well, you hide ... no one will know.

40
00:02:36,800 -> 00:02:39,040
You could be my little secret.

41
00:02:44,241 -> 00:02:46,041
This is nice.

42
00:02:46,600 -> 00:02:50,042
And do not worry about anything Hal.
Take care of your house like you have mine.

43
00:02:50,790 -> 00:02:55,543
Just kidding. I will not burn your house
that's in the past, totally forgotten.

44
00:02:56,044 -> 00:02:57,644
Better go going,
so do not be late.

45
00:02:57,644 -> 00:02:58,400
Thanks.

46
00:02:59,500 -> 00:02:59,800
Goodbye darling.

47
00:02:59,800 -> 00:03:01,047
Adios.
Adios.

48
00:03:06,100 -> 00:03:09,848
Lois, I know that is not
anything comfortable situation.

49
00:03:10,280 -> 00:03:13,200
Having me around forever
with the forbidden fruit.

50
00:03:13,500 -> 00:03:14,750
And above that is not Hal ...

51
00:03:14,750 -> 00:03:15,351
If Craig ...

52
00:03:16,500 -> 00:03:19,700
All the feelings we share,
That was in the past.

53
00:03:20,200 -> 00:03:21,953
That part is already forgotten.

54
00:03:21,953 -> 00:03:22,654
Craig ...

55
00:03:24,490 -> 00:03:26,055
Do not let that be reborn.

56
00:03:29,531 -> 00:03:32,800
If you can not have a chip in
a locker, put a poster.

57
00:03:33,052 -> 00:03:35,339
I guess I'm not, I can not read minds.

58
00:03:38,007 -> 00:03:38,900
Look ...

59
00:03:38,900 -> 00:03:40,158
Do not, continue.

60
00:03:40,158 -> 00:03:41,500
There is a mini bike!

61
00:03:43,800 -> 00:03:45,260
Is going to throw?

62
00:03:45,260 -> 00:03:47,061
It would be great to have it!

63
00:04:17,950 -> 00:04:19,162
Wait, wait, wait ....

64
00:04:19,600 -> 00:04:20,563
You can not take that.

65
00:04:21,400 -> 00:04:23,064
Does it? It is nothing but trash.

66
00:04:23,064 -> 00:04:24,265
What are you talking about?

67
00:04:24,265 -> 00:04:25,366
That's not trash!

68
00:04:25,600 -> 00:04:27,067
You do not know what is trash!

69
00:04:27,550 -> 00:04:29,068
I am a trash can, boy.

70
00:04:29,300 -> 00:04:30,769
Hey, why not give us the bike?

71
00:04:31,000 -> 00:04:32,370
Maybe we can fix it or something.

72
00:04:33,255 -> 00:04:34,371
How much will I get?

73
00:04:34,700 -> 00:04:37,972
What? We have no money
was about to throw!

74
00:04:37,972 -> 00:04:39,073
I give 30 dollars.

75
00:04:39,073 -> 00:04:39,674
Well.

76
00:04:41,444 -> 00:04:42,675
Where did you get?

77
00:04:43,076 -> 00:04:44,076
What are you, a cop?

78
00:04:53,077 -> 00:04:53,677
Hi Lois.

79
00:04:54,500 -> 00:04:55,678
To get in shape.

80
00:04:57,500 -> 00:04:59,979
Craig, today I work late.
Would you mind feeding the kids?

81
00:04:59,979 -> 00:05:00,680
No problem.

82
00:05:00,680 -> 00:05:01,281
Thanks.

83
00:05:01,900 -> 00:05:03,400
So I'm in charge.

84
00:05:04,200 -> 00:05:05,683
Just make dinner.

85
00:05:05,900 -> 00:05:07,884
Fine, but I'm in charge,
have to listen to me.

86
00:05:09,800 -> 00:05:14,700
Dance for me, that is. Dance, Why?
Because I'm in charge.

87
00:05:17,006 -> 00:05:18,186
We have burned his house.

88
00:05:19,600 -> 00:05:22,487
Look, I was just dirty, the paint is perfect.

89
00:05:22,800 -> 00:05:27,888
With electricity and a dirty carburetor walk.
That could grab Dad's lawn mower.

90
00:05:27,888 -> 00:05:30,489
This mini bike is the best
we've had in life.

91
00:05:30,489 -> 00:05:32,890
This will fully compensate
our years of thirst.

92
00:05:33,300 -> 00:05:35,291
This is the only thing
we shared.

93
00:05:35,795 -> 00:05:37,544
We've never had anything to share.

94
00:05:37,825 -> 00:05:41,868
What I do is go to the headmaster's house
Lindeldon and I will do tricks at the entrance.

95
00:05:41,868 -> 00:05:44,693
Well, what if you use it tomorrow
and Wednesday and I ...

96
00:05:44,693 -> 00:05:45,694
Excuse me?

97
00:05:45,694 -> 00:05:46,200
What?

98
00:05:46,200 -> 00:05:47,496
What are you doing?

99
00:05:47,496 -> 00:05:49,097
Nothing but prepare our schedules.

100
00:05:49,800 -> 00:05:51,198
And why you have to prepare yourself?

101
00:05:51,480 -> 00:05:52,099
What is the problem?

102
00:05:52,099 -> 00:05:53,400
I'm giving the first few days.

103
00:05:53,400 -> 00:05:55,601
So what? There are our boss.

104
00:05:56,450 -> 00:05:58,402
Hey, I'm the one under the engine!

105
00:05:58,402 -> 00:05:59,800
And I who bought it.

106
00:06:00,100 -> 00:06:02,404
If I had not seen, nor would.

107
00:06:02,404 -> 00:06:03,205
Shut up, Dewey!

108
00:06:03,506 -> 00:06:04,106
Shut up you!

109
00:06:04,106 -> 00:06:06,507
Look not even repaired
does not make sense ...

110
00:06:06,507 -> 00:06:07,508
For you go on Sundays ...

111
00:06:07,508 -> 00:06:08,609
No way.

112
00:06:09,100 -> 00:06:10,810
Dewey, you are too low to lead!

113
00:06:11,111 -> 00:06:13,611
I'm at 40% of my height!

114
00:06:14,860 -> 00:06:16,412
So shut up stupid.

115
00:06:16,412 -> 00:06:17,613
Would you calm down a bit?

116
00:06:17,613 -> 00:06:18,114
Shut up!

117
00:06:18,350 -> 00:06:21,615
Yes, Malcolm. Keep sending
those silly gifted.

118
00:06:22,053 -> 00:06:24,116
But normal people do not
have to listen.

119
00:06:24,116 -> 00:06:25,717
Do not talk so much and hit.

120
00:06:27,180 -> 00:06:28,718
And you have no friends.

121
00:06:31,800 -> 00:06:33,719
Mom told you never say that.

122
00:06:45,212 -> 00:06:48,310
Come on, let's applause
to Grew and his father ...

123
00:06:48,605 -> 00:06:51,762
... Who has come from
stages of Atlantic City.

124
00:06:52,800 -> 00:06:54,421
That was very exciting.

125
00:06:56,100 -> 00:06:59,400
And we still have some prizes to be delivered.

126
00:07:00,500 -> 00:07:05,123
It's great, we have many students,
and all deserve recognition.

127
00:07:07,700 -> 00:07:14,800
And the prize for the best history
2nd and 3rd year goes to ... the cadet Eric.

128
00:07:20,050 -> 00:07:20,825
Congratulations.

129
00:07:20,825 -> 00:07:21,500
Thanks.

130
00:07:21,500 -> 00:07:23,627
We are so proud
our Eric.

131
00:07:23,627 -> 00:07:26,128
Yes, some parents are very fortunate.

132
00:07:28,200 -> 00:07:29,529
It was a good relationship.

133
00:07:29,529 -> 00:07:32,130
I almost approve of, but Eric beat me.

134
00:07:34,131 -> 00:07:36,131
They're putting a lot of prizes, right?

135
00:07:36,350 -> 00:07:39,332
Yes, sorry. This is ridiculous
distributes them like candy.

136
00:07:39,332 -> 00:07:44,460
And now, the prize for
has shown more improvement ...

137
00:07:45,461 -> 00:07:49,744
When this boy came to Marlin
bulgar was a criminal ...

138
00:07:49,994 -> 00:07:52,667
had not the slightest
chance to progress and today ...

139
00:07:53,373 -> 00:07:58,729
... In the course of a year and a half
has finally begun to reform.

140
00:07:59,278 -> 00:08:04,760
Have not got it, it is true but
is about to become ...

141
00:08:04,760 -> 00:08:07,652
... An outstanding member of the Marlin family.

142
00:08:08,200 -> 00:08:12,037
We proudly present the cadet ... Gordy.

143
00:08:24,200 -> 00:08:25,238
This is great, right?

144
00:08:26,500 -> 00:08:29,439
Sit with your family, eating together, sharing.

145
00:08:30,300 -> 00:08:31,540
What did you do today buddy?

146
00:08:31,900 -> 00:08:33,541
Nothing, I'm too low.

147
00:08:34,580 -> 00:08:38,242
Do not worry about it, sure
have the biggest head of your class.

148
00:08:38,650 -> 00:08:40,943
And I can still stupid
grab peas?

149
00:08:41,200 -> 00:08:43,144
I think there is problem in that child.

150
00:08:47,700 -> 00:08:48,845
Yes, this is great.

151
00:08:49,900 -> 00:08:53,546
I remember when I was your age
and no worries.

152
00:08:54,600 -> 00:08:58,647
My brother and I build imaginary
strong outside all day.

153
00:08:59,500 -> 00:09:01,248
Yes, good times.

154
00:09:02,550 -> 00:09:03,749
Where you going?

155
00:09:03,749 -> 00:09:04,650
The garage.

156
00:09:04,650 -> 00:09:05,751
Well, do not go alone.

157
00:09:06,550 -> 00:09:08,152
I too.

158
00:09:09,200 -> 00:09:10,753
Have permission.

159
00:09:12,100 -> 00:09:13,154
That guys ...

160
00:09:13,900 -> 00:09:16,555
Genius, you're going to finish a year of these?

161
00:09:16,555 -> 00:09:19,156
If you shut up and let me down in peace and be ready.

162
00:09:19,700 -> 00:09:20,957
They took me out of Kishi ...

163
00:09:23,800 -> 00:09:24,858
Let's see if it works.

164
00:09:24,858 -> 00:09:25,259
Let me me.

165
00:09:25,259 -> 00:09:26,160
I'm going.

166
00:09:28,001 -> 00:09:29,261
You said you could fix it!

167
00:09:29,500 -> 00:09:31,262
Okay, get away from there!

168
00:09:31,262 -> 00:09:31,900
No way.

169
00:09:31,900 -> 00:09:32,604
Noo!

170
00:09:32,604 -> 00:09:34,300
It miaa!
Mia!

171
00:09:39,900 -> 00:09:42,166
It is nobody!

172
00:09:43,100 -> 00:09:44,467
What about you guys?

173
00:09:44,800 -> 00:09:46,468
How did you get this motorcycle?

174
00:09:50,600 -> 00:09:51,569
What are you doing?

175
00:09:51,569 -> 00:09:52,800
The bike is ours.

176
00:09:52,800 -> 00:09:54,471
We pay with our own money.

177
00:09:54,471 -> 00:09:56,372
Well, it was stupidity on his part.

178
00:09:57,173 -> 00:09:59,173
There is no way you
have a motorcycle.

179
00:10:00,100 -> 00:10:01,100
But Mom ...

180
00:10:01,100 -> 00:10:03,775
Not a motorcycle is just a mini moto.

181
00:10:03,775 -> 00:10:04,776
It is a motorcycle!

182
00:10:04,776 -> 00:10:09,277
There is a motorcycle!
It measures 1 meter is made for kids!

183
00:10:09,277 -> 00:10:11,300
Two wheels is a motorcycle engine ....

184
00:10:15,800 -> 00:10:20,279
Francis never understand
has been the perfect guy.

185
00:10:21,080 -> 00:10:26,280
You see, what I'm asking
... just a glimmer of hope.

186
00:10:29,700 -> 00:10:31,181
Just that.

187
00:10:34,277 -> 00:10:40,763
Francis is interested in learning ....

188
00:10:42,854 -> 00:10:47,592
Francis is interested in causing problems ...

189
00:10:47,887 -> 00:10:51,105
... I regret having to say it but
I have seen people of their kind before.

190
00:10:51,856 -> 00:10:57,213
Everything you like to do is circumvent the authority
disregards the rules of the fund ...

191
00:10:57,497 -> 00:11:00,877
... To kill and destroy lives, has no qualms ...

192
00:11:02,700 -> 00:11:03,185
And understanding.

193
00:11:06,300 -> 00:11:09,186
Is not there anything positive you can tell me?

194
00:11:10,400 -> 00:11:11,187
Sorry.

195
00:11:16,956 -> 00:11:17,488
Wait.

196
00:11:17,789 -> 00:11:18,089
Yes?

197
00:11:19,300 -> 00:11:21,189
Do you want chicken or fish for today?

198
00:11:26,300 -> 00:11:29,690
Hey Mom, I do not understand
how much we like this bike.

199
00:11:30,300 -> 00:11:36,091
I have reviewed your tax return and I can talk about $ 1200 if you give me something in return.

200
00:11:36,400 -> 00:11:37,192
No.

201
00:11:40,600 -> 00:11:44,693
Remember the dog that did not allow you
sleep, I can bring to bear .. a walk.

202
00:11:45,400 -> 00:11:46,194
No!

203
00:11:46,900 -> 00:11:51,595
I love her, love her, hate you
I love, I hope you die!

204
00:11:53,568 -> 00:11:56,052
Detailed information on each break ...

205
00:11:56,052 -> 00:11:59,175
... Or information on this home
Over the past 2 years ...

206
00:11:59,400 -> 00:12:00,197
No!

207
00:12:02,800 -> 00:12:03,698
Working, right?

208
00:12:03,698 -> 00:12:04,899
Yes, Craig.

209
00:12:05,300 -> 00:12:09,400
But do not ever wash my things, I am
only touches my underwear.

210
00:12:09,750 -> 00:12:10,901
Thank you very much anyway.

211
00:12:11,800 -> 00:12:16,102
But of course if you are in place, wash.

212
00:12:19,937 -> 00:12:23,197
Well mom, what we think and understand
you worry that it hurts us ...

213
00:12:23,197 -> 00:12:26,230
... But I promise to always wear helmets when we drive.

214
00:12:26,103 -> 00:12:30,404
And also the helmet wearing kneepads
but laugh at us.

215
00:12:30,700 -> 00:12:32,705
Y. .. just drive in the park.

216
00:12:32,705 -> 00:12:36,306
And always asking you for permission when
you tell us and be with us.

217
00:12:36,700 -> 00:12:37,307
No.

218
00:12:37,600 -> 00:12:38,208
Wait ...

219
00:12:38,208 -> 00:12:38,809
No.

220
00:12:39,100 -> 00:12:40,110
This is not fair!

221
00:12:40,110 -> 00:12:41,711
You can not refuse without a reason.

222
00:12:41,711 -> 00:12:42,412
If I can.

223
00:12:42,412 -> 00:12:46,813
No, you can not. Because you have
reasonable cause to refuse.

224
00:12:46,813 -> 00:12:49,714
There must be some place where
let us handle the bike.

225
00:12:49,825 -> 00:12:54,212
Because .. and if an athlete who carry
practicing in a simulator 15 years ...

226
00:12:54,212 -> 00:12:57,086
... Without leaving covered with protective
of a cotton field ...

227
00:12:57,200 -> 00:12:58,216
Yet think not.

228
00:12:58,216 -> 00:12:59,517
Do not bother me.

229
00:13:00,018 -> 00:13:02,399
I do not know Lois, the boys seem reasonable.

230
00:13:02,399 -> 00:13:03,519
Do not get into it, Craig.

231
00:13:03,800 -> 00:13:06,020
Hey, I live here right?

232
00:13:08,400 -> 00:13:11,421
Mom gets no support because
we are united in something.

233
00:13:11,421 -> 00:13:14,122
It's true. Fixing the bike
finally we were happy.

234
00:13:14,500 -> 00:13:16,123
I did not want it to end.

235
00:13:16,500 -> 00:13:18,624
Sure. We were a perfect team.

236
00:13:19,111 -> 00:13:20,125
Still are.

237
00:13:20,500 -> 00:13:23,326
We 3, we will find
a way to overcome it.

238
00:13:23,700 -> 00:13:24,727
We're going to topple.

239
00:13:25,700 -> 00:13:27,728
Hey, wait a minute ...

240
00:13:34,400 -> 00:13:36,529
Guys, I need help.

241
00:13:39,700 -> 00:13:40,730
What is that?

242
00:13:41,600 -> 00:13:43,431
It seems a picture of you and a horse.

243
00:13:43,900 -> 00:13:45,332
Age had masomenos Dewey.

244
00:13:48,800 -> 00:13:49,933
What are you doing with that?

245
00:13:49,933 -> 00:13:52,234
This seems terribly dangerous.

246
00:13:52,500 -> 00:13:56,735
Look at that, without knee, not wearing helmet
Do you ever fall?

247
00:13:56,735 -> 00:13:57,936
What should you do with ...?

248
00:13:57,936 -> 00:14:00,437
We are asking questions.

249
00:14:01,132 -> 00:14:04,785
So, by your logic, a mini
bike from a metro ...

250
00:14:04,785 -> 00:14:07,629
 ... Is more dangerous than riding a horse than 2 feet.

251
00:14:09,300 -> 00:14:10,539
That was long ago.

252
00:14:10,539 -> 00:14:12,240
Before .. Gravity?

253
00:14:13,700 -> 00:14:15,041
I have no time for that now.

254
00:14:15,600 -> 00:14:16,842
I have to get ready ...

255
00:14:17,200 -> 00:14:18,343
... To go to work.

256
00:14:20,900 -> 00:14:22,544
Did you see that?
The baffled!

257
00:14:24,300 -> 00:14:25,645
We did, it worked!

258
00:14:25,645 -> 00:14:26,946
We caught mom!

259
00:14:26,946 -> 00:14:27,247
What?

260
00:14:27,387 -> 00:14:31,653
Their morale goes down, we will get
if we are patient ...

261
00:14:31,653 -> 00:14:33,576
... We'll have the bike for this weekend.

262
00:14:33,548 -> 00:14:35,649
No, it is broken.

263
00:14:36,600 -> 00:14:37,150
What?

264
00:14:37,400 -> 00:14:41,551
I was walking around
And you know what? Are dangerous ...

265
00:14:45,900 -> 00:14:47,452
Do you think Mom will notice?

1
00:14:50,410 -> 00:14:50,963
You're an idiot!

2
00:14:51,310 -> 00:14:53,764
Do you have any idea of what you did?
We were so close!

3
00:14:53,764 -> 00:14:54,765
The had!

4
00:14:55,010 -> 00:14:58,566
She was not going to leave but had not
caught, I'm not an idiot!

5
00:14:58,810 -> 00:15:02,367
I find it incredible ...
And how was it?

6
00:15:02,415 -> 00:15:06,473
It was amazing, do not know how much fun it was,
I reflected with the windows of cars ...

7
00:15:06,473 -> 00:15:08,146
... Until I crash with a mailbox.

8
00:15:09,010 -> 00:15:11,769
Sometimes I feel ashamed
you're my brother.

9
00:15:12,210 -> 00:15:15,370
All right. Mom does not have to learn,
I'll be fine.

10
00:15:15,910 -> 00:15:17,471
My leg is feeling better.

11
00:15:17,471 -> 00:15:18,272
Let's see.

12
00:15:20,610 -> 00:15:21,773
Hi Mom!

13
00:15:22,110 -> 00:15:24,174
Look guys, I was thinking about this y. ..

14
00:15:25,210 -> 00:15:27,175
And are large enough
to deserve an explanation y. ..

15
00:15:27,449 -> 00:15:31,000
You do not have to think of us, do not know
if we would have done damage.

16
00:15:31,202 -> 00:15:33,577
There is something called confidence, and we won.

17
00:15:33,776 -> 00:15:35,677
Reese, I'm not saying that I ...

18
00:15:35,677 -> 00:15:37,578
I'm not staying here to hear this.

19
00:15:37,578 -> 00:15:38,179
Reese, you should.

20
00:15:38,710 -> 00:15:39,280
Well.

21
00:15:39,810 -> 00:15:42,881
Well, I'll tell you ...
What if I take them to the skating rink?

22
00:15:43,110 -> 00:15:43,982
What do you think?

23
00:15:44,910 -> 00:15:46,383
Actually, I'm very tired.

24
00:15:46,383 -> 00:15:47,284
Me too.

25
00:15:47,284 -> 00:15:49,885
And I would do the job
of next week.

26
00:15:51,210 -> 00:15:52,286
What happens?

27
00:15:53,110 -> 00:15:53,787
Boys are ...

28
00:15:53,787 -> 00:15:54,410
Lois!

29
00:15:54,810 -> 00:15:55,410
Lois!

30
00:15:55,810 -> 00:15:58,590
For the love of God ... What happens now?

31
00:15:59,810 -> 00:16:00,991
What about Craig?

32
00:16:02,592 -> 00:16:04,192
What does this bottle?

33
00:16:04,192 -> 00:16:04,610
Craig.

34
00:16:05,210 -> 00:16:07,394
I'm glad someone can read here.

35
00:16:07,809 -> 00:16:11,559
Bringing 14 vials pickles
I ate 3 yesterday, another one today ...

36
00:16:11,559 -> 00:16:15,783
... And 1 and half an appetizer, and now only
6 and a half left in the bottle.

37
00:16:16,610 -> 00:16:17,896
The simple math suggests ...

38
00:16:17,896 -> 00:16:19,797
Did you count that you have in your hand?

39
00:16:21,910 -> 00:16:23,198
Well. False alarm.

40
00:16:25,739 -> 00:16:27,799
Set fire to his home ... burn ...

41
00:16:33,110 -> 00:16:34,400
This is the guy.

42
00:16:36,210 -> 00:16:37,401
This is Francis.

43
00:16:37,401 -> 00:16:41,902
Let's see, for starters, I know how to achieve
raise a cow on the roof of the gym.

44
00:16:42,208 -> 00:16:44,862
That was easy. The parachute was the problem.

45
00:16:45,064 -> 00:16:47,985
Did you know that do not open if there are
thousands of feet above the ground?

46
00:16:49,010 -> 00:16:49,604
Live to see ...

47
00:16:49,810 -> 00:16:50,705
Have you ever told you about that?

48
00:16:50,705 -> 00:16:51,806
No.

49
00:16:52,310 -> 00:16:59,007
Archery, hitters a lot of grass ...
equipment and are not none.

50
00:16:59,410 -> 00:17:01,308
Not even a picture
you in this book.

51
00:17:01,810 -> 00:17:03,509
Look under Pete Sahat.

52
00:17:03,509 -> 00:17:06,010
I do not want to look under Sahat Pete!

53
00:17:06,010 -> 00:17:08,111
No no, if you say it fast it sounds like ...

54
00:17:08,111 -> 00:17:11,512
I do not believe this. Francis,
Does it mean anything?

55
00:17:13,010 -> 00:17:16,113
In a troubled boys' school
are the worst.

56
00:17:19,110 -> 00:17:23,014
Wait, that's not true. Other 3 boys
with records longer than mine.

57
00:17:23,410 -> 00:17:29,815
We are fed up of trying to imagine what
to move up but it looks like you nothing will change.

58
00:17:30,016 -> 00:17:31,116
Let Dad ...

59
00:17:31,116 -> 00:17:34,116
No, not even worry
about anything except yourself.

60
00:17:35,010 -> 00:17:37,817
Francis, I hate to say this but
What am I supposed to do?

61
00:17:37,817 -> 00:17:40,418
I feel like I should
give up with my son.

62
00:17:42,110 -> 00:17:43,920
I can not even look at you now.

63
00:17:47,710 -> 00:17:53,221
I do not remember if you and I hate or we
want but anyway, thank you.

64
00:17:53,760 -> 00:17:55,822
Reese's been 2 hours,
inflammation does not go down.

65
00:17:56,610 -> 00:17:58,123
Look, it seems as if
was a smiley face.

66
00:17:58,410 -> 00:18:00,824
We really need
take you to the hospital.

67
00:18:00,824 -> 00:18:03,625
We can not, Mom will kill us
if you learn on the bike.

68
00:18:04,010 -> 00:18:08,726
It's not the bike, we can not do anything
for the next 5 years!

69
00:18:10,110 -> 00:18:13,127
There must be some way to take
the hospital without her knowledge.

70
00:18:13,410 -> 00:18:14,728
We need to invent an excuse.

71
00:18:14,728 -> 00:18:18,029
Rate me, because I'll start screaming and I have
that silenced the next 5 minutes.

72
00:18:18,610 -> 00:18:20,430
There must be some way to go.

73
00:18:22,310 -> 00:18:23,831
Have you seen the toy Joeyvin?

74
00:18:26,360 -> 00:18:29,232
I do not know because we have to go
throughout the city, is nonsense.

75
00:18:29,510 -> 00:18:32,133
Craig, I swear that is the
Best ice cream in the city.

76
00:18:32,133 -> 00:18:34,134
Yes, of course, that I have to see it.

77
00:18:37,110 -> 00:18:38,035
What was that?

78
00:18:41,110 -> 00:18:43,836
My leg ..!

79
00:18:47,310 -> 00:18:48,837
My God! "I did what I did!?

80
00:18:49,110 -> 00:18:50,538
I stepped on the leg!

81
00:18:51,210 -> 00:18:52,239
"What happened?!

82
00:18:53,210 -> 00:18:54,840
My God, Reese!

83
00:19:01,110 -> 00:19:04,741
For the love of God John, mature your composure
will come to your birthday.

84
00:19:07,710 -> 00:19:09,242
Got a problem?

85
00:19:17,833 -> 00:19:20,853
Take the shirt out of his pants cadet.

86
00:19:21,305 -> 00:19:25,420
Is that what we teach here,
damage the uniform? I think not ...

87
00:19:25,910 -> 00:19:28,644
Lord, is that he came out
shirt to hug his father.

88
00:19:29,610 -> 00:19:31,645
You can not yell to hug his father.
-Francis ...

89
00:19:31,846 -> 00:19:36,046
No, I'm glad you've seen that.
This is what I meant.

90
00:19:36,885 -> 00:19:39,500
Always does the same,
despresia my authority

91
00:19:39,500 -> 00:19:48,322
... Day after day as when ordering a cadet to 100 laps by jumping on the carpet ...

92
00:19:48,544 -> 00:19:51,133
And Francis organized a sit.

93
00:19:51,353 -> 00:19:55,586
Or when I cut the light of the 5th floor
a contraband radio cassette ...

94
00:19:55,926 -> 00:19:58,297
... And stole a generator for them ...

95
00:19:58,610 -> 00:20:01,149
This guy lives to cause chaos.

96
00:20:01,510 -> 00:20:03,250
He was hugging his dad.

97
00:20:03,250 -> 00:20:07,651
And you before you told me yours
without thinking what he might say.

98
00:20:07,651 -> 00:20:10,852
And every time that something like
that happens, he defies?

99
00:20:10,852 -> 00:20:12,153
Always.

100
00:20:12,153 -> 00:20:14,154
Even when you know you are going
get in trouble?

101
00:20:14,154 -> 00:20:16,455
That does not seem to care at all.

102
00:20:19,210 -> 00:20:20,356
I understand.

103
00:20:20,710 -> 00:20:22,857
I'll see you later.

104
00:20:26,310 -> 00:20:27,158
Dad I want ...

105
00:20:27,158 -> 00:20:28,259
Shut up, son.

106
00:20:36,810 -> 00:20:38,760
I can not believe that
plan really worked.

107
00:20:38,760 -> 00:20:40,761
We came in 2 seconds.

108
00:20:41,210 -> 00:20:43,262
Maybe we should improvise more.

109
00:20:43,262 -> 00:20:44,863
And Reese ... How is your leg?

110
00:20:45,110 -> 00:20:47,564
It hurts less when I'm unconscious.

111
00:20:47,810 -> 00:20:48,865
You want something to drink?

112
00:20:48,865 -> 00:20:49,866
Yes!
Sure!

113
00:20:50,410 -> 00:20:51,467
One more thing ...

114
00:20:52,410 -> 00:20:56,868
Do you really believe that he would not see a mini
motorcycle crashed into the middle of the park?

115
00:20:59,710 -> 00:21:04,410
Joey and I as we go. I repeat that I am sorry
I can not look them in the face.

116
00:21:08,610 -> 00:21:10,870
I think we've been tied.

117
00:21:18,621 -> 00:21:21,171
I love Francis. Bye.

118
00:21:21,710 -> 00:21:22,872
I love you too dad.
