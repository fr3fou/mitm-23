Do not you come to bed?

8
00:00:44,512 -> 00:00:47,916
No honey, I stayed all
night watching soap operas

9
00:00:48,922 -> 00:00:49,504

10
00:01:27,601 -> 00:01:28,786

00:01:53,162 -> 00:01:55,013
I would not feel
While accepting

22
00:01:56,312 -> 00:01:59,631
What good is all this power if
I have not a roommate?

23
00:01:59,632 -> 00:02:02,023
Teresa, you could
review the corridor 4

24
00:02:02,149 -> 00:02:04,130
See if you notice something odd
candy machine

25
00:02:04,131 -> 00:02:06,735
What could put Candy
Coffee on the bottom shelf?

26
00:02:06,736 -> 00:02:07,727
ok

27
00:02:08,785 -> 00:02:09,631
Did you see that?

28
00:02:09,632 -> 00:02:11,048
Did you see that resentment?

29
00:02:11,049 -> 00:02:12,040
Is not it wonderful?

30
00:02:12,041 -> 00:02:13,575
Look, I'm shaking

31
00:02:15,580 -> 00:02:17,829
This is my time
favorite day

32
00:02:18,047 -> 00:02:19,873
The time between
leave school

33
00:02:19,874 -> 00:02:21,692
and your peers get home

34
00:02:21,693 -> 00:02:24,488
time when
Children are in control

35
00:02:29,140 -> 00:02:30,436
What was that?

36
00:02:30,964 -> 00:02:32,661

00:02:45,039 -> 00:02:47,441
and think that someone
I throw it away

40
00:02:47,441 -> 00:02:49,123
was under 6
garbage balls

41
00:02:49,124 -> 00:02:50,923
But you knew that
mother would love

42
00:02:50,924 -> 00:02:51,748
What time you return?

43

00:02:55,395 -> 00:02:56,857
Papa, it's rubbish

47
00:02:56,858 -> 00:02:59,125
Reese, with a little paint
and some spare

48
00:02:59,126 -> 00:03:00,327
one man's trash ...

Forward

52
00:03:08,067 -> 00:03:09,117
Look ...

53
00:03:09,368 -> 00:03:12,643
believe that I come to criticize
you did not do my job yesterday ..

54
00:03:13,319 -> 00:03:14,856
But think about it

55
00:03:15,082 -> 00:03:17,747
Consider the task of tomorrow

56
00:03:18,167 -> 00:03:21,068
if you have it ready for
8, would be great

57
00:03:22,190 -> 00:03:23,628
or at 9

58
00:03:25,378 -> 00:03:26,566
Well what happens?

59
00:03:26,768 -> 00:03:28,284
My July ...

60
00:03:29,217 -> 00:03:30,471
I leave

61
00:03:30,472 -> 00:03:31,464
What happened?

62
00:03:31,968 -> 00:03:33,079
No

63
00:03:33,361 -> 00:03:35,723
But it is final

64
00:03:36,022 -> 00:03:38,920
He returned
all gifts

65
00:03:40,535 -> 00:03:42,736
That is a
low blow

66
00:03:43,456 -> 00:03:45,222
Look, this bear
is adorable!

67
00:03:45,223 -> 00:03:46,933
Squeeze the tummy

68
00:03:46,933 -> 00:03:47,925
No, that's fine

69
00:03:49,430 -> 00:03:49,986
Mira

70
00:03:49,987 -> 00:03:52,029
I have experience in
breaking hearts

71
00:03:52,030 -> 00:03:53,021
and I can tell you something

72
00:03:53,022 -> 00:03:55,149
you have to think
otherwise

73
00:03:56,164 -> 00:03:57,946
Look, it's my job!

74
00:03:57,946 -> 00:03:59,876
I do not know what to do

75
00:04:00,546 -> 00:04:02,002
she was my life

76
00:04:02,003 -> 00:04:04,665
My life and my world

77
00:04:04,666 -> 00:04:06,084
made him well

78
00:04:06,885 -> 00:04:08,996
How crazy!

79
00:04:14,730 -> 00:04:15,730

80
00:04:16,778 -> 00:04:17,840
Give me your money

81
00:04:18,466 -> 00:04:20,877
Oh, my god!

83
00:04:22,131 -> 00:04:23,122
Calm down cowboy

84
00:04:23,123 -> 00:04:25,406

so no one gets hurt

85
00:04:25,407 -> 00:04:28,242
I give all the money
and you go from here

86
00:04:28,243 -> 00:04:29,234
OK?

87
00:04:29,941 -> 00:04:30,822

88
00:04:32,748 -> 00:04:33,564
You see?

89
00:04:34,085 -> 00:04:36,342
No injuries,
No hostages ..

91
00:04:38,179 -> 00:04:39,163

92
00:04:39,163 -> 00:04:41,543
I think I have taken
tongue behind my back!

93
00:04:41,690 -> 00:04:43,251
Craig, I have clients

94
00:04:43,251 -> 00:04:44,243

95
00:04:44,244 -> 00:04:45,235
goodbye

96
00:04:45,236 -> 00:04:47,284
Did you enjoy your experience
buying here?

97
00:04:47,285 -> 00:04:48,904
Craig, are quickly

98
00:04:48,905 -> 00:04:49,896
Just take a second

99
00:04:49,897 -> 00:04:51,939
hello Craig,
manager

100
00:04:52,288 -> 00:04:55,752
and if there is something that we value
Customer satisfaction is

101
00:04:55,753 -> 00:04:56,745
We are pleased

00:04:57,712 -> 00:04:59,325
But it seems

I assure you that I can do something
to improve your experience here

106
00:05:07,080 -> 00:05:07,647
Yes!

107
00:05:08,618 -> 00:05:11,517
What do you think give me the money
all the cash registers?

108
00:05:11,518 -> 00:05:12,509
It is a weapon!

109
00:05:12,510 -> 00:05:13,501
Craig, calm down

110
00:05:14,439 -> 00:05:15,902
all remain calm

111
00:05:15,903 -> 00:05:17,686
Go through this 5 times

112
00:05:17,687 -> 00:05:20,543
just give them everything
money and would leave

113
00:05:20,544 -> 00:05:21,535
What about housing?

114
00:05:22,337 -> 00:05:23,267
"Safe?

115
00:05:24,268 -> 00:05:27,145
jas .. customer boxes

116
00:05:28,026 -> 00:05:30,036
I close the door
meets your customers

117
00:05:30,037 -> 00:05:31,457
Are you crazy?
Do we have to flee?

118
00:05:31,458 -> 00:05:33,961
I'm sick of these
petty theft

119
00:05:33,962 -> 00:05:35,985
Do not want to do anything
important in your life?

120
00:05:36,392 -> 00:05:38,027
How, back to school?

121
00:05:38,963 -> 00:05:41,102
Not to steal a safe!

122
00:05:41,866 -> 00:05:44,717
want to work in the cafeteria
forever

123
00:05:46,205 -> 00:05:47,325
Listen!

124
00:05:47,326 -> 00:05:50,445
Everyone

125
00:05:54,933 -> 00:05:56,383
Carefully ...

126
00:05:58,706 -> 00:05:59,967
.. Carefully ..

127
00:06:02,339 -> 00:06:03,672
Carefully ...

128
00:06:10,799 -> 00:06:12,971
his mother will love
when you see it

129
00:06:16,567 -> 00:06:18,661
this if it's weird

130
00:06:18,662 -> 00:06:22,425
who would fill this with hundreds
bow tie

131
00:06:23,102 -> 00:06:24,680
ties that are not ...

132
00:06:24,681 -> 00:06:26,427
Are bats!

133
00:06:37,159 -> 00:06:40,185
Do not worry Lois
It'll be alright

134
00:06:40,186 -> 00:06:42,069
.. All good

135
00:06:42,070 -> 00:06:46,243
yes, still playing with it buddy
There is a big surprise on the way

136
00:06:46,244 -> 00:06:49,133
Craig, that button is offline
more than a year ago

137
00:06:49,167 -> 00:06:50,416
What? Why?

138
00:06:50,417 -> 00:06:52,172
Because you lived tightening

139
00:06:52,173 -> 00:06:54,343
In emergencies,
for that is that

140
00:06:54,344 -> 00:06:56,757
Was it an emergency
when you saw a bee?

141
00:06:56,758 -> 00:06:58,811
Or that big fly
like a bee?

142
00:06:58,812 -> 00:07:00,334
What about when you saw the ghost?!

143
00:07:00,335 -> 00:07:02,577
I'm not saying whether or not

144
00:07:02,578 -> 00:07:04,463
But what we saw was not normal!

145
00:07:04,164 -> 00:07:05,763
Okay, you two

146
00:07:05,764 -> 00:07:06,755
Move

147
00:07:07,340 -> 00:07:10,567
the weapon is moving far
we will end up dead

148
00:07:10,568 -> 00:07:12,111
Craig, of course not

149
00:07:13,001 -> 00:07:13,770
Lois

150
00:07:15,483 -> 00:07:17,890
Before his death,
I tell you something ...

151
00:07:18,273 -> 00:07:19,521
what I feel

152
00:07:19,522 -> 00:07:20,514
Craig, no!

153
00:07:20,515 -> 00:07:21,506
- But Lois ..
- I know!

154
00:07:21,507 -> 00:07:23,611
This will end soon!

155
00:07:24,206 -> 00:07:25,311
How much?

156
00:07:28,621 -> 00:07:31,064
and ensures that
them out to all

157
00:07:31,065 -> 00:07:32,056
What?

158
00:07:33,087 -> 00:07:34,539
Why each bat?!

159
00:07:34,540 -> 00:07:35,531
Are you crazy?!

160
00:07:38,035 -> 00:07:39,578
- Seems to be alone

161
00:07:39,579 -> 00:07:41,669
- What are you talking? Is not nobody come?

162
00:07:41,670 -> 00:07:42,661
- I have fear

163
00:07:43,003 -> 00:07:47,261
I know son, you just have to think
they are rats with wings

164
00:07:47,819 -> 00:07:48,775
and radar

165
00:07:49,242 -> 00:07:51,452
single radar flying rats

166
00:07:51,453 -> 00:07:52,444
repeat it

167
00:07:52,445 -> 00:07:54,097
- Flying Rats radar

168
00:07:54,098 -> 00:07:55,089
- Again

169
00:07:55,090 -> 00:07:56,081
- Flying Rats with ...

170
00:07:59,321 -> 00:08:00,310
very good

171
00:08:00,311 -> 00:08:02,980
is important to remain calm

172
00:08:02,981 -> 00:08:05,994
make no sudden movements
or killed

173
00:08:05,995 -> 00:08:08,976
and not look into the eyes
or killed

174
00:08:09,263 -> 00:08:12,515
and do not ask not to be killed
or killed

175
00:08:13,655 -> 00:08:15,555
- I need to stop talking
-Tu!

176
00:08:15,884 -> 00:08:17,568
Charge, come here!

177
00:08:17,569 -> 00:08:18,560
It's the end

178
00:08:19,920 -> 00:08:21,489
Do not feed my cat

179
00:08:21,940 -> 00:08:24,852
what's funny
think before you die

180
00:08:24,853 -> 00:08:26,572
Craig, just want to talk

181
00:08:28,673 -> 00:08:29,347
Lois

182
00:08:29,809 -> 00:08:32,757
Before they kill us
I have to say ...

183
00:08:33,181 -> 00:08:34,919
Leave those negative thoughts

184
00:08:34,920 -> 00:08:37,552
! Just give them money
and move it out of here!

185
00:08:37,553 -> 00:08:39,388
Can we stop now with this?

186
00:08:39,389 -> 00:08:42,140
clear that someone gives us
the combination of the box

187
00:08:42,141 -> 00:08:45,742
Well, I can not
but the manager if

188
00:08:45,743 -> 00:08:47,932
Craig, say the combination

189
00:08:49,564 -> 00:08:50,513
No!

190
00:08:51,080 -> 00:08:51,934
What?

191
00:08:51,935 -> 00:08:54,224
You can not have it

192
00:08:54,225 -> 00:08:57,228
Yes, they can
Craig, say the combination!

193
00:08:57,261 -> 00:08:58,800
I speak with

194
00:09:01,433 -> 00:09:03,870
What is the key?!

195
00:09:11,522 -> 00:09:14,050
See? I told you I would best

196
00:09:14,547 -> 00:09:17,615
Better, as you might cheer this?

197
00:09:17,616 -> 00:09:23,139
see mature women denigrate
in a place that smells like urine and cigarettes

198
00:09:23,140 -> 00:09:26,691
If you see it well, you move
that thing look horrible

199
00:09:27,886 -> 00:09:31,268
Friend, you have to be nice
with you is complicated

200
00:09:31,269 -> 00:09:34,316
hey, want to see a real show?
come here

201
00:09:34,731 -> 00:09:36,919
-No
-Si, if you want

202
00:09:36,920 -> 00:09:37,911
$ 50

203
00:09:38,110 -> 00:09:39,583
Look, I have only 20
so ...

204
00:09:39,584 -> 00:09:40,575
agree!

205
00:10:21,902 -> 00:10:23,411
Hey, watch out!

206
00:10:27,571 -> 00:10:30,273
idiot, is the mainstay of breast

207
00:10:36,332 -> 00:10:38,248
What? .. What is it?!

208
00:10:45,646 -> 00:10:47,361
Dewey, it was

209
00:10:53,206 -> 00:10:54,635
Do you feel better?

210
00:10:54,636 -> 00:10:56,704
- Yes, I think. Thanks ..
- Well

211
00:10:57,135 -> 00:10:59,849
"Tell me the fucking combination!
- No!

212
00:11:01,499 -> 00:11:03,208
"I can tell you a second?

213
00:11:08,184 -> 00:11:11,791
Look, I want to end
this as much as your

214
00:11:11,792 -> 00:11:16,591
Give me 5 minutes with them
I'll get the combination

215
00:11:18,370 -> 00:11:21,774
Mira Craig, I think these
Men talk seriously

216
00:11:21,775 -> 00:11:25,499
and you and I know that there are fewer
$ 700 in that box

217
00:11:25,500 -> 00:11:29,028
Do you think that the lives of seven employees
worth less than $ 700?

218
00:11:29,128 -> 00:11:31,197
Lois, this is not just about money

219
00:11:31,198 -> 00:11:33,868
Sometimes a man has
they have dignity

220
00:11:34,067 -> 00:11:35,341
And what if they kill me?

221
00:11:35,342 -> 00:11:39,490
But before I kill you will make any
thing to get you the combination

222
00:11:40,141 -> 00:11:43,371
Can you imagine how you really
no eyes?

223
00:11:43,714 -> 00:11:45,621
because it began

224
00:11:46,157 -> 00:11:50,262
can break all your fingers
even tear some

225
00:11:51,279 -> 00:11:53,760
saw the knife
carried in the boot

226
00:11:54,084 -> 00:11:57,596
Do you really want to face
at about Craig?

227
00:11:58,072 -> 00:12:01,806
Want to feel as
slips through your body?

228
00:12:02,874 -> 00:12:03,917
Craig, do not faint!

229
00:12:06,902 -> 00:12:07,690
Damn!

230
00:12:10,861 -> 00:12:12,376
Pass the salt, please

231
00:12:14,173 -> 00:12:16,079
How long have we here?

232
00:12:16,080 -> 00:12:17,501
until all the bats out

233
00:12:17,502 -> 00:12:20,675
With all windows and doors
open, just have to wait

234
00:12:20,676 -> 00:12:21,667
Could you get more?

235
00:12:23,368 -> 00:12:26,152
Dewey, well, what about school?

236
00:12:26,153 -> 00:12:27,827
Miky Duffy pushed me

237
00:12:27,828 -> 00:12:29,515
- And what pushed you? "

238
00:12:29,550 -> 00:12:30,927
- No, is bigger

239
00:12:30,928 -> 00:12:32,745
- Reese?
- I'm good

240
00:12:35,352 -> 00:12:37,986
- It's crazy, I can not eat!

241
00:12:37,987 -> 00:12:41,240
Why, some problems in school?

242
00:12:42,517 -> 00:12:44,547
oh, I understand

243
00:12:45,169 -> 00:12:47,628
Anyone want my potatoes?
is something burning

244
00:12:47,629 -> 00:12:48,621
No thanks

245
00:12:49,373 -> 00:12:51,358
Reese, do not prepare potatoes

246
00:13:05,257 -> 00:13:06,964
Okay, enough!

247
00:13:07,762 -> 00:13:08,722
Mudémonos

248
00:13:08,755 -> 00:13:10,300
Mom found us

249
00:13:10,597 -> 00:13:11,292
No

250
00:13:11,903 -> 00:13:13,844
I'm sick of running

251
00:13:13,845 -> 00:13:17,515
I am sick of screaming like a girl
every 5 minutes

252
00:13:18,152 -> 00:13:23,176
I will not let a flying rodent
throw me out of my house, and neither will you

253
00:13:24,029 -> 00:13:27,097
my fault that have come here

254
00:13:27,098 -> 00:13:30,474
But it depends on us all
show output

255
00:13:30,718 -> 00:13:32,542
Get ready boys

256
00:13:32,543 -> 00:13:35,429
It is time to take those
Bats!

257
00:14:27,107 -> 00:14:29,751
well, not what we expected

258
00:14:29,752 -> 00:14:33,944
But well, now you say you
been in a cockfight!

259
00:14:34,748 -> 00:14:36,016
Okay Dewey

260
00:14:36,017 -> 00:14:38,797
There is only one bat
and is in the room your mother

261
00:14:38,798 -> 00:14:40,638
and this is the clever

262
00:14:40,639 -> 00:14:42,982
the only one who escaped
of all traps

263
00:14:42,983 -> 00:14:44,818
- What do you call?
- Sly

264
00:14:44,819 -> 00:14:45,810
- Truth

265
00:14:45,811 -> 00:14:47,834
Well, now we have a
very good trap

266
00:14:47,835 -> 00:14:52,194
But someone has to carry
Beating to her and that ... are you

267
00:14:52,195 -> 00:14:53,186
Why me?

268
00:14:53,521 -> 00:14:56,133
Because your hair is shorter

269
00:14:56,134 -> 00:14:59,066
if it lands on your head
bite once and anger

270
00:14:59,067 -> 00:15:01,313
But in my head
or that of your brothers

271
00:15:01,314 -> 00:15:04,745
become entangled and bite
to kill

272
00:15:04,799 -> 00:15:06,692
- Do you understand?
- If

273
00:15:06,693 -> 00:15:07,687
Very good!

274
00:15:10,053 -> 00:15:14,444
Now, I want you to come and hit him
until you begin to follow

275
00:15:15,948 -> 00:15:17,139
Good luck!

276
00:16:05,957 -> 00:16:09,530
not you, but I'm
very proud of us

277
00:16:15,619 -> 00:16:18,444
well, someone who
search mop

278
00:16:26,027 -> 00:16:27,415
"Lois, are you okay?!

279
00:16:27,415 -> 00:16:29,239
No, I'm not okay

280
00:16:29,732 -> 00:16:34,386
I'm sitting here, being threatened
just because they want to give them the key

281
00:16:34,387 -> 00:16:35,745
I can not do that

282
00:16:35,746 -> 00:16:40,655
Craig please, I have fear
want to go home with my family

283
00:16:41,308 -> 00:16:43,349
I never knew the combination

284
00:16:44,133 -> 00:16:45,984
What did you say?

285
00:16:46,040 -> 00:16:49,264
I never gave it
said they can not communicate it to me

286
00:16:49,265 -> 00:16:51,552
gave it to the lab
Photography

287
00:16:51,553 -> 00:16:54,279
comes at night and
transfers made

288
00:16:54,707 -> 00:16:57,151
Why do not you say so?

289
00:16:57,152 -> 00:17:01,954
no, I guess that was in a hurry
we all know how pathetic I am

290
00:17:05,135 -> 00:17:06,742
Craig oh, sorry

291
00:17:06,743 -> 00:17:08,185
Lois, I love you

292
00:17:09,203 -> 00:17:10,010
What?

293
00:17:10,011 -> 00:17:14,507
I love you with all my heart
You are my reason for living, are all

294
00:17:14,508 -> 00:17:15,499
Craig ..

295
00:17:15,500 -> 00:17:17,053
Lois, I do not feel well

296
00:17:17,054 -> 00:17:19,681
I know you are married and
have 4 beautiful children

297
00:17:19,682 -> 00:17:20,673
It is my heart

298
00:17:21,746 -> 00:17:25,707
I wish I have it
but I have

299
00:17:26,108 -> 00:17:27,742
I can not help loving

300
00:17:27,743 -> 00:17:31,181
I can not help loving
my foolish heart

301
00:17:32,834 -> 00:17:34,691
Craig O

302
00:17:34,937 -> 00:17:36,926
Why did you say that ..

303
00:17:38,920 -> 00:17:41,363
Craig Dear, sweet

304
00:17:43,199 -> 00:17:46,705
Really sorry

305
00:17:47,160 -> 00:17:48,830
I'm sorry for how you feel

306
00:17:49,494 -> 00:17:53,808
I'm sorry if I said something that made beyond
believe it was more than a friend

307
00:17:53,809 -> 00:17:56,979
"And I'm sorry for what
I have to do now!

308
00:17:57,223 -> 00:17:58,640
For now ..

309
00:17:58,745 -> 00:18:03,193
I have to destroy what made you
do what you've done

310
00:18:03,194 -> 00:18:07,237
I have to make a lot of damage ..
But believe me, Craig,

311
00:18:07,238 -> 00:18:09,229
It's for your own good

312
00:18:09,869 -> 00:18:11,208
Number 1

313
00:18:12,179 -> 00:18:15,160
No, to everything you just said

314
00:18:15,161 -> 00:18:18,826
Not what you think
Not what you dream

315
00:18:18,827 -> 00:18:20,472
Not your "what if .."

316
00:18:20,472 -> 00:18:26,083
No to your fantasies, desires
or dream that involves both

317
00:18:26,084 -> 00:18:29,752
No, no, no ...

318
00:18:30,716 -> 00:18:32,553
Number 2

319
00:18:33,963 -> 00:18:36,179
Remember that pain ...

320
00:18:36,739 -> 00:18:39,955
When you wonder if there
something more than a "hello"

321
00:18:39,956 -> 00:18:43,323
When you greet the morning.
Remember this pain

322
00:18:43,522 -> 00:18:46,821
You have no future with me.
You have nothing ..

323
00:18:46,822 -> 00:18:47,814
Me

324
00:18:57,487 -> 00:18:59,225
Friend, whose face you

325
00:19:06,959 -> 00:19:11,500
You want it?
Do you want the stupid box?

326
00:19:14,773 -> 00:19:16,619
Here's your stupid box

327
00:19:20,513 -> 00:19:21,480
Great!

328
00:19:26,645 -> 00:19:28,603
"Craig, are you okay?

329
00:19:29,030 -> 00:19:29,596
Do not know

330
00:19:30,166 -> 00:19:33,996
I felt something break, and if they were not
my pants were inside me

331
00:19:35,913 -> 00:19:39,226
"I told you?, Fights
illegal cock

332
00:19:39,227 -> 00:19:42,177
at least you won something.
How much, $ 10?

333
00:19:42,178 -> 00:19:44,158
should be glad

334
00:19:44,159 -> 00:19:46,913
We're going to jail!

335
00:19:46,914 -> 00:19:49,928
When they find out my parents
I will be in high school

336
00:19:49,929 -> 00:19:51,498
To be emancipated!

337
00:19:51,499 -> 00:19:54,248
Do not you realize
how serious is this, right?

338
00:19:57,170 -> 00:19:59,157
You know funny thing is?

339
00:19:59,555 -> 00:20:01,920
You made me see things
in perspective

340
00:20:01,921 -> 00:20:06,852
There are worse things than losing your girlfriend
and experience all tonight

341
00:20:07,051 -> 00:20:09,758
Thanks Francis
I owe you

342
00:20:10,219 -> 00:20:13,436
I think I'll be back in
movement soon

343
00:20:15,217 -> 00:20:16,774
You never know

344
00:20:19,497 -> 00:20:22,035
Craig, the manager attacked
with safe

345
00:20:22,036 -> 00:20:23,576
Never seen anything like it

346
00:20:23,821 -> 00:20:25,252
He is a hero

347
00:21:11,719 -> 00:21:13,603
worked late

348
00:21:14,311 -> 00:21:15,854
What was your night?

349
00:21:15,855 -> 00:21:17,573
Well ..

350
00:21:18,074 -> 00:21:19,066
Does yours?

351
00:21:20,823 -> 00:21:22,333
Well

352
00:21:24,346 -> 00:21:27,426
Why is there a closet
in the dining room?

353
00:21:27,923 -> 00:21:29,931
Happy Anniversary

354
00:21:41,507 -> 00:21:45,503
