1
00:00:17,761 -> 00:00:19,744
Pancakes Rich Dad!

2
00:00:20,958 -> 00:00:24,620
Oh, thanks!
Who wants more?

3
00:00:25,991 -> 00:00:27,284
I want!

4
00:01:03,473 -> 00:01:06,603
Which of these ballots
not want to pay this month?

5
00:01:06,604 -> 00:01:08,015
Is the cable or visa?

6
00:01:08,016 -> 00:01:09,920
The cable ...

7
00:01:09,921 -> 00:01:11,909
can be fun
come together as a family ...

8
00:01:11,910 -> 00:01:13,424
play board games,
sing songs

9
00:01:13,425 -> 00:01:14,768
Well, I understood the point

10
00:01:14,769 -> 00:01:15,769
Pay cable

11
00:01:16,873 -> 00:01:20,491
oh, my god, freezer
is broken again

12
00:01:20,581 -> 00:01:21,512
What?

13
00:01:21,513 -> 00:01:25,462
- They just fix it
- I know, is a junk

14
00:01:26,309 -> 00:01:29,815
Just 5 years
How does it break so much?

15
00:01:38,421 -> 00:01:41,580
Bring the garage fridge
maybe that works

16
00:01:42,803 -> 00:01:45,390
That breast decide! That
lost taking bath water!

17
00:01:45,391 -> 00:01:46,391
All right!

18
00:01:46,392 -> 00:01:48,290
Mama, who has
longest tongue?

19
00:01:50,888 -> 00:01:54,153
Are they going to make us stay
stand here all day?

20
00:01:54,154 -> 00:01:56,508
Mom, Dad!

21
00:01:56,509 -> 00:01:57,891
Oh, my god! Honey!

22
00:01:58,173 -> 00:02:00,264
Your parents are here!

23
00:02:07,672 -> 00:02:10,411
Your grandparents Dewey
are here!

24
00:02:10,412 -> 00:02:11,385
Hello!

25
00:02:12,513 -> 00:02:14,779
- Adelante
- Do not expect!

26
00:02:14,780 -> 00:02:17,127
What brings them from Canada?

27
00:02:17,502 -> 00:02:18,485
Wait!

28
00:02:18,740 -> 00:02:20,650
- "This is Reese?
- Yes

29
00:02:21,151 -> 00:02:22,726
What is your problem?

30
00:02:22,727 -> 00:02:25,233
Do not you clean behind the ears?
Look what I found!

31
00:02:25,234 -> 00:02:27,801
$ 5, thanks grandpa!

32
00:02:29,001 -> 00:02:31,466
- Did you have a nice trip grandpa?
- What?

33
00:02:31,875 -> 00:02:34,009
I said if they had good ..

34
00:02:34,010 -> 00:02:36,304
I can not understand
you sound like a girl!

35
00:02:36,305 -> 00:02:41,855
So, they decided to raise the car
and drive up here without telling us?

36
00:02:41,856 -> 00:02:44,389
- What fun!
- If, how long to stay?

37
00:02:44,390 -> 00:02:47,124
If we are a nuisance
let us now!

38
00:02:47,125 -> 00:02:48,125
No, no!

39
00:02:48,345 -> 00:02:49,842
- Please
- Do not say nonsense

40
00:02:49,843 -> 00:02:52,201
Dewey, remember to
grandparents really love?

41
00:02:54,244 -> 00:02:55,631
Must be changed

42
00:02:55,632 -> 00:02:59,161
Always change
Do it

43
00:02:59,724 -> 00:03:02,042
I will sit up
and teach him

44
00:03:03,079 -> 00:03:05,487
Change it yourself, it smells bad!

45
00:03:08,508 -> 00:03:11,832
No little brood
you dirty more

46
00:03:14,946 -> 00:03:22,258
<i> An estimated 30 thousand young
came to New Orleans for Mardi Gras </ i>

47
00:03:22,259 -> 00:03:24,594
<i> - A police this time ...</ i>

48
00:03:24,595 -> 00:03:27,492
Look at those animals
losing temper

49
00:03:27,493 -> 00:03:32,129
Tearing clothes among themselves,
have no respect for authority

50
00:03:32,130 -> 00:03:34,018
You're right, those
could be us

51
00:03:34,019 -> 00:03:36,937
If we now
'll be there in 5 hours

52
00:03:36,938 -> 00:03:39,780
- How we get there?
- And where we're going to stay?

53
00:03:39,781 -> 00:03:42,015
Friends, want to talk about logistics ...

54
00:03:42,016 -> 00:03:45,772
... When I am offering
48 hours followed by madness?

55
00:03:46,015 -> 00:03:48,938
This could be the best
weekend of our lives

56
00:03:51,855 -> 00:03:53,184
Francis Demons!

57
00:03:53,185 -> 00:03:55,583
How are you going to eat Sushi
of a truck stop?

58
00:03:55,584 -> 00:03:59,892
The cashier said that yellow was cool
besides, my octopus was excellent

59
00:03:59,893 -> 00:04:02,379
Can we not talk about
fish? please

60
00:04:02,539 -> 00:04:04,468
Friends, there is a
war out there

61
00:04:04,469 -> 00:04:08,571
No nudity, looting and police
point with the hose to the crowd

62
00:04:09,168 -> 00:04:11,120
Wet T-Shirts!

63
00:04:15,150 -> 00:04:18,088
Sorry about the food
the refrigerator is broken

64
00:04:18,089 -> 00:04:19,662
What you expected?

65
00:04:19,663 -> 00:04:22,133
This mark is horrendous!

66
00:04:24,304 -> 00:04:27,252
Okay, the pizza fattening

67
00:04:27,253 -> 00:04:32,542
Luck when they arrive with
dogs chase you down the hills

68
00:04:33,205 -> 00:04:37,388
It's great that they can leave
the path without concern

69
00:04:38,753 -> 00:04:39,616
Truth

70
00:04:39,617 -> 00:04:42,950
I am always
thinking about the house

71
00:04:42,951 -> 00:04:46,885
"Will be on the oven?"
"I have left the iron plugged in?"

72
00:04:46,895 -> 00:04:50,553
Once I heard about a fire
by a mouse chewed a wire ...

73
00:04:50,554 -> 00:04:53,381
- Where is my coffee?
- This right here dad

74
00:04:53,382 -> 00:04:55,086
Just as you like

75
00:04:55,526 -> 00:04:58,887
Mama, put it out
not good for children

76
00:04:59,162 -> 00:05:01,156
You think to delay their growth?

77
00:05:01,485 -> 00:05:03,495
You grew up pretty!

78
00:05:05,308 -> 00:05:08,407
Watch as he eats!
Like an animal!

79
00:05:08,408 -> 00:05:11,399
Not like Mr. Pizza
knife and fork

80
00:05:11,400 -> 00:05:13,784
You know dad, since
the last time you came ...

81
00:05:14,115 -> 00:05:16,705
Malcolm, at last
a special class

82
00:05:16,706 -> 00:05:19,214
- What a surprise
- No, no ....

83
00:05:19,215 -> 00:05:23,149
... Is an advanced class,
work hard

84
00:05:23,150 -> 00:05:24,482
Malcolm Tell

85
00:05:24,483 -> 00:05:26,776
Today we finished reading
"The Grapes of Wrath" ...

86
00:05:26,777 -> 00:05:29,115
- And started with advanced algebra
- What is it?

87
00:05:29,116 -> 00:05:32,026
Do you laugh at me?
I do not study algebra ...

88
00:05:32,027 -> 00:05:34,176
.. because I had
go to war at your age ...

89
00:05:34,177 -> 00:05:36,157
What is the use of mathematics
in the war eh?

90
00:05:38,664 -> 00:05:41,774
When you can keep
you only to your family ...

91
00:05:41,775 -> 00:05:45,904
... you have the latest
piece of pizza

92
00:05:47,905 -> 00:05:52,037
Dad, Hal us
kept perfectly

93
00:05:52,038 -> 00:05:54,721
It is not easy when someone
eats all the pizza

94
00:05:54,722 -> 00:05:59,749
Do not even have food at home
for my grandchildren what they call support?

95
00:05:59,750 -> 00:06:01,851
Send to repair
refrigerator

96
00:06:01,852 -> 00:06:03,962
Why would it break again?

97
00:06:03,963 -> 00:06:05,494
How much does a new one?

98
00:06:05,495 -> 00:06:10,420
"700, $ 800?
Give them money for a new one!

99
00:06:10,421 -> 00:06:13,616
in our generation
knew how to save money

100
00:06:13,617 -> 00:06:17,813
What we kept, not
malgastábamos in toys

101
00:06:17,814 -> 00:06:21,719
He wore a piece of wood
and was happy with that

102
00:06:21,720 -> 00:06:24,348
We will not accept your money!

103
00:06:24,349 -> 00:06:26,072
Of course I will!

104
00:06:26,073 -> 00:06:31,221
we love you too much to see
your children grow up ashamed of you

105
00:06:31,222 -> 00:06:33,663
That's what this family!

106
00:06:35,284 -> 00:06:36,714
- Hello?
- Malcolm

107
00:06:36,853 -> 00:06:40,244
Listen, I know what you
Mom gets to you when we are sick

108
00:06:40,245 -> 00:06:41,393
Are you out there?

109
00:06:41,394 -> 00:06:43,705
I think that is changing
the sheets of her bed

110
00:06:43,706 -> 00:06:46,668
- Grandparents are here
- No way!

111
00:06:46,669 -> 00:06:50,413
"Warn me before or heard
digs its claws into the pavement?

112
00:06:50,414 -> 00:06:52,726
I'm not sure, but I
that my grandfather spat

113
00:06:52,727 -> 00:06:57,265
Do not take it personal, they are creatures
primitive with a little heart

114
00:06:57,266 -> 00:06:58,706
yes, but for some reason ...

115
00:06:58,707 -> 00:07:01,356
Malcolm, have
lizard brain

116
00:07:01,357 -> 00:07:05,343
They feel threatened by
anyone with ambition or intelligence

117
00:07:05,344 -> 00:07:07,028
I eat to have teeth

118
00:07:08,268 -> 00:07:10,835
That's always
are on the phone

119
00:07:10,836 -> 00:07:12,505
Grandpa Is it?

120
00:07:12,506 -> 00:07:15,406
Tell him I say it
an evil poison control

121
00:07:15,407 -> 00:07:18,697
- Francis sends greetings
- Is a criminal

122
00:07:18,698 -> 00:07:19,981
He'll also welcomes

123
00:07:20,671 -> 00:07:22,889
No, no way

124
00:07:22,890 -> 00:07:25,330
- Do not accept their money
- Why not?

125
00:07:25,331 -> 00:07:28,627
Why not let them forget
you paid $ 800

126
00:07:28,628 -> 00:07:30,657
To use it to
try to humiliate

127
00:07:30,658 -> 00:07:32,393
Already do that!

128
00:07:32,394 -> 00:07:34,872
Lois, I know what
your parents think of me

129
00:07:35,320 -> 00:07:37,590
We need the fridge!

130
00:07:37,591 -> 00:07:40,665
We can not let the meat
on the porch forever

131
00:07:42,054 -> 00:07:44,282
You will have
let me do this

132
00:07:47,074 -> 00:07:50,027
You're better
we all

133
00:07:59,877 -> 00:08:02,366
We can not do
Dewey's bed

134
00:08:04,461 -> 00:08:05,848
The Reese looks good ..

135
00:08:10,439 -> 00:08:11,886
Thanks

136
00:08:12,889 -> 00:08:16,773
Did you know that makes Ice
round and square?

137
00:08:17,445 -> 00:08:19,764
How expect
people to decide?

138
00:08:19,765 -> 00:08:21,787
It's nice to have something
work at home

139
00:08:21,788 -> 00:08:27,923
If, perhaps in their twisted way this is the
how your parents to show your love

140
00:08:28,393 -> 00:08:30,772
Hey, Victor, "Cool eh?

141
00:08:30,773 -> 00:08:33,983
My colon is swollen
What is cool?

142
00:08:34,641 -> 00:08:38,634
Listen dad, and pay the mortgage
and as we bought the fridge ...

143
00:08:38,635 -> 00:08:40,944
Need
the check as soon as possible

144
00:08:40,945 -> 00:08:42,650
Speaking of which ...

145
00:08:42,651 -> 00:08:46,800
Your mother and I decided that it is not
pay good money to the family ...

146
00:08:46,801 -> 00:08:49,254
... Always ends badly

147
00:08:50,718 -> 00:08:54,747
Pulp! "Who buys
orange juice with pulp!?

148
00:08:59,831 -> 00:09:03,549
How could they do this? "We offer
money and pretend that nothing happened?

149
00:09:03,550 -> 00:09:06,482
I swear I'll kill them, take down
neck like a chicken!

150
00:09:06,483 -> 00:09:08,520
That does not pay the debt Lois

151
00:09:08,521 -> 00:09:12,042
Unless you are the benefit
of life insurance ....

152
00:09:12,043 -> 00:09:13,564
I'm saying!

153
00:09:13,565 -> 00:09:16,356
give back the refrigerator

154
00:09:16,357 -> 00:09:17,840
I can not buy it on sale

155
00:09:17,841 -> 00:09:20,764
- Hal "we're gonna do!?
- What are our options?!

156
00:09:20,765 -> 00:09:24,209
Overtime work for a couple
of weeks to stabilize!

157
00:09:24,210 -> 00:09:27,070
"And who will care for the children!?

158
00:09:27,844 -> 00:09:30,666
So we think ..
the best thing would ...

159
00:09:30,667 -> 00:09:34,454
... if they can stay a while
and watch the kids.

160
00:09:34,455 -> 00:09:38,497
Do not know, should go

161
00:09:38,498 -> 00:09:41,346
I feel much tension

162
00:09:41,685 -> 00:09:44,446
- No!
- Oh, no!

163
00:09:45,695 -> 00:09:48,573
No, there is no tension!
we just ..

164
00:09:48,574 -> 00:09:54,137
We have a busy couple of weeks
and hoped they could stay

165
00:09:54,138 -> 00:09:58,114
Of course! We would
anything for you! We are family!

166
00:09:59,793 -> 00:10:04,366
Dewey, guess, the grandfather of
care for a couple of weeks

167
00:10:30,204 -> 00:10:34,649
- Francis How are you doing?
- I need a doctor

168
00:10:34,650 -> 00:10:37,926
We bring something better ..
Guaranteed!

169
00:10:39,432 -> 00:10:41,253
You do not know what is out there!

170
00:10:41,254 -> 00:10:45,951
There is free beer, and girls
remove your shirt if you give them endorse it!

171
00:10:46,086 -> 00:10:50,170
Is it possible that we found dead
on the road and that is the paradise?

172
00:10:50,171 -> 00:10:52,800
Appreciate die now

173
00:10:52,801 -> 00:10:55,778
I can not believe
you say that Francis!

174
00:10:56,682 -> 00:11:00,321
You are the leader, if not
would not be here for you!

175
00:11:01,789 -> 00:11:06,620
You know what, you're right,
is a party I can do it!

176
00:11:06,621 -> 00:11:07,630
Yes!

177
00:11:07,631 -> 00:11:10,498
- Give me those vouch!
- Yes! go!

178
00:11:11,901 -> 00:11:14,602
Francis, Francis!

179
00:11:20,677 -> 00:11:24,089
Thank god the hotel
have a drain in the hallway!

180
00:11:25,377 -> 00:11:26,619
Back!

181
00:11:28,300 -> 00:11:30,410
Not yet
return your parents?

182
00:11:30,411 -> 00:11:34,262
If you go to work all
time .... not have children

183
00:11:34,544 -> 00:11:37,261
- Hey, I want ice cream
- Do not blame you

184
00:11:37,262 -> 00:11:41,172
Always does the same, it takes you
for ice cream and never invited me!

185
00:11:41,173 -> 00:11:42,646
eh thought of that ...

186
00:11:42,892 -> 00:11:45,991
... I think I see
as the protector of the lineage

187
00:11:46,521 -> 00:11:49,578
... If the future is so bad
and grandfather believed ...

188
00:11:49,579 -> 00:11:54,235
.... Only survive mutant
cockroaches and I ...

189
00:11:54,236 -> 00:11:56,205
... All living
underwater.

190
00:11:56,804 -> 00:11:59,920
Face it, are
support the better.

191
00:12:01,161 -> 00:12:05,101
oh, I'm so full,
I should not ask for another

192
00:12:17,408 -> 00:12:22,919
Are you all right Grandma? if you want
I can take the bag ... or whiskey.

193
00:12:23,120 -> 00:12:26,876
once strangled a guard
border with my own hands

194
00:12:26,877 -> 00:12:28,299
Just wondering

195
00:12:29,272 -> 00:12:31,694
Study on
home school

196
00:12:31,695 -> 00:12:36,026
Always with the books, you
to eye cancer

197
00:12:36,027 -> 00:12:39,206
No, really, I found
Folklore interesting ....

198
00:12:39,207 -> 00:12:43,907
... History, the revolution had
be very hard while growing up

199
00:12:44,808 -> 00:12:46,622
I was ...

200
00:12:47,721 -> 00:12:49,007
Very hard ...

201
00:12:51,392 -> 00:12:54,546
- Take a drink
- Maybe later

202
00:12:58,950 -> 00:13:01,493
Look at mama's boy!

203
00:13:04,130 -> 00:13:06,326
- Will you leave?
- What?

204
00:13:06,327 -> 00:13:09,813
Hey guys,
back and repeat that!

205
00:13:09,814 -> 00:13:11,347
"Grandma you do?

206
00:13:11,456 -> 00:13:14,041
Who is your bodyguard?

207
00:13:14,042 -> 00:13:17,760
No no, okay,
kidding

208
00:13:30,491 -> 00:13:31,695
Grandma ..

209
00:13:32,730 -> 00:13:34,442
... Oh god ...

210
00:13:36,696 -> 00:13:38,936
Why not me
say who did this?

211
00:13:38,937 -> 00:13:41,816
There is no honor
to protect a thug

212
00:13:43,834 -> 00:13:45,831
Okay, is your face ..

213
00:13:46,255 -> 00:13:48,762
Mom .. you ..

214
00:13:51,067 -> 00:13:53,207
Do you like your parents?

215
00:13:53,208 -> 00:13:57,796
No matter what I feel,
I will not be able to change

216
00:13:58,055 -> 00:14:01,196
Do not choose your parents
stay with what you get

217
00:14:01,197 -> 00:14:02,519
I know

218
00:14:06,118 -> 00:14:08,473
However, insurance
can not be changed ...

219
00:14:08,474 -> 00:14:11,865
If they get hard at least
that soon will be ....

220
00:14:12,234 -> 00:14:13,811
"Back home right?

221
00:14:15,147 -> 00:14:18,091
If, what I meant ..

222
00:14:28,286 -> 00:14:30,260
I thought you would go
before me

223
00:14:30,261 -> 00:14:33,021
We both registers
open until midnight ...

224
00:14:33,022 -> 00:14:36,340
What idiot buys a
ball at 11 at night?

225
00:14:36,620 -> 00:14:39,531
- Did you do the brown bag?
- Oh, no, not yet ...

226
00:14:39,532 -> 00:14:43,580
... e been here, you know
I discovered something interesting sights.

227
00:14:44,069 -> 00:14:47,170
Apparently, the cubes
round cool faster ...

228
00:14:47,171 -> 00:14:49,122
... But the pictures last longer

229
00:14:49,123 -> 00:14:51,731
Hal god,
"Could you stop playing!?

230
00:14:52,331 -> 00:14:55,164
That's a rectal thermometer!

231
00:14:56,107 -> 00:14:59,798
- I'll go brush my teeth
- I asked you one thing ...!

232
00:14:59,799 -> 00:15:02,424
"I can not do everything you know?

233
00:15:12,635 -> 00:15:14,725
- Are you upset about something?
- Look ...

234
00:15:14,726 -> 00:15:17,221
I'm exhausted after completing a
double shift, I go to sleep.

235
00:15:17,222 -> 00:15:20,345
Sure, you paréese
annoying cubes

236
00:15:20,346 -> 00:15:23,081
Because I'm tired of
that do not help in the house!

237
00:15:23,082 -> 00:15:25,056
Okay, Lois!

238
00:15:25,057 -> 00:15:27,523
... Is that they have been
a rainy day ...

239
00:15:27,524 -> 00:15:30,056
... But you do not have it get even
what your parents with me!

240
00:15:30,057 -> 00:15:32,453
- You?
- Of course, if ...

241
00:15:32,454 -> 00:15:39,211
.. These angry with them, and you
out on me, is classic!

242
00:15:39,212 -> 00:15:41,708
Am I
taking it out right?

243
00:15:41,709 -> 00:15:45,388
And you only pay attention
to that monstrosity in the kitchen!

244
00:15:45,389 -> 00:15:48,095
I knew it, not you
Like the fridge!

245
00:15:48,096 -> 00:15:50,790
I hate that fridge!

246
00:15:51,168 -> 00:15:53,227
Hate your round handles ...

247
00:15:53,228 -> 00:15:58,236
hatred and cooled butter, and hate
listen to their buzz when I sleep!

248
00:15:58,237 -> 00:16:01,262
- Oh no, you can not hear ..
- Yes, if I can!

249
00:16:01,263 -> 00:16:02,961
No, not the 5100!

250
00:16:02,962 -> 00:16:06,052
That engine has 4 layers
thick, Lois 4 layers!

251
00:16:06,253 -> 00:16:10,820
And cool too!

252
00:16:13,255 -> 00:16:17,240
That is a criticism unfounded
Unfounded and unfair!

253
00:16:17,241 -> 00:16:20,695
... And until you apologize
I will be in the garage

254
00:16:22,615 -> 00:16:25,728
I told you there was tension

255
00:16:31,707 -> 00:16:34,388
Grandma, Grandpa
wants to know if you ...

256
00:16:35,150 -> 00:16:38,860
- Why was that?
- Why not try to defend

257
00:16:38,861 -> 00:16:42,120
- Why you are so weak?
- Not expected to hit me

258
00:16:42,121 -> 00:16:45,869
That's what they expect when
come to your house in the middle of the night!

259
00:16:46,215 -> 00:16:48,652
- Grandmother, enough!
- Come on ...

260
00:16:48,653 -> 00:16:50,515
... Show me the
these fact, we

261
00:16:50,516 -> 00:16:52,172
Grandma, I will not hit you!

262
00:16:52,173 -> 00:16:54,418
a child should never say that

263
00:16:54,419 -> 00:16:57,964
How do you defend yourself when you mess
in a trunk and take you away?

264
00:16:57,965 -> 00:17:02,336
"I'll read anything? Do the slay of
privileged print your brain?

265
00:17:03,591 -> 00:17:06,351
"I'm smart right?
That is what I am!

266
00:17:06,352 -> 00:17:10,430
... And if you bother to take classes
advanced and read good books ...

267
00:17:10,431 -> 00:17:13,175
... Bad luck! because
I will be important ...

268
00:17:13,176 -> 00:17:16,079
... and maybe rich, because
I'm smart right?

269
00:17:16,612 -> 00:17:20,130
So let me
in peace and I'll be fine!

270
00:17:22,256 -> 00:17:24,698
I warned him of the eyes

271
00:17:27,303 -> 00:17:30,908
- What's this about?
- I want to show something

272
00:17:31,592 -> 00:17:38,298
Something for you, skip this
time for many years

273
00:17:38,299 -> 00:17:44,861
... But now that you're older, I
give you something close to my heart.

274
00:17:45,437 -> 00:17:48,680
- Is this real?
- In the great war!

275
00:17:50,241 -> 00:17:53,370
- Is it a real gas mask?
- If a gas mask!

276
00:17:53,371 -> 00:18:00,430
Field glasses, chocolate rations,
get a cute girl with that

277
00:18:02,343 -> 00:18:05,683
That's great grandfather,
are the best!

278
00:18:05,684 -> 00:18:07,827
This is so cool!

279
00:18:07,828 -> 00:18:10,419
- Good heavens!
- That, that!?

280
00:18:10,420 -> 00:18:14,076
It's a loaded grenade!
Do not drop it or die!

281
00:18:14,125 -> 00:18:16,281
- Do not want to die!
- Do not die!

282
00:18:16,282 -> 00:18:22,973
Do not worry, you only have to go back
Put the insurance and everything will be fine

283
00:18:25,853 -> 00:18:28,056
Leave to mourn like a baby!

284
00:18:28,057 -> 00:18:29,224
What happens?

285
00:18:29,225 -> 00:18:32,125
The grandfather gave me a pomegranate
is great, you want to have it?

286
00:18:32,126 -> 00:18:34,646
No, the pomegranate
for you not to

287
00:18:34,647 -> 00:18:38,461
- We have to call the police!
- No, the police, please

288
00:18:38,462 -> 00:18:41,352
- No need to panic
- Of course, if ...

289
00:18:41,353 -> 00:18:44,562
... You gave Reese a grenade
and is a complete idiot

290
00:18:44,563 -> 00:18:47,516
You're right, it should not have it!
Take!

291
00:18:47,517 -> 00:18:48,981
No, you hold it!

292
00:18:48,982 -> 00:18:52,026
I'm sick of this game
now what I want is to leave

293
00:18:52,027 -> 00:18:53,124
No, no!

294
00:19:05,199 -> 00:19:06,602
Hello!

295
00:19:08,132 -> 00:19:10,543
- What was that?
- What was that?

296
00:19:16,536 -> 00:19:18,684
"What happened here!?

297
00:19:18,685 -> 00:19:20,018
We're not sure

298
00:19:20,019 -> 00:19:23,841
The grandfather gave me a big,
was charged, was going to explode

299
00:19:23,842 -> 00:19:25,625
But Malcolm's got
in the refrigerator

300
00:19:25,626 -> 00:19:30,959
"I gave my son a grenade?
Did you bring ammunition to my house?

301
00:19:31,694 -> 00:19:37,781
"What is your problem!?
"They're totally crazy!?

302
00:19:37,782 -> 00:19:40,381
Do not speak to me again
so I hear!

303
00:19:43,725 -> 00:19:49,278
Mama, I just ... I just ..

304
00:19:49,279 -> 00:19:51,934
Well, well,
Take Lois children

305
00:19:52,733 -> 00:19:54,328
- But Hal ...
- Now

306
00:19:54,329 -> 00:19:55,329
We ..

307
00:20:00,648 -> 00:20:02,851
Because we do not sit ...

308
00:20:08,766 -> 00:20:13,975
First of all, no attempt
solve their problems with Lois ...

309
00:20:13,976 -> 00:20:15,506
... Not my thing ...

310
00:20:15,507 -> 00:20:19,123
... And it would be stupid
try to put a price on ...

311
00:20:19,124 -> 00:20:23,724
... Have deep psychological trauma
Lois caused through the years ..

312
00:20:23,725 -> 00:20:28,044
.. But let me calculate,
"U.S. dollars 3mil paréese them right?

313
00:20:28,045 -> 00:20:28,850
What?

314
00:20:28,851 -> 00:20:33,902
Well, that would cover the refrigerator,
collateral damage, credit cards

315
00:20:33,903 -> 00:20:36,205
and would repair the
my car transmission

316
00:20:36,206 -> 00:20:41,265
Why this has just happened,
want to lend you 3mil dollars?

317
00:20:41,266 -> 00:20:46,258
Please, do not like paying
money to the family, so let's be clear

318
00:20:49,011 -> 00:20:54,677
with a call, I can send them to
prison for endangering children

319
00:20:55,713 -> 00:21:00,189
So, what they
ask is not a loan ...

320
00:21:01,226 -> 00:21:02,740
... Is blackmail

321
00:21:04,235 -> 00:21:10,593
It's like your
brother, once again

322
00:21:13,305 -> 00:21:16,629
Let Francis, we have
leave or not arrive on time

323
00:21:16,630 -> 00:21:21,496
I do not care, we came up
Here, I have these beads

324
00:21:21,497 -> 00:21:23,930
I will not go up
get some action!

325
00:21:29,306 -> 00:21:32,124
Now, if you please
I need the room

326
00:21:32,618 -> 00:21:34,631
Okay, I'm fine

327
00:21:36,519 -> 00:21:40,695
