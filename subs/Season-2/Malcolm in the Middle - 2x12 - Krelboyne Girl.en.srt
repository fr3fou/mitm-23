1
00:00:35,300 -> 00:00:35,800
Give me that.

2
00:00:44,001 -> 00:00:45,001
Never learns.

3
00:00:47,002 -> 00:00:50,002
Malcolm 2x12 - The gifted

4
00:00:51,003 -> 00:00:55,003
Subtitles made by matiasmab21
"From fans, for fans":)

5
00:01:25,004 -> 00:01:26,104
Mom, what are you doing?

6
00:01:26,105 -> 00:01:30,105
Malcolm Heaven! Why pay for these underpants you're not using?

7
00:01:30,206 -> 00:01:31,106
Mom ...

8
00:01:31,107 -> 00:01:33,307
Why you're not using your underpants?!

9
00:01:34,408 -> 00:01:35,708
I wear boxers.

10
00:01:35,609 -> 00:01:36,709
Really? ...

11
00:01:37,010 -> 00:01:39,210
Maybe soon you think you need more space ...

12
00:01:39,711 -> 00:01:43,211
... But I'll tell you, you are too optimistic.

13
00:01:45,912 -> 00:01:50,112
Just for once I would not have to suppress
a childhood memory.

14
00:01:57,713 -> 00:02:00,413
Do not you think Dewey is somewhat old to
playing with stuffed animals?

15
00:02:04,314 -> 00:02:07,214
Maybe I should start gradually forget Sunday.

16
00:02:08,215 -> 00:02:10,215
I guess that part of childhood is over.

17
00:02:10,616 -> 00:02:11,616
It's so sad ...

18
00:02:13,017 -> 00:02:14,817
Our little one is growing.

19
00:02:15,718 -> 00:02:16,718
Give me that.

20
00:02:19,719 -> 00:02:20,519
Hey ...

21
00:02:21,120 -> 00:02:22,720
Look at the new girl ...

22
00:02:24,621 -> 00:02:26,721
... Fresh Meat!

23
00:02:27,222 -> 00:02:29,122
You will not have to be afraid.

24
00:02:29,623 -> 00:02:30,723
What are you talking about?

25
00:02:31,424 -> 00:02:33,724
The torture to which you submitted it ended.

26
00:02:34,025 -> 00:02:35,025
What torture?

27
00:02:35,326 -> 00:02:36,326
Vamos!

28
00:02:37,027 -> 00:02:38,527
I broke the tray of food.

29
00:02:40,328 -> 00:02:42,528
When I broke the tips of the pencils.

30
00:02:43,329 -> 00:02:46,229
When you sneeze and no one said "health."

31
00:02:46,330 -> 00:02:47,930
I still feel bad about it.

32
00:02:47,931 -> 00:02:50,831
Now that took your place our pent-up anger is going to go against
it.

33
00:02:50,832 -> 00:02:54,032
You know, the massacres and torture you throughout the school ...

34
00:02:54,733 -> 00:02:56,633
... Why do you want to do that to someone else?

35
00:02:58,034 -> 00:03:00,634
Do not even know, maybe it's nice.

36
00:03:03,835 -> 00:03:05,235
Hi, Malcolm.

37
00:03:05,236 -> 00:03:06,136
-Cindy.

38
00:03:06,137 -> 00:03:08,037
So ... are you new here?

39
00:03:08,138 -> 00:03:09,038
Yes.

40
00:03:10,039 -> 00:03:15,439
My dad wanted to get out of Manhattan, but I think
the real reason is that my mother has remarried and is quite hard ...

41
00:03:15,440 -> 00:03:21,440
... And he thinks a new environment will help the truth is ...
Nothing is the same since my brother died in a boating accident.

42
00:03:23,641 -> 00:03:25,041
Just kidding!

43
00:03:25,942 -> 00:03:26,942
What?

44
00:03:27,343 -> 00:03:30,343
Consiganse ... a room ...

45
00:03:32,744 -> 00:03:33,344
Anyway ...

46
00:03:34,145 -> 00:03:35,045
See you later.

47
00:03:35,246 -> 00:03:36,646
And I'm glad that your brother is okay.

48
00:03:36,847 -> 00:03:38,047
I have no brother.

49
00:03:59,548 -> 00:04:00,348
Cadets ...

50
00:04:00,449 -> 00:04:11,349
Apparently one of you had the compulsion to
to take my stud Baker of 37 'for a walk in a corn field ...

51
00:04:12,350 -> 00:04:17,150
... Can be sure that the head is
to be punished harshly.

52
00:04:17,851 -> 00:04:24,451
I know that I ordered last night excursions painful
by swamp full of leeches ...

53
00:04:24,752 -> 00:04:29,452
... Or the operation to dig ditches and then
filling them ... etc etc etc ... ..

54
00:04:30,253 -> 00:04:32,453
But things have changed ...

55
00:04:33,054 -> 00:04:41,454
Thanks to a criminal conviction on corporal punishment
justice can return and take me out of retirement a. ..

56
00:04:41,855 -> 00:04:43,455
... The old Jicory ...

57
00:04:55,556 -> 00:04:59,456
Are hungry for the meat insolent ...

58
00:05:05,357 -> 00:05:05,957
Hi Dad!

59
00:05:06,358 -> 00:05:07,558
Hi son, what's up?

60
00:05:07,559 -> 00:05:09,459
Do I need a little favor ...

61
00:05:10,160 -> 00:05:11,460
I'll try. What do you need?

62
00:05:11,461 -> 00:05:15,961
An alibi, if you ask just have to say
yesterday we went fishing.

63
00:05:16,362 -> 00:05:16,962
What did you do?

64
00:05:17,063 -> 00:05:19,363
Think you need to specify?

65
00:05:19,564 -> 00:05:20,864
I mean, you have to do this for me.

66
00:05:20,765 -> 00:05:22,565
I will not lie for you!

67
00:05:23,166 -> 00:05:23,766
All right.

68
00:05:23,867 -> 00:05:24,867
I want my payment!

69
00:05:25,268 -> 00:05:26,068
What do I pay?

70
00:05:26,069 -> 00:05:29,769
You know, that for once in a lifetime, I just ask
and you do not need to ask.

71
00:05:30,170 -> 00:05:31,770
That there Francis!

72
00:05:31,771 -> 00:05:32,371
Dad!

73
00:05:32,372 -> 00:05:34,072
No, sorry son, I can not help ...

74
00:05:34,073 -> 00:05:37,073
Have to face the consequences of
you did as an adult.

75
00:05:38,074 -> 00:05:40,974
All I have to say I'm very disappointed in you.

76
00:05:41,975 -> 00:05:42,975
Was Francis?

77
00:05:42,976 -> 00:05:43,676
How are you?

78
00:05:43,677 -> 00:05:47,277
Well ... just ... to get a good grade in history.

79
00:05:47,278 -> 00:05:48,578
Great!

80
00:05:48,979 -> 00:05:53,779
It takes a long time to get into trouble, things
may be starting to change.

81
00:06:05,280 -> 00:06:05,780
So ...

82
00:06:05,981 -> 00:06:07,381
Salts Why so late?

83
00:06:08,082 -> 00:06:09,782
I had to use the computer ...

84
00:06:10,183 -> 00:06:11,383
And you why salt so late?

85
00:06:11,984 -> 00:06:15,784
I liked what you said in class about
search for intelligent life in the universe.

86
00:06:15,885 -> 00:06:17,185
And I waited here just to tell me that?

87
00:06:17,186 -> 00:06:21,686
You know, I was thinking, "Why bother to look for life on
space? ...

88
00:06:21,687 -> 00:06:26,187
If we make contact with aliens probably
end up taking care of your laundry.

89
00:06:27,488 -> 00:06:28,388
Just kidding.

90
00:06:28,689 -> 00:06:31,389
So, how does it feel to have siblings?

91
00:06:31,690 -> 00:06:32,890
I do not know ...

92
00:06:32,891 -> 00:06:34,791
Well, I have to go home, bye.

93
00:06:34,792 -> 00:06:35,792
Goodbye.

94
00:06:51,893 -> 00:06:52,793
What happens?

95
00:06:52,894 -> 00:06:56,294
A new rare girl school, followed me home!

96
00:06:56,295 -> 00:06:56,695
Really?

97
00:06:56,696 -> 00:06:57,696
Is it pretty?

98
00:06:57,697 -> 00:07:00,297
What does that have to do with the boxers?

99
00:07:00,298 -> 00:07:01,798
Mom, please do not!

100
00:07:05,399 -> 00:07:06,199
Hello!

101
00:07:08,400 -> 00:07:09,700
Thanks again for inviting me.

102
00:07:09,701 -> 00:07:10,701
No, nothing!

103
00:07:10,702 -> 00:07:14,402
If my son was not an unpardonable rude I would have invited
itself.

104
00:07:14,903 -> 00:07:16,003
Be good to her

105
00:07:16,204 -> 00:07:18,004
She obviously has no friends at all.

106
00:07:18,505 -> 00:07:21,305
Malcolm, could you ask your girlfriend to pass me the potatoes?

107
00:07:24,006 -> 00:07:27,306
Malcolm, could you thank your girlfriend?

108
00:07:27,707 -> 00:07:30,007
So Cindy, you're the kind of Malcolm.

109
00:07:30,208 -> 00:07:31,008
Yes.

110
00:07:35,109 -> 00:07:38,709
Malcolm ... Could you ask your girlfriend if you want more lentils?

111
00:07:38,710 -> 00:07:39,710
You've spoken!

112
00:07:40,811 -> 00:07:44,711
Thank you, Mr. Chicken, for giving his life for I keep on living.

113
00:07:46,112 -> 00:07:46,712
What are you doing?

114
00:07:47,713 -> 00:07:51,013
If I kill and eat someone, I'd like
thank you.

115
00:07:53,814 -> 00:07:54,214
Hello?

116
00:07:54,315 -> 00:07:57,215
I'm the commander Spangler, academia Marlon.

117
00:07:58,216 -> 00:07:58,616
Yes.

118
00:07:58,617 -> 00:08:04,117
Sorry to bother you but we had an incident to
last week and have done a thorough investigation ...

119
00:08:04,118 -> 00:08:07,818
... And it seems that his son, Francis, is the prime suspect.

120
00:08:07,819 -> 00:08:10,519
Well that's impossible because he was with me
last weekend.

121
00:08:11,220 -> 00:08:12,020
Really?

122
00:08:13,021 -> 00:08:15,221
Yeah, yeah, we went fishing.

123
00:08:15,522 -> 00:08:16,622
Are you sure?

124
00:08:17,023 -> 00:08:20,223
Amazing, do not know how to fight, I have fish as
test ...

125
00:08:20,224 -> 00:08:21,724
Do not you want to send you some?

126
00:08:21,925 -> 00:08:23,725
No, okay.

127
00:08:23,726 -> 00:08:26,026
No, I insist, I have a freezer full!

128
00:08:32,427 -> 00:08:34,827
Well, where is Sunday?

129
00:08:35,428 -> 00:08:36,828
Come on, I can smell it!

130
00:08:37,829 -> 00:08:38,929
Honey ...

131
00:08:40,030 -> 00:08:42,930
Think you just want to take off to Sunday because I'm cruel?

132
00:08:42,931 -> 00:08:43,931
Absolutely.

133
00:08:44,332 -> 00:08:44,932
Dewey ...

134
00:08:45,133 -> 00:08:48,533
The reason why I want you out that Teddy is because
is very dirty ...

135
00:08:48,534 -> 00:08:51,034
It's full of germs and you could get sick.

136
00:08:51,635 -> 00:08:52,935
He would not do that ...

137
00:08:52,936 -> 00:08:53,936
... I want.

138
00:08:54,037 -> 00:08:55,737
Are Germs love.

139
00:08:56,338 -> 00:08:59,738
They are small bugs that bring diseases
and Sunday has many.

140
00:09:00,739 -> 00:09:04,239
When you play they get on your hands and What
if after you touch your eyes?

141
00:09:05,240 -> 00:09:06,140
I tell you what would happen ...

142
00:09:06,341 -> 00:09:08,441
The germs would get into them
and infect ...

143
00:09:08,442 -> 00:09:12,442
And I infirmaries much and end your optic nerve
you and your eyes Cairi rot.

144
00:09:13,943 -> 00:09:14,843
So ...

145
00:09:14,844 -> 00:09:17,144
... If you want to keep Sunday, you can ...

146
00:09:17,845 -> 00:09:21,245
... But if you want to continue with his eyes ... you should give it to me.

147
00:09:24,046 -> 00:09:25,746
You made a wise decision, dear.

148
00:09:27,747 -> 00:09:28,947
To rest.

149
00:09:33,548 -> 00:09:34,248
Hi Malcolm.

150
00:09:34,649 -> 00:09:35,749
I wanted to sit alone ...

151
00:09:36,650 -> 00:09:37,550
Yes, hello ...

152
00:09:37,951 -> 00:09:39,551
Decided that we will be lab partners.

153
00:09:40,452 -> 00:09:42,852
Cintia know ... spend much time with me ...

154
00:09:43,253 -> 00:09:45,853
... Maybe it would be good
look for other friendships.

155
00:09:46,454 -> 00:09:47,854
This seems a good idea ...

156
00:09:48,455 -> 00:09:51,855
... We get along so well that even some among us might arise.

157
00:09:52,256 -> 00:09:53,256
Anything?

158
00:09:53,857 -> 00:09:54,457
Malcolm ...

159
00:09:54,858 -> 00:09:56,058
"Having lunch with your girlfriend?

160
00:09:56,159 -> 00:09:57,659
She is not my girlfriend.

161
00:09:57,860 -> 00:10:00,260
I do not know. I saw how you look ...

162
00:10:01,361 -> 00:10:02,261
Please do not touch me.

163
00:10:02,762 -> 00:10:03,762
Yes, and you know it!

164
00:10:04,963 -> 00:10:06,663
He does not like to be touched.

165
00:10:06,664 -> 00:10:08,264
Well then, I'll do this.

166
00:10:10,665 -> 00:10:14,665
Well now that your body is di
smelly and totally disgusting.

167
00:10:14,666 -> 00:10:17,366
My body is totally gross and smelly.

168
00:10:17,367 -> 00:10:18,367
Something you want to add?

169
00:10:18,368 -> 00:10:19,368
I'm fine.

170
00:10:23,069 -> 00:10:24,169
What was that?

171
00:10:24,170 -> 00:10:25,370
It crabman.

172
00:10:25,671 -> 00:10:28,171
A method of defense of the Israeli army.

173
00:10:28,972 -> 00:10:30,372
Maybe me show you sometime.

174
00:10:30,773 -> 00:10:32,373
If you think you can handle.

175
00:10:47,674 -> 00:10:48,774
What is all this fish?

176
00:10:48,775 -> 00:10:52,175
Nothing, except that I did something stupid.

177
00:10:52,176 -> 00:10:53,176
Are you going to put them in the freezer?

178
00:10:53,477 -> 00:10:55,777
Just for tonight, tomorrow I will send them by mail.

179
00:10:59,278 -> 00:11:00,278
Dewey what are you doing?

180
00:11:00,579 -> 00:11:05,579
Killing germs, I hate germs, scary!

181
00:11:06,380 -> 00:11:07,880
Do not forget the seeds in the oven.

182
00:11:10,581 -> 00:11:11,081
Hello?

183
00:11:11,181 -> 00:11:12,881
You're the best dad ever!

184
00:11:12,882 -> 00:11:15,682
I am not! I am a terrible parent!

185
00:11:15,783 -> 00:11:17,183
Should never have lied to you.

186
00:11:17,184 -> 00:11:20,384
Well, the important thing is that all this happened and I learned the lesson.

187
00:11:20,585 -> 00:11:21,685
What lesson are you talking about?

188
00:11:22,686 -> 00:11:25,086
That you're the best dad ever!

189
00:11:25,087 -> 00:11:27,287
Francis You know, I have no desire to talk about it.

190
00:11:33,188 -> 00:11:36,288
Yeah, yeah .. Col. Spangler, says the father of Francis ...

191
00:11:36,889 -> 00:11:40,389
... I fear ... I lied ...

192
00:11:41,090 -> 00:11:44,390
Francis is responsible for the cadet that destroyed his car.

193
00:11:46,091 -> 00:11:47,191
I see.

194
00:11:49,692 -> 00:11:53,192
Well this puts me in a somewhat compromised.

195
00:11:54,393 -> 00:11:57,393
The culprit is being punished as we speak.

196
00:11:57,694 -> 00:12:00,394
But Francis did, you're punishing the wrong cadet.

197
00:12:00,395 -> 00:12:01,795
Excuse me like that?

198
00:12:02,696 -> 00:12:06,796
In my 30 years in academia I have never beaten
Cadet wrong.

199
00:12:07,297 -> 00:12:09,497
Excuse me, said "whip"?

200
00:12:11,198 -> 00:12:11,898
No.

201
00:12:12,499 -> 00:12:13,299
But sir ...

202
00:12:13,300 -> 00:12:14,900
Consider the case closed.

203
00:12:15,201 -> 00:12:16,601
But sir ...

204
00:12:20,502 -> 00:12:21,902
You should take 5, comrades.

205
00:12:26,603 -> 00:12:28,003
Yes, we are having lunch together.

206
00:12:28,404 -> 00:12:31,004
So what? She likes to sit with me.

207
00:12:32,005 -> 00:12:35,505
For these two are having a conversation
quite interesting.

208
00:12:37,506 -> 00:12:38,706
Did you know that I can read lips?

209
00:12:40,307 -> 00:12:43,807
80% of my doritos are isosceles triangles.

210
00:12:45,508 -> 00:12:47,108
I'm impressed! "I can kiss you?

211
00:12:47,709 -> 00:12:49,709
I was hoping you ask me!

212
00:12:49,710 -> 00:12:51,110
Let me finish my sandwich first.

213
00:12:51,311 -> 00:12:53,211
The wait is sweet agony.

214
00:12:54,912 -> 00:12:56,712
Well, I'm ready.

215
00:12:56,913 -> 00:12:59,713
I do not, I just bite my sandwich!

216
00:13:00,414 -> 00:13:01,814
You're a fool!

217
00:13:15,315 -> 00:13:19,015
Well, if pressed for 10 seconds and you faint.

218
00:13:19,016 -> 00:13:22,616
If I do it for 20 seconds you will die of a brain hemorrhage.

219
00:13:22,617 -> 00:13:23,617
Great.

220
00:13:24,218 -> 00:13:24,818
Okay.

221
00:13:27,019 -> 00:13:28,019
Are you wearing perfume?

222
00:13:28,920 -> 00:13:30,220
It's my shampoo.

223
00:13:30,721 -> 00:13:32,621
Jasmine, do you like?

224
00:13:32,622 -> 00:13:34,022
If it smells good.

225
00:13:34,123 -> 00:13:36,323
They say it removes dandruff, but ...

226
00:13:36,324 -> 00:13:38,224
... I'm not sure, look ...

227
00:13:38,525 -> 00:13:39,725
What do you think?

228
00:13:42,026 -> 00:13:42,726
"Malcolm?

229
00:13:53,527 -> 00:13:56,427
It seems the Cintia and you have created a
real chemistry.

230
00:13:56,428 -> 00:13:57,428
Shut up!

231
00:13:57,929 -> 00:14:00,329
No, you see, is a pun ...

232
00:14:00,330 -> 00:14:01,730
I said shut up!

233
00:14:02,231 -> 00:14:03,631
I'll send it by mail ...

234
00:14:04,032 -> 00:14:05,832
... And other things if you do not mind.

235
00:14:06,733 -> 00:14:09,033
So discover how many words are formed with your
phone number?

236
00:14:09,134 -> 00:14:10,234
In my five.

237
00:14:10,835 -> 00:14:12,835
3 English and 2 in Esperanto.

238
00:14:13,036 -> 00:14:14,136
Just kidding.

239
00:14:14,737 -> 00:14:16,737
If you tell a joke you do not have to say "Just kidding"

240
00:14:16,838 -> 00:14:18,438
Or is it funny or not.

241
00:14:21,339 -> 00:14:23,939
Just because you're cute does not mean you have to be rude.

242
00:14:28,040 -> 00:14:30,040
That was not rude that was ...

243
00:14:30,341 -> 00:14:31,341
What demo ...?

244
00:14:31,542 -> 00:14:33,142
You said it was cute?

245
00:14:33,843 -> 00:14:35,243
Hi Malcolm, What happened?

246
00:14:35,344 -> 00:14:37,744
I just wanted to talk to someone that is bothering me.

247
00:14:37,845 -> 00:14:38,845
What is it?

248
00:14:38,846 -> 00:14:39,646
There is a girl ...

249
00:14:39,647 -> 00:14:40,847
Keep away from her mom!

250
00:14:41,248 -> 00:14:41,948
What?

251
00:14:41,949 -> 00:14:42,949
I'm warning you!

252
00:14:42,950 -> 00:14:44,750
Keep mom away from your love life!

253
00:14:44,751 -> 00:14:46,151
Mom has nothing to do with it.

254
00:14:46,152 -> 00:14:50,752
Trust me, if you have, it will ruin everything. I swear.
What mom tells you, do not.

255
00:14:50,753 -> 00:14:52,053
And neither do the opposite.

256
00:14:52,354 -> 00:14:53,854
The way it works with me is ...

257
00:14:55,555 -> 00:14:56,955
It never really works for me.

258
00:14:58,656 -> 00:15:00,356
I do not think that's a good idea.

259
00:15:00,357 -> 00:15:01,857
I've thought about this for a long time.

260
00:15:03,558 -> 00:15:04,858
Well, whatever.

261
00:15:09,059 -> 00:15:10,359
When you're not going to talk to Dewey?

262
00:15:10,760 -> 00:15:11,960
As I finished with the windows

263
00:15:20,661 -> 00:15:21,461
Hey!

264
00:15:21,862 -> 00:15:22,862
I want a rematch.

265
00:15:22,863 -> 00:15:25,063
The last time the sun was giving me in the eyes, and I could not ...

266
00:15:27,864 -> 00:15:29,064
Hi Malcolm!

267
00:15:29,765 -> 00:15:30,965
What will you do after school?

268
00:15:30,966 -> 00:15:33,966
We are buying a dog and I want you to help me
choose one ...

269
00:15:33,967 -> 00:15:35,967
... My mom wants a Golden Retriever but ...

270
00:15:35,968 -> 00:15:38,368
... I prefer a plain dog labrador ...

271
00:15:38,869 -> 00:15:40,369
... Because everyone has the Golden y. ..

272
00:15:40,370 -> 00:15:42,470
I do not want to be more with you in the lab!

273
00:15:43,771 -> 00:15:44,371
What?

274
00:15:44,372 -> 00:15:45,172
Say ...

275
00:15:45,173 -> 00:15:46,373
It was not my idea ...

276
00:15:46,474 -> 00:15:48,474
The teacher said I have to work with another.

277
00:15:49,975 -> 00:15:50,775
All right.

278
00:16:03,676 -> 00:16:04,776
Hello son.

279
00:16:06,377 -> 00:16:07,477
What are you doing here Dad?

280
00:16:07,578 -> 00:16:08,678
Need to talk.

281
00:16:08,679 -> 00:16:10,679
A journey of eight hours just to talk to me?

282
00:16:10,680 -> 00:16:14,480
I think this is best to talk face to face ...
man to man.

283
00:16:14,681 -> 00:16:15,481
What is it?

284
00:16:15,582 -> 00:16:19,482
Francis, wrecking the car of the commander and not
you were punished.

285
00:16:20,783 -> 00:16:24,083
Another cadet it was ... and not fair.

286
00:16:27,484 -> 00:16:29,684
Did you all this way to tell me that?

287
00:16:29,785 -> 00:16:30,685
Well well ...

288
00:16:31,386 -> 00:16:36,486
... And your mother said you could leave the military school and I
I told him I did not think it was a good idea.

289
00:16:36,487 -> 00:16:37,287
What?

290
00:16:37,288 -> 00:16:40,888
Francis, neither was right and has
to be consequences for that.

291
00:16:40,889 -> 00:16:41,889
Vamos!

292
00:16:41,890 -> 00:16:44,890
Look, if I did this would fallándote as a parent.

293
00:16:44,891 -> 00:16:45,891
There must be another way!

294
00:16:46,092 -> 00:16:48,892
No, no ... I've been thinking about the whole trip.

295
00:16:48,893 -> 00:16:52,493
This is the only right thing to do because I
I was also complicit.

296
00:16:55,194 -> 00:16:57,194
It's all I had to say.

297
00:17:01,495 -> 00:17:04,595
Sounds like you have things to do so I leave here.

298
00:17:04,796 -> 00:17:05,796
Adios.

299
00:17:11,497 -> 00:17:12,497
I love you son.

300
00:17:15,498 -> 00:17:16,498
Have fun.

301
00:17:28,799 -> 00:17:29,999
Dewey, we need to talk.

302
00:17:31,500 -> 00:17:34,400
Baby, when you talked about germs was only
trying to scare you ...

303
00:17:34,401 -> 00:17:35,401
... That was wrong.

304
00:17:36,102 -> 00:17:37,702
But this is not about germs ...

305
00:17:38,003 -> 00:17:39,103
Honey, it's about growing.

306
00:17:39,504 -> 00:17:44,504
The reason I had to get you to Sunday's because
're too old for that teddy bear that is falling apart!

307
00:17:47,105 -> 00:17:48,705
Dewey, you have to calm down!

308
00:17:48,706 -> 00:17:50,706
It is a small insect, never hurt anyone!

309
00:17:51,107 -> 00:17:52,507
It has many germs!

310
00:17:52,608 -> 00:17:53,708
Well, that's enough.

311
00:18:04,509 -> 00:18:05,309
See?

312
00:18:06,310 -> 00:18:07,510
I have met with nothing.

313
00:18:10,111 -> 00:18:13,411
Well ... okay ... then ...

314
00:18:13,412 -> 00:18:15,212
Take off the plastic and go to breakfast.

315
00:18:22,813 -> 00:18:23,513
But anyway ...

316
00:18:24,014 -> 00:18:25,814
Look at him, talking to these idiots!

317
00:18:25,815 -> 00:18:26,915
Who is that?

318
00:18:28,516 -> 00:18:30,116
What am I saying? I do not care ...

319
00:18:30,217 -> 00:18:32,617
Why should I care? There is nothing special about her ...

320
00:18:33,818 -> 00:18:35,918
Why should I bother so much?

321
00:18:38,119 -> 00:18:41,519
If I am a genius, you should find a clever way
out of this.

322
00:18:41,920 -> 00:18:45,720
Why did you throw a brick at the window of my daughter at 2 am?

323
00:18:46,321 -> 00:18:47,021
I do not know ...

324
00:18:47,522 -> 00:18:48,422
Really do not know.

325
00:18:49,623 -> 00:18:52,423
How could you do that? I was seriously scared of Malcolm.

326
00:18:52,424 -> 00:18:53,924
I do not know, sorry!

327
00:18:54,025 -> 00:18:57,225
The good news is that mom will kill me before the end of this.

328
00:18:57,226 -> 00:19:00,526
I moved to the suburbs for my daughter
is attacked at night.

329
00:19:00,527 -> 00:19:02,027
For the love of God!

330
00:19:02,028 -> 00:19:04,428
There has been an attack, just wanted to meet her!

331
00:19:05,429 -> 00:19:06,229
Excuse me?

332
00:19:06,230 -> 00:19:06,830
Mom, no!

333
00:19:06,831 -> 00:19:09,831
Do not worry Malcolm will be punished but not
be afraid.

334
00:19:09,832 -> 00:19:10,432
But ...

335
00:19:10,433 -> 00:19:12,133
Do not you remember when you were their age?

336
00:19:12,334 -> 00:19:14,734
Do all the nonsense that did to their girlfriends?

337
00:19:14,735 -> 00:19:16,035
I'm not your ...

338
00:19:16,036 -> 00:19:17,036
It puberty!

339
00:19:17,337 -> 00:19:20,537
Their bodies go crazy and can not help it!

340
00:19:20,638 -> 00:19:26,538
Starting to be kisses like fools, then excited and as they know
do they give for throwing bricks and stuff.

341
00:19:27,139 -> 00:19:29,539
My oldest son set fire to a dog kennel!

342
00:19:29,940 -> 00:19:31,540
They are idiots at this age!

343
00:19:31,541 -> 00:19:32,941
That's all they do.

344
00:19:32,942 -> 00:19:35,242
If good, it could be ...

345
00:19:35,243 -> 00:19:38,343
... But this kind of behavior is not acceptable.

346
00:19:38,344 -> 00:19:39,844
No, it is not.

347
00:19:39,945 -> 00:19:42,145
But better get used to it because I'm going to say now ...

348
00:19:42,146 -> 00:19:43,746
This is a small plant ...

349
00:19:44,047 -> 00:19:46,447
In the next 3 years all your cells burst ...

350
00:19:47,248 -> 00:19:50,148
It will be something against it, but do not let that affect you.

351
00:19:50,149 -> 00:19:52,249
You'll be happy when you get to college.

352
00:19:52,250 -> 00:19:53,250
Come on.

353
00:19:53,551 -> 00:19:54,851
I'll give the number of glass companies.

354
00:19:54,852 -> 00:19:57,852
We have given a lot of work, it will be treated well.

355
00:20:08,353 -> 00:20:10,853
At least not stripped us to take pictures.

356
00:20:11,454 -> 00:20:12,354
Do not despair ...

357
00:20:19,055 -> 00:20:19,855
Okay.

358
00:20:20,356 -> 00:20:21,156
You know what?

359
00:20:22,157 -> 00:20:23,157
I do not ...

360
00:20:23,858 -> 00:20:24,958
I really like.

361
00:20:25,559 -> 00:20:27,359
I'm willing to say ...

362
00:20:27,560 -> 00:20:29,360
... I really like.

363
00:20:30,061 -> 00:20:31,561
You too me.

364
00:20:31,862 -> 00:20:33,562
Very well then ...

365
00:20:37,263 -> 00:20:38,063
What?

366
00:20:38,364 -> 00:20:40,564
I'm not excited or anything like that, right?

367
00:20:40,565 -> 00:20:42,365
No, me neither.

368
00:20:44,366 -> 00:20:46,466
And my body is not going crazy.

369
00:20:47,067 -> 00:20:48,467
Well.

370
00:20:50,668 -> 00:20:52,468
God! Why I say that?

371
00:20:52,469 -> 00:20:54,069
Malcolm! What are you doing?

372
00:20:54,070 -> 00:20:56,770
Cintia, believe me, I'm trying to kiss ...

373
00:20:56,871 -> 00:21:00,471
... and if you give me a minute
to clear my mind I will be able to kiss you, right?

374
00:21:00,472 -> 00:21:01,472
Excuse me?

375
00:21:01,673 -> 00:21:02,873
Francis said you'd say that ...

376
00:21:02,874 -> 00:21:04,174
And who is this Francis?

377
00:21:04,175 -> 00:21:05,775
Not what you think, is my brother.

378
00:21:05,776 -> 00:21:07,776
Were you going to kiss me thinking about your brother?

379
00:21:07,777 -> 00:21:09,777
No, I was thinking about my mom.

380
00:21:11,378 -> 00:21:13,578
No, I mean ... I thought in your bra.

381
00:21:14,379 -> 00:21:16,679
No, I was thinking about what's in your bra!

382
00:21:17,080 -> 00:21:18,980
Well ... I mean .. what will be there in your bra!

383
00:21:19,981 -> 00:21:21,281
"I can start again?

384
00:21:33,782 -> 00:21:36,282
I wonder if I can convince someone that I fell.
