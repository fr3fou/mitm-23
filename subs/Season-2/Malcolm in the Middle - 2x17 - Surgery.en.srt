1
00:00:02,200 -> 00:00:04,000
Okay, I think that managed to escape.

2
00:00:04,201 -> 00:00:08,401
Just have to tighten the nut here y. .. that's it.

3
00:00:09,402 -> 00:00:11,202
You are now leaving the two hot water taps!

4
00:00:11,803 -> 00:00:12,603
What?

5
00:00:14,004 -> 00:00:15,204
Well not so bad ...

6
00:00:15,205 -> 00:00:17,005
... You're always complaining that there is little hot water.

7
00:00:17,106 -> 00:00:19,606
You should call a professional from time to time.

8
00:00:19,607 -> 00:00:21,707
We charge $ 70 just to come home!

9
00:00:22,108 -> 00:00:26,408
Look, I know that my work is not perfect but I save a lot
money and at least now fixed.

10
00:00:29,009 -> 00:00:31,509
Now if you'll excuse me ... someone is calling.

11
00:00:32,810 -> 00:00:35,510
Malcolm 2x17 - Operation

12
00:00:36,511 -> 00:00:41,511
Subtitles made by matiasmab21
* From fans to fans *

13
00:00:41,512 -> 00:00:46,512
If you want help with send me a mail subs
matias_mab21@hotmail.com or add me to msn.

14
00:01:06,012 -> 00:01:13,512
The tension is raised on the Olympic shaving number 8215
Hal has lost a few crucial seconds with soap, but will mount it with the blade.

15
00:01:15,413 -> 00:01:16,413
This is worth gold!

16
00:01:16,414 -> 00:01:17,914
Hal, boys, breakfast!

17
00:01:18,315 -> 00:01:19,315
Day chops!

18
00:01:35,116 -> 00:01:37,016
Dewey do not panic but there's a spider on your plate!

19
00:01:37,117 -> 00:01:39,617
If Dad ... always spiders in the days of chops.

20
00:01:41,018 -> 00:01:42,918
You know, I do not feel very well.

21
00:01:42,919 -> 00:01:46,719
I could give my Dad chops but that's not going to
the spirit of this day.

22
00:01:47,120 -> 00:01:48,320
Mom my stomach hurts.

23
00:01:48,321 -> 00:01:49,321
Me too!

24
00:01:49,922 -> 00:01:51,722
No kidding. I'm serious!

25
00:01:52,023 -> 00:01:52,723
It hurts!

26
00:01:52,824 -> 00:01:53,824
Reese Shut up!

27
00:01:54,325 -> 00:01:56,825
Mom ..
- I see spots! Mami!

28
00:01:56,826 -> 00:01:58,226
Well enough is enough.

29
00:01:58,727 -> 00:02:02,727
I do not care for that review did not study or work they did,
going to go to school.

30
00:02:02,928 -> 00:02:04,128
You know, now that you mention it ...

31
00:02:04,129 -> 00:02:05,229
Everyone will go!

32
00:02:08,430 -> 00:02:09,530
Lord, what are you doing?

33
00:02:09,731 -> 00:02:11,231
Why is going to take our TV?

34
00:02:11,232 -> 00:02:13,032
It's for your own good cadet.

35
00:02:13,033 -> 00:02:15,733
But that's the only thing that makes this place endure.

36
00:02:15,734 -> 00:02:18,734
Television rots the mind cadet.

37
00:02:18,735 -> 00:02:26,235
How can concentrate on their studies and enhance their character if
your brain is full of "sun, the beach vigiliantes?

38
00:02:26,236 -> 00:02:28,936
Now have time for more productive use.

39
00:02:29,037 -> 00:02:32,937
Write letters, I'm sure your recipients will thank you.

40
00:02:34,038 -> 00:02:35,838
Well, that's ridiculous!

41
00:02:36,239 -> 00:02:37,539
I say we should do something!

42
00:02:37,640 -> 00:02:38,440
You're right!

43
00:02:38,441 -> 00:02:44,441
Spangler can not make arbitrary decisions about our lives.
He can not tell us where to go and what to do!

44
00:02:45,342 -> 00:02:46,942
One moment, if you can.

45
00:02:47,243 -> 00:02:50,043
Francis Face it, we are prisoners without rights.

46
00:02:50,044 -> 00:02:51,644
Well, then we are helpless.

47
00:02:52,145 -> 00:02:54,245
But even the defenseless have options!

48
00:02:55,046 -> 00:03:00,046
History is full of people supposedly helpless achieved
oppose their oppressors.

49
00:03:00,347 -> 00:03:01,347
What do you mean?

50
00:03:01,448 -> 00:03:02,748
In civil disobedience!

51
00:03:03,349 -> 00:03:05,349
.. Como a hunger strike!

52
00:03:05,550 -> 00:03:06,450
We can do that!

53
00:03:06,751 -> 00:03:10,351
Will not want to starve the children in their care.
Sure it works!

54
00:03:10,552 -> 00:03:11,352
I do not know.

55
00:03:11,453 -> 00:03:12,853
Is not that a bit drastic?

56
00:03:12,854 -> 00:03:14,054
Should we start after dinner?

57
00:03:14,055 -> 00:03:14,755
What do we have?

58
00:03:14,756 -> 00:03:15,756
Meatloaf.

59
00:03:15,857 -> 00:03:17,157
The strike begins now!

60
00:03:20,558 -> 00:03:22,258
Malcolm, why you walk like that?

61
00:03:22,359 -> 00:03:23,859
I still hurts here.

62
00:03:23,860 -> 00:03:25,260
But this is the weekend.

63
00:03:30,561 -> 00:03:32,261
Okay, everyone get on the car!

64
00:03:32,262 -> 00:03:33,662
We go to the hospital!

65
00:03:37,463 -> 00:03:38,063
Mom ...

66
00:03:38,264 -> 00:03:39,864
Why is this man put a bulb in the ...?

67
00:03:39,865 -> 00:03:40,565
Dewey!

68
00:03:40,566 -> 00:03:41,566
Stay away from there.

69
00:03:43,267 -> 00:03:44,167
Dad you okay?

70
00:03:44,168 -> 00:03:44,868
I'm fine, son.

71
00:03:44,869 -> 00:03:47,069
I just do not really like hospitals.

72
00:03:47,670 -> 00:03:52,570
They can outfit with flowers and pictures but let's face,
this place is a butcher!

73
00:03:52,571 -> 00:03:53,571
Hal!

74
00:03:54,272 -> 00:03:55,572
Are already testing.

75
00:03:55,573 -> 00:04:01,973
White blood cells are at 12.2 and those pricks in the side
I am afraid it is appendicitis.

76
00:04:02,274 -> 00:04:06,274
Will remain under observation tonight and probably tomorrow
it will operate.

77
00:04:06,475 -> 00:04:07,675
Will I be trading?

78
00:04:07,676 -> 00:04:09,376
You do not have to worry.

79
00:04:09,377 -> 00:04:11,477
Not even going to be even a scar.

80
00:04:12,078 -> 00:04:14,878
If I sign these forms, you will enter.

81
00:04:15,479 -> 00:04:16,979
Are you going to open the stomach?

82
00:04:17,180 -> 00:04:18,380
As a trout!

83
00:04:18,381 -> 00:04:20,681
Do not worry you will not feel anything. You'll be
unconscious.

84
00:04:20,882 -> 00:04:21,882
Not exactly.

85
00:04:21,883 -> 00:04:30,883
I saw on TV that guy who woke up while
it was operated and what they were doing but I could not scream because he was paralyzed

86
00:04:31,484 -> 00:04:33,584
Reese for the love of God, stop talking!

87
00:04:33,985 -> 00:04:34,285
Mom ...

88
00:04:34,286 -> 00:04:35,586
Honey, do not worry.

89
00:04:35,887 -> 00:04:40,587
You'll have your own TV, many people pediente you.
You'll be better than at home.

90
00:04:43,988 -> 00:04:45,688
Why am I in the field of children?

91
00:04:45,689 -> 00:04:48,489
I'm sorry honey but you're 6 months younger to have your own room.

92
00:04:48,790 -> 00:04:51,690
I heard that if you behave yourself you will drink apple juice.

93
00:04:53,991 -> 00:04:56,491
Dad want to wait in the car?

94
00:04:57,292 -> 00:04:58,692
No, I'm fine.

95
00:04:59,293 -> 00:05:00,293
I'm fine.

96
00:05:00,694 -> 00:05:01,794
I'm on a beach.

97
00:05:02,595 -> 00:05:07,395
I see the sand ... surf ... there are no bubbles.

98
00:05:07,396 -> 00:05:10,896
There's this horrible plague and penetrating antiseptic hospital ...!

99
00:05:10,897 -> 00:05:11,597
Hal!

100
00:05:11,698 -> 00:05:12,598
Coming.

101
00:05:13,099 -> 00:05:15,599
Take care of your father at home, you'll be fine.

102
00:05:20,400 -> 00:05:21,600
Get well son!

103
00:05:23,101 -> 00:05:24,301
Reese, embrace your brother.

104
00:05:24,502 -> 00:05:25,202
... Mom!

105
00:05:25,203 -> 00:05:26,203
Do it!

106
00:05:29,004 -> 00:05:31,704
If you tell someone to hug you I'll send you back here!

107
00:05:33,605 -> 00:05:34,305
Adios!

108
00:05:36,306 -> 00:05:38,006
Why forced him to hug me?

109
00:05:40,207 -> 00:05:41,007
Wait!

110
00:05:41,008 -> 00:05:42,508
Why did you hug me?!

111
00:05:45,209 -> 00:05:46,309
How quiet is here without Malcolm.

112
00:05:46,910 -> 00:05:47,510
Die?

113
00:05:48,311 -> 00:05:49,011
On a chop.

114
00:05:49,012 -> 00:05:50,012
It's mine!

115
00:05:52,413 -> 00:05:53,513
Come, I'm full.

116
00:05:53,514 -> 00:05:54,514
Me too.

117
00:05:54,515 -> 00:05:55,515
And me too.

118
00:05:56,016 -> 00:05:58,016
I was waiting for someone to fight for it.

119
00:06:00,217 -> 00:06:01,717
Can we play "March and Conquer"?

120
00:06:01,818 -> 00:06:03,118
This game is not fun!

121
00:06:03,219 -> 00:06:05,519
Malcolm always crushed in 5 minutes.

122
00:06:06,420 -> 00:06:07,520
Yes! Can we?

123
00:06:08,521 -> 00:06:10,021
I do not know ...

124
00:06:10,022 -> 00:06:11,022
Please.

125
00:06:11,323 -> 00:06:13,423
We have to be 3 at least to play.

126
00:06:15,224 -> 00:06:16,124
All right.

127
00:06:17,725 -> 00:06:22,625
Very good Lois, see how you defend the black sea without matches and
the tartanelos.

128
00:06:22,626 -> 00:06:24,926
Yeah, yeah .. just wait.

129
00:06:25,527 -> 00:06:27,627
An hour and we're still playing!

130
00:06:27,728 -> 00:06:29,628
Usually I run out before you.

131
00:06:30,929 -> 00:06:31,729
Guess what ...

132
00:06:31,830 -> 00:06:33,730
We are like the family of the box.

133
00:06:34,031 -> 00:06:35,031
If ...

134
00:06:35,432 -> 00:06:36,532
"I can be the girl?

135
00:06:36,633 -> 00:06:38,033
Not while I send child.

136
00:06:45,134 -> 00:06:46,334
Want to play the fish?

137
00:06:46,535 -> 00:06:50,335
No, not want to play for 5 minutes.

138
00:06:50,736 -> 00:06:53,336
I did not want to play in an hour.

139
00:06:53,537 -> 00:06:55,637
Do not want to play!

140
00:06:57,938 -> 00:06:59,638
Do you have a 5?

141
00:07:01,039 -> 00:07:03,039
And this is our inflamed appendix.

142
00:07:03,440 -> 00:07:08,040
The patient arrived today complaining of abdominal pain
the right quadrant.

143
00:07:09,241 -> 00:07:12,241
Can we start putting serum, Catherine?

144
00:07:12,442 -> 00:07:14,442
God! Not me again ...

145
00:07:14,743 -> 00:07:15,543
Please!

146
00:07:15,844 -> 00:07:18,844
Come out all right this time Catherine, accidents happen.

147
00:07:18,845 -> 00:07:19,745
Can not someone else to do ..?

148
00:07:19,746 -> 00:07:21,146
Helmot going to hold.

149
00:07:30,347 -> 00:07:36,747
If you feel pain, you bite the hand with all the strength you have,
he does not care.

150
00:07:42,648 -> 00:07:44,648
How long we do not eat?

151
00:07:44,949 -> 00:07:47,349
33 hours and 12 minutes.

152
00:07:47,750 -> 00:07:50,050
God and are serving dinner.

153
00:07:50,851 -> 00:07:51,851
Firm!

154
00:07:55,352 -> 00:07:58,552
I found only in the last meals.

155
00:08:00,453 -> 00:08:03,953
Are we on a diet? Not a football season.

156
00:08:03,954 -> 00:08:05,754
We are on a hunger strike sir.

157
00:08:05,855 -> 00:08:08,055
We will not eat until we return the TV.

158
00:08:10,156 -> 00:08:12,356
Passive resistance.

159
00:08:12,557 -> 00:08:15,557
This is the last resort of cowards.

160
00:08:15,958 -> 00:08:17,058
What about the Gandinga?

161
00:08:17,059 -> 00:08:18,059
A hen.

162
00:08:19,060 -> 00:08:23,360
This is a fight, sir, we will not surrender until
justice.

163
00:08:23,361 -> 00:08:25,261
Well, let's see if I understand.

164
00:08:25,262 -> 00:08:28,462
I'm going to keep eating and you do not.

165
00:08:30,563 -> 00:08:32,463
I already feel the pressure.

166
00:08:35,364 -> 00:08:36,764
Stop It Now

167
00:09:10,465 -> 00:09:11,065
Let Mom!

168
00:09:11,366 -> 00:09:15,766
Well, you can do this the easy way and surrender with dignity
... Or I can destroy you.

169
00:09:16,067 -> 00:09:19,767
Do not forget that I have yet to Antarctica and from there to New Zealand.

170
00:09:19,768 -> 00:09:20,768
You have nothing.

171
00:09:20,769 -> 00:09:23,769
If I can not get a 3, the world is mine.

172
00:09:23,770 -> 00:09:24,770
Yes mama!

173
00:09:24,771 -> 00:09:26,671
three three three ...

174
00:09:28,372 -> 00:09:32,072
I'm sorry honey, you worked hard for a moment I thought you were a. ..

175
00:09:32,073 -> 00:09:33,073
Revenge!

176
00:09:33,674 -> 00:09:34,574
All right!

177
00:09:34,875 -> 00:09:35,575
Hal, are over 12.

178
00:09:35,576 -> 00:09:36,576
Revenge!

179
00:09:38,777 -> 00:09:39,977
Put the board.

180
00:09:40,178 -> 00:09:40,978
Coming.

181
00:09:43,679 -> 00:09:44,679
Here it is.

182
00:09:45,980 -> 00:09:46,480
What?

183
00:09:46,481 -> 00:09:49,981
Just stay quiet, you're in good hands.

184
00:09:52,082 -> 00:09:56,182
So your head does not move and Mr. laser can do its job.

185
00:10:19,983 -> 00:10:21,383
I'm sure it was not too bad.

186
00:10:21,484 -> 00:10:23,984
I did use a potty even though she could walk.

187
00:10:23,985 -> 00:10:26,185
The lights at 7 so I can not read.

188
00:10:26,286 -> 00:10:29,386
And last night a man I put a cage in the head!

189
00:10:29,387 -> 00:10:30,987
I would operate on the brain!

190
00:10:31,888 -> 00:10:32,788
A slump.

191
00:10:33,089 -> 00:10:35,489
Honey, surely it was just a nightmare.

192
00:10:35,490 -> 00:10:37,490
In addition, I feel much better now.

193
00:10:37,491 -> 00:10:38,891
I do not need an operation.

194
00:10:38,892 -> 00:10:41,092
Okay scare all operations.

195
00:10:41,393 -> 00:10:43,593
Believe me, this is going to end before they know it.

196
00:10:43,894 -> 00:10:48,894
Between the smell of sickness and not many waffles
I feel great.

197
00:10:48,895 -> 00:10:49,895
What Waffles?

198
00:10:49,896 -> 00:10:50,896
You missed!

199
00:10:51,097 -> 00:10:52,297
We went to breakfast at Pete's

200
00:10:52,298 -> 00:10:53,798
We're never going to breakfast.

201
00:10:53,899 -> 00:10:57,799
Well, we stayed up late playing "Run and Conquest" and your mother
was too tired to cook.

202
00:10:58,000 -> 00:10:59,900
Did you play a 'march and conquest "without me?

203
00:11:00,301 -> 00:11:04,001
Malcolm you did not miss anything, these guys are
a band of bread eaten.

204
00:11:04,002 -> 00:11:05,002
"Bread eaten?

205
00:11:05,203 -> 00:11:07,503
I had the meridian for 3 hours!

206
00:11:07,904 -> 00:11:12,204
Well, let's bring the boys home and then your dad and I
back in time to your operation, right?.

207
00:11:15,905 -> 00:11:16,505
Dewey ...

208
00:11:16,806 -> 00:11:18,206
You're wearing my shirt!

209
00:11:18,207 -> 00:11:19,207
Really?

210
00:11:27,208 -> 00:11:29,108
I'm so hungry!

211
00:11:30,109 -> 00:11:31,709
I think we should leave now.

212
00:11:31,910 -> 00:11:32,710
Guys ...

213
00:11:34,011 -> 00:11:37,111
This hunger strike will only work if we stick together.

214
00:11:37,612 -> 00:11:38,712
We can do it!

215
00:11:38,813 -> 00:11:40,113
Our stomachs were bridged!

216
00:11:40,514 -> 00:11:41,814
The hardest part is over!

217
00:11:42,715 -> 00:11:44,415
Good morning cadets.

218
00:11:45,916 -> 00:11:52,916
I have to say it's refreshing to see a struggling young
value for what they believe.

219
00:11:53,717 -> 00:12:04,517
Two whole days, an impressive show of civil disobedience this is the kind
stomach strength that can only be rewarded with a large tortilla.

220
00:12:09,118 -> 00:12:11,118
Tempt us with food will not work sir.

221
00:12:11,119 -> 00:12:12,119
Of course not.

222
00:12:12,120 -> 00:12:15,120
These delicious eggs and other ingredients are for me.

223
00:12:15,721 -> 00:12:16,921
Now, this is my dilemma ...

224
00:12:17,422 -> 00:12:19,822
What am I going to put put my tortilla?

225
00:12:19,923 -> 00:12:22,823
Black forest ham, cheese import ...

226
00:12:23,624 -> 00:12:24,824
... Or some wild mushrooms.

227
00:12:25,625 -> 00:12:26,825
"Wild?

228
00:12:27,626 -> 00:12:29,826
What the hell ..? Give me everything!

229
00:12:32,427 -> 00:12:34,327
There is our comrade down.

230
00:12:34,628 -> 00:12:36,328
I love the room 24!

231
00:12:37,529 -> 00:12:41,929
Your appendix ... when ... you ... take it away ...?

232
00:12:42,330 -> 00:12:46,130
Tonight but I do not know ... I feel better may not need
this operation.

233
00:12:47,131 -> 00:12:49,831
What do you mean?! Of course you need the operation!

234
00:12:49,832 -> 00:12:50,332
Pe ...

235
00:12:50,333 -> 00:12:52,933
Do not you understand? It's a goldmine!

236
00:12:53,134 -> 00:12:56,234
Take advantage of the situation while it lasts!

237
00:12:56,735 -> 00:12:58,435
With angina I had got this watch!

238
00:12:58,736 -> 00:13:01,736
And my testicle Strap gave me a weekend in "Disneyland"

239
00:13:02,437 -> 00:13:10,737
I am ... a step .. .. to get a "Range Rover"

240
00:13:12,138 -> 00:13:14,138
Well you have 2 hours and then have to return to the hospital.

241
00:13:14,239 -> 00:13:15,839
Do you mind eat leftovers?

242
00:13:16,040 -> 00:13:19,040
Prefer is up to you but it would be a piece of cake, right?

243
00:13:19,441 -> 00:13:20,141
What do you mean?

244
00:13:20,442 -> 00:13:21,542
"March and conquer"

245
00:13:21,943 -> 00:13:24,243
You called me a piece of cake, not deny it!

246
00:13:24,444 -> 00:13:25,944
Come on baby, crush you.

247
00:13:25,945 -> 00:13:31,545
That's because you got lucky with the dice and did not have the responsibility to protect
to Brazil and I would not call it "crush"

248
00:13:31,646 -> 00:13:32,846
What do you call?

249
00:13:33,347 -> 00:13:34,247
"Defeat?

250
00:13:35,448 -> 00:13:36,148
"Raze?

251
00:13:38,149 -> 00:13:39,249
"Annihilate?

252
00:13:41,950 -> 00:13:43,450
Bring the board.

253
00:13:45,851 -> 00:13:46,951
How are you tiger?

254
00:13:47,852 -> 00:13:49,952
I want to take note of the patient treatment.

255
00:13:50,053 -> 00:13:52,753
Dr Harrison glad to see me, wanted to talk to you ...

256
00:13:52,954 -> 00:13:59,454
I feel much better, I have no fever since 6 hours I think
my first blood tests were not accurate.

257
00:13:59,855 -> 00:14:02,255
This is what we call "a hysterical patient"

258
00:14:02,556 -> 00:14:07,756
I'm not hysterical, I just think it would be a good idea I have another test
decirdir blood before the body open up!

259
00:14:07,757 -> 00:14:11,257
Well that's a great idea, really great.

260
00:14:12,158 -> 00:14:13,258
See you later.

261
00:14:15,159 -> 00:14:18,859
What's wrong with you? The labs make mistakes!

262
00:14:19,360 -> 00:14:20,860
Escuchenmee!

263
00:14:21,861 -> 00:14:23,861
Declare war on the country BLUE!

264
00:14:24,362 -> 00:14:27,362
Reese, you attack me Why me? Your father is checked!

265
00:14:27,663 -> 00:14:31,363
What do you mean Lois? What the boys and I formed a union
secret against you?

266
00:14:32,564 -> 00:14:35,864
Hal, what you use to communicate in secret is my foot.

267
00:14:40,665 -> 00:14:42,365
I can not take it anymore.

268
00:14:43,266 -> 00:14:45,566
If not how soon I'm going to faint.

269
00:14:46,067 -> 00:14:47,167
Not worth it.

270
00:14:47,768 -> 00:14:48,968
I agree.

271
00:14:50,169 -> 00:14:51,469
So who are you?

272
00:14:51,870 -> 00:14:53,070
Your roommate.

273
00:14:53,971 -> 00:14:54,471
If ...

274
00:14:55,372 -> 00:14:57,472
"After the Hawaiian party we ski?

275
00:14:57,473 -> 00:14:58,473
What?

276
00:14:58,874 -> 00:15:01,974
Phil wakes up, you're saying estupideceses.

277
00:15:02,475 -> 00:15:05,975
How are we going to have a Hawaiian party trapped in a submarine?

278
00:15:06,276 -> 00:15:07,176
Wait ...

279
00:15:07,277 -> 00:15:08,177
... I hear footsteps.

280
00:15:08,678 -> 00:15:11,078
Come on guys, we're doing well.

281
00:15:11,079 -> 00:15:15,379
I think we're on the right track, let a little and the commander ...

282
00:15:18,080 -> 00:15:18,680
"Spangler?

283
00:15:18,681 -> 00:15:20,281
Yes .. Spangler.

284
00:15:20,682 -> 00:15:24,282
Spangler commander will have to accept our demands.

285
00:15:24,983 -> 00:15:25,983
Francis ...

286
00:15:30,584 -> 00:15:31,984
It's time to talk.

287
00:15:32,785 -> 00:15:34,785
Sorry gentlemen please.

288
00:15:50,686 -> 00:15:51,786
Take your time.

289
00:15:54,687 -> 00:15:55,487
Yes!

290
00:15:55,788 -> 00:15:56,988
Nows the islands are mine!

291
00:15:56,989 -> 00:15:57,989
Let me see those dice.

292
00:15:58,190 -> 00:16:00,490
Are you accusing me of cheating?

293
00:16:00,491 -> 00:16:01,491
That ridiculous!

294
00:16:07,692 -> 00:16:09,092
It's the pizza delivery guy.

295
00:16:10,293 -> 00:16:11,093
Why do not you open?

296
00:16:12,694 -> 00:16:17,294
"For my artillery disappears mysteriously as
when I went for a glass of water?

297
00:16:17,595 -> 00:16:21,295
Or when I went to the bathroom and your tanks materialized on my border?

298
00:16:21,896 -> 00:16:23,296
I do not understand.

299
00:16:27,897 -> 00:16:28,797
Sign!

300
00:16:30,298 -> 00:16:31,498
"Closed"

301
00:16:33,999 -> 00:16:34,699
Try out the window!

302
00:16:35,300 -> 00:16:36,100
What?!

303
00:16:36,701 -> 00:16:39,501
Do not you ever share a pizza? Enter through the window!

304
00:16:41,502 -> 00:16:42,502
Also it is closed!

305
00:16:48,803 -> 00:16:50,403
Well, thanks then.

306
00:16:58,104 -> 00:17:00,104
Take, drink this.

307
00:17:00,105 -> 00:17:01,105
What is this?

308
00:17:01,706 -> 00:17:04,506
It is a sedative, the operation went ahead.

309
00:17:04,807 -> 00:17:05,807
What do you refieron that came forward?

310
00:17:05,808 -> 00:17:07,508
Even my parents are here!

311
00:17:08,509 -> 00:17:10,109
Sure they notify.

312
00:17:10,410 -> 00:17:13,210
Look, I think taking this until I do another test.

313
00:17:14,311 -> 00:17:15,411
Take the pills.

314
00:17:15,412 -> 00:17:17,412
No, I do not ...

315
00:17:20,613 -> 00:17:23,913
I know you're scared, and that is normal for a child.

316
00:17:25,014 -> 00:17:31,914
But now you have to leave to be responsible adults.
Just relax until the pills take effect.

317
00:17:34,515 -> 00:17:35,715
Good boy.

318
00:17:56,116 -> 00:17:57,516
Reese's your turn.

319
00:17:58,117 -> 00:17:59,317
What are you doing?

320
00:17:59,318 -> 00:18:00,318
Do not Know!

321
00:18:00,619 -> 00:18:01,919
I have hunger.

322
00:18:01,920 -> 00:18:04,020
Reese, if you attack me, I annihilate.

323
00:18:04,021 -> 00:18:05,721
If not attacking, you annihilate.

324
00:18:05,722 -> 00:18:09,522
Just do not want to play anymore, I hate this game!

325
00:18:09,523 -> 00:18:10,823
Never was so horrible!

326
00:18:11,224 -> 00:18:13,324
Even when we crushed Malcolm!

327
00:18:15,425 -> 00:18:16,325
You're right.

328
00:18:17,126 -> 00:18:18,526
Look what we've become.

329
00:18:19,027 -> 00:18:22,827
Without humbling Malcolm on our worst instincts.

330
00:18:24,228 -> 00:18:25,428
I feel sorry for us.

331
00:18:27,329 -> 00:18:28,429
So you give up?

332
00:18:29,030 -> 00:18:30,430
Let him and Lois.

333
00:18:31,631 -> 00:18:32,431
You're right.

334
00:18:32,732 -> 00:18:34,532
Reese, do the honors.

335
00:18:36,933 -> 00:18:40,133
Well, Who wants to go see burn the damn game?

336
00:18:40,134 -> 00:18:41,134
Siii!

337
00:18:42,135 -> 00:18:46,135
Cadet I have to admit I thought it would give up much earlier.

338
00:18:46,536 -> 00:18:53,136
But instead have shown their willingness, good teamwork and
the power to continue, well done.

339
00:18:53,937 -> 00:18:54,537
What?

340
00:18:55,438 -> 00:18:56,138
The strike.

341
00:18:56,339 -> 00:18:57,839
Sure, sure strike.

342
00:18:58,140 -> 00:19:06,840
Well that's good because we were going to do that ..
 thing until we get ...

343
00:19:07,041 -> 00:19:08,241
... Well you know.

344
00:19:10,642 -> 00:19:12,642
Yes, I think I know.

345
00:19:13,643 -> 00:19:15,843
Are we talking about my treasure?

346
00:19:17,744 -> 00:19:18,544
We did it!

347
00:19:18,545 -> 00:19:20,145
The strike is over, we won!

348
00:19:20,146 -> 00:19:22,146
Siii!

349
00:19:22,647 -> 00:19:25,047
We got the magic hat!

350
00:19:26,448 -> 00:19:27,648
What happened to television?

351
00:19:34,249 -> 00:19:35,649
Here's your blood friend.

352
00:19:35,850 -> 00:19:37,650
Thanks, here is my urine.

353
00:19:37,951 -> 00:19:39,351
Lucky in drug test.

354
00:19:39,552 -> 00:19:40,552
Although I'd need help.

355
00:19:43,853 -> 00:19:44,853
I knew it!

356
00:19:46,554 -> 00:19:49,754
Hi, I was looking for.

357
00:19:49,855 -> 00:19:50,955
I have some good news.

358
00:19:50,956 -> 00:19:54,956
You see, I made me another blood test and shows that do not need a
operation because ...

359
00:19:55,157 -> 00:19:58,457
... If the levels return to normal signifcant is not appendicitis.

360
00:19:58,558 -> 00:20:01,458
Sure it's an infection or flu.

361
00:20:01,859 -> 00:20:03,259
Yes, small.

362
00:20:07,160 -> 00:20:10,160
I have to ... talk to Dr Harrison.

363
00:20:10,261 -> 00:20:11,661
Counting backwards from 100.

364
00:20:13,162 -> 00:20:17,662
Hey champ, you will we get the appendix in the blink of an eye.

365
00:20:18,563 -> 00:20:20,163
Well, scalpel.

366
00:20:22,164 -> 00:20:23,164
Wait a minute.

367
00:20:25,365 -> 00:20:32,465
"I do not operate, 16:47 platelet hyh 310" these are the results
a blood test.

368
00:20:32,966 -> 00:20:34,466
White blood cells 8.4

369
00:20:34,467 -> 00:20:35,467
Is it right?

370
00:20:36,568 -> 00:20:38,168
Let me give you more anesthetic.

371
00:20:38,469 -> 00:20:40,769
Maybe we should do another blood test.

372
00:20:42,270 -> 00:20:44,970
Spangler was right, we do not need television.

373
00:20:45,371 -> 00:20:46,471
This is nice.

374
00:20:46,872 -> 00:20:48,472
There is fresh air.

375
00:20:48,673 -> 00:20:50,073
Some exercise.

376
00:20:51,174 -> 00:20:52,474
Nice shot!

377
00:20:52,575 -> 00:20:53,475
Thanks.

378
00:20:53,876 -> 00:20:55,476
I think that if magic.

379
00:20:58,277 -> 00:20:59,477
Is not Francis?

380
00:21:01,178 -> 00:21:02,878
Do not forget to plug the holes.

381
00:21:05,479 -> 00:21:08,679
Nothing better than two days in the hospital to assess your home.

382
00:21:08,680 -> 00:21:09,180
Give me that!

383
00:21:09,181 -> 00:21:10,181
My God!

384
00:21:10,882 -> 00:21:12,782
Look to the hospital bill.

385
00:21:12,983 -> 00:21:15,583
I can not imagine what it would cost if they had operated.

386
00:21:16,184 -> 00:21:17,684
I guess vacation goodbye.

387
00:21:18,185 -> 00:21:20,885
What we have to pay that although he was faking?

388
00:21:20,886 -> 00:21:24,386
I was not faking, I was the one who realized that they are wrong, remember?

389
00:21:24,687 -> 00:21:27,587
Well, if you're so smart why do not you find it before?

390
00:21:28,588 -> 00:21:30,588
Well son, Will you answer that?

391
00:21:32,489 -> 00:21:35,589
Nothing like 10 seconds at home to assess the hospital.

392
00:21:37,590 -> 00:21:44,590
