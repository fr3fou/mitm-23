1
00:00:05,800 -> 00:00:07,100
These are the house rules.

2
00:00:07,301 -> 00:00:09,701
You can not start with the second course, until you're done with the first ...

3
00:00:09,902 -> 00:00:14,002
... But when the holder leaves the perimeter of your plate ...
Anything goes.

4
00:00:37,003 -> 00:00:37,603
It's mine!

5
00:00:38,004 -> 00:00:40,604
Malcolm 2x16 - the fine

6
00:00:41,205 -> 00:00:43,605
Made by matiasmab21
* From fans to fans *

7
00:01:11,225 -> 00:01:12,806
This is his request Mrs. Burden.

8
00:01:12,907 -> 00:01:15,607
Remember ... this is the one to take it orally.

9
00:01:16,508 -> 00:01:17,208
"Stop pushing me"

10
00:01:17,209 -> 00:01:18,209
"Shut Dewey

11
00:01:18,610 -> 00:01:19,810
- I was not! -

12
00:01:20,211 -> 00:01:23,911
Hey guys, I'll finish this in 5 minutes and then go
the academy of hairdressing.

13
00:01:24,112 -> 00:01:25,612
Why not go to a normal hairdresser?

14
00:01:25,613 -> 00:01:27,613
Because I like to support education.

15
00:01:27,814 -> 00:01:28,814
It's free.

16
00:01:28,815 -> 00:01:31,815
What will make my hair to make a damn Dewey?

17
00:01:32,016 -> 00:01:32,816
Honey ...

18
00:01:32,817 -> 00:01:34,017
... We've talked about this.

19
00:01:34,318 -> 00:01:37,018
All the words from the mouth of Reese ...

20
00:01:37,019 -> 00:01:39,019
... Are lies, remember?

21
00:01:39,620 -> 00:01:41,420
Well, go get some magazines.

22
00:01:42,021 -> 00:01:44,221
And everything is broken I will deduct
their allowance.

23
00:01:44,222 -> 00:01:45,322
Never give us an allowance!

24
00:01:45,323 -> 00:01:46,523
Yes, and you know why.

25
00:01:47,824 -> 00:01:51,624
I will ask the barber to shave me all of this
on the other side and nothing ...

26
00:01:51,825 -> 00:01:53,625
It will be a different style for each profile ...

27
00:01:53,826 -> 00:01:55,626
Different for every mood.

28
00:02:00,327 -> 00:02:00,927
How are you?

29
00:02:00,928 -> 00:02:01,628
Not bad ...

30
00:02:01,929 -> 00:02:03,229
5 more minutes and I am free ...

31
00:02:03,630 -> 00:02:04,430
And you?

32
00:02:04,431 -> 00:02:05,431
I can not complain.

33
00:02:05,832 -> 00:02:07,332
Are $ 6.24

34
00:02:10,233 -> 00:02:10,933
Sorry. What?

35
00:02:11,234 -> 00:02:13,634
A total of $ 6 to 24 cents.

36
00:02:16,435 -> 00:02:17,235
Is there a problem?

37
00:02:17,236 -> 00:02:19,236
No, it's just that ... that ...

38
00:02:19,837 -> 00:02:23,537
Store manager and I have a fix.

39
00:02:24,338 -> 00:02:26,038
I know nothing about that.

40
00:02:28,239 -> 00:02:29,739
I have only $ 3.

41
00:02:30,040 -> 00:02:31,740
Well, you can leave the magazine.

42
00:02:32,341 -> 00:02:34,341
Lois ... Lois!

43
00:02:34,542 -> 00:02:36,342
I make a discount to the Stockton official.

44
00:02:36,643 -> 00:02:39,443
You know ... the discount to the police is 100%.

45
00:02:39,744 -> 00:02:41,444
Craig, I can not do that!

46
00:02:41,445 -> 00:02:42,145
But Lois ...

47
00:02:42,146 -> 00:02:44,146
Do not worry about that, fine Greg.

48
00:02:44,447 -> 00:02:45,447
It's Craig.

49
00:02:46,848 -> 00:02:47,848
Are you crazy?

50
00:02:48,049 -> 00:02:49,249
Not sure how this works?

51
00:02:49,450 -> 00:02:51,550
If you scratch your back scratching ours.

52
00:02:51,651 -> 00:02:55,051
If you give away something he fights for us, is called protection.

53
00:02:55,352 -> 00:02:58,752
Craig, we have won 5 times in the last 6 months!

54
00:02:59,753 -> 00:03:02,253
Lois, think of all the places you can get
free stuff ...

55
00:03:02,454 -> 00:03:04,254
... It can not be everywhere!

56
00:03:11,255 -> 00:03:14,455
Mom really, I will not let the dwarf
two fingers cut my hair again.

57
00:03:14,456 -> 00:03:17,056
That's all you need to use scissors, and better
to be polite.

58
00:03:17,357 -> 00:03:19,457
These people are very nervous.

59
00:03:21,658 -> 00:03:22,458
What?!

60
00:03:22,959 -> 00:03:23,959
No I did nothing!

61
00:03:24,460 -> 00:03:26,460
Mom tries to escape, we will have the news!

62
00:03:26,461 -> 00:03:28,461
Well guys, I do not hear a word.

63
00:03:28,562 -> 00:03:32,462
Do not make pig noises, smells or say that baseball
nor that they were kidnapped.

64
00:03:35,463 -> 00:03:36,463
Do you?

65
00:03:36,464 -> 00:03:38,164
Driver's license please.

66
00:03:38,465 -> 00:03:39,465
What is this?

67
00:03:39,566 -> 00:03:43,466
I do not respect the crossing signal, to get a car on the avenue
a car had to brake.

68
00:03:43,667 -> 00:03:44,467
How does auto mean?

69
00:03:44,468 -> 00:03:46,468
Look left and there was no car!

70
00:03:47,469 -> 00:03:49,769
Lady driver's license.

71
00:03:51,270 -> 00:03:53,270
Well, do not think you do not know why this.

72
00:03:53,671 -> 00:03:55,671
I did it because you pay the iced tea.

73
00:03:56,372 -> 00:03:57,472
Was it you?

74
00:03:59,473 -> 00:04:05,473
Well, now Just stay seated, I have to fill in forms and
check the computer and the computer goes slow so it might take.

75
00:04:06,274 -> 00:04:08,574
Well, do what you want, my background is clean.

76
00:04:08,875 -> 00:04:12,075
Hey, there's no way you have 16 unpaid fines!

77
00:04:12,376 -> 00:04:13,576
The computer was wrong!

78
00:04:14,377 -> 00:04:16,577
Do not get away with it.

79
00:04:18,278 -> 00:04:18,678
Hey Mom.

80
00:04:18,679 -> 00:04:21,679
Is it a bad time to tell you I got kicked out of the practice?

81
00:04:21,680 -> 00:04:23,480
I mean, is silly compared to this.

82
00:04:23,981 -> 00:04:26,481
Lois mood, bring the boys home.

83
00:04:26,782 -> 00:04:28,082
I'll wait.

84
00:04:28,683 -> 00:04:30,783
Guys want to be good with Craig.

85
00:04:31,184 -> 00:04:32,884
And Dewey ... you're not scared.

86
00:04:33,385 -> 00:04:34,585
Mom will be fine.

87
00:04:34,686 -> 00:04:35,886
Can you turn on the siren?

88
00:04:35,887 -> 00:04:36,887
Sure!

89
00:04:37,788 -> 00:04:38,488
Sii!

90
00:04:45,289 -> 00:04:48,289
Come on baby, admit it was an exciting situation.

91
00:04:49,090 -> 00:04:51,290
I had to go to get you out of jail.

92
00:04:52,691 -> 00:04:53,891
It was exciting for me.

93
00:04:54,592 -> 00:05:02,692
If Hal was very exciting to be there thinking about how it would take my children
the horrible things would imagine thinking that his mother was in jail.

94
00:05:02,993 -> 00:05:04,693
Mama, Did you get a tattoo?

95
00:05:05,294 -> 00:05:06,194
I do not understand ...

96
00:05:06,795 -> 00:05:09,595
How could you have gotten 16 fines if they do not even
know about them?

97
00:05:10,696 -> 00:05:12,096
Mama, just calm down!

98
00:05:12,097 -> 00:05:14,697
I was in prison, Francis!

99
00:05:14,698 -> 00:05:15,698
In jail!

100
00:05:15,699 -> 00:05:18,099
And all because they parked where they should!

101
00:05:18,300 -> 00:05:20,800
How did you get 16 parking tickets?

102
00:05:20,801 -> 00:05:21,801
Not my fault.

103
00:05:22,002 -> 00:05:23,302
I have enclosed here.

104
00:05:23,403 -> 00:05:26,603
When I go home I'm so desperate that I find
a place to park.

105
00:05:26,704 -> 00:05:28,304
Listen sir ...

106
00:05:28,305 -> 00:05:33,005
Your irresponsible behavior went too far and
you'll suffer the consequences!

107
00:05:33,506 -> 00:05:35,706
You're gonna pay those parking tickets!

108
00:05:35,907 -> 00:05:37,807
Mom, the prison was hard for you.

109
00:05:38,008 -> 00:05:39,308
Francis I'm serious ...

110
00:05:39,409 -> 00:05:47,509
We will return the fines, plus $ 155 we paid for
retrieve the car, means that $ 747 and you owe us 13 cents!

111
00:05:47,810 -> 00:05:49,710
That is totally unfair!

112
00:05:50,011 -> 00:05:52,711
None of this would have happened if you were a reckless driver.

113
00:05:52,712 -> 00:05:54,212
Excuse me?!

114
00:05:54,213 -> 00:05:57,313
When parked near a mailbox, no
hurt anyone's life.

115
00:05:57,614 -> 00:05:59,114
I do not hurt anyone!

116
00:05:59,315 -> 00:06:03,115
I was arrested by a corrupt police officer saying he had committed
I never committed an offense.

117
00:06:03,416 -> 00:06:07,116
But when I tell you accuse me unjustly send me
to military school.

118
00:06:07,317 -> 00:06:08,617
What irony, right?!

119
00:06:08,618 -> 00:06:10,118
That police had followed me!

120
00:06:10,119 -> 00:06:14,519
Of course, if all chasing you, and the neighbor's cat
is the leader of the conspiracy, Did You Know?

121
00:06:15,320 -> 00:06:17,320
You can laugh all you want, Francis.

122
00:06:17,421 -> 00:06:20,321
But unless you come with money, not come home.

123
00:06:20,822 -> 00:06:23,622
Where am I supposed to get $ 700?

124
00:06:24,123 -> 00:06:26,223
You're just using an excuse for blankets here!

125
00:06:26,224 -> 00:06:28,624
If, indeed, was the idea of cat!

126
00:06:29,425 -> 00:06:32,725
Mom, there's no way you can get that Francis
amount of money.

127
00:06:33,726 -> 00:06:36,726
But he would have thought ...

128
00:06:37,127 -> 00:06:39,927
Before doing that thing ... bad ... bad.

129
00:06:39,928 -> 00:06:42,528
Baby do not worry about it, everything will be fine.

130
00:06:42,829 -> 00:06:43,929
Francis think of something.

131
00:06:44,430 -> 00:06:46,330
Now the traffic school is fun.

132
00:06:46,531 -> 00:06:49,931
Cooking classes are classes bowling ... ...

133
00:06:49,932 -> 00:06:51,732
Remember when I went to traffic school?

134
00:06:51,733 -> 00:06:53,133
My God! That was fun!

135
00:06:54,034 -> 00:06:56,734
A rabbi, a priest and a minister came y. ..

136
00:06:56,735 -> 00:06:58,635
I will not go to traffic school!

137
00:06:59,636 -> 00:07:02,336
But baby if you're not going to bring you traffic school
serious misconduct on your driver's license.

138
00:07:02,337 -> 00:07:05,137
I will not have any fault with my license because I
take this to court!

139
00:07:05,438 -> 00:07:06,438
No I did nothing wrong!

140
00:07:06,839 -> 00:07:08,439
And I have three witnesses to prove it!

141
00:07:08,940 -> 00:07:10,640
They saw exactly what happened.

142
00:07:29,332 -> 00:07:34,641
Dewey, Dewey, Dewey ...

143
00:07:35,042 -> 00:07:36,642
Okay mom.
Yes.

144
00:07:36,843 -> 00:07:37,743
Do you see Hal?

145
00:07:37,744 -> 00:07:39,244
Is a clear case of corruption.

146
00:07:39,745 -> 00:07:43,045
The police run out of tea and invent an offense to take
fines.

147
00:07:43,046 -> 00:07:44,146
We will fight for this.

148
00:07:44,147 -> 00:07:46,347
Well, why not think about it baby ...

149
00:07:46,848 -> 00:07:50,148
You know I will be your word with it and the judges always
are on the side of the police.

150
00:07:50,349 -> 00:07:51,649
If I already have that.

151
00:07:51,850 -> 00:07:53,650
That's what he thinks will be
quit lying.

152
00:07:53,951 -> 00:07:54,651
I will not allow it!

153
00:07:54,952 -> 00:07:55,952
Because I know I have reason.

154
00:07:56,553 -> 00:07:59,753
If you know love, but what happens if something goes wrong?

155
00:07:59,754 -> 00:08:01,854
We can not increase insurance permitirno.

156
00:08:01,855 -> 00:08:03,155
I will not lose!

157
00:08:03,456 -> 00:08:05,656
I'll be right, and finally prove it.

158
00:08:06,657 -> 00:08:07,257
Okay.

159
00:08:09,158 -> 00:08:11,558
If that's what you do, you have our full support.

160
00:08:11,859 -> 00:08:16,559
Remember Mama, in a world of lies, the truth is
only weapon.

161
00:08:18,960 -> 00:08:20,560
What? Is not it?

162
00:08:20,961 -> 00:08:21,761
Thanks.

163
00:08:25,762 -> 00:08:28,262
Hey lady, how was jail?

164
00:08:28,263 -> 00:08:29,263
Well, thanks.

165
00:08:30,264 -> 00:08:32,264
Should not you be chasing a thief or something?

166
00:08:32,765 -> 00:08:38,165
Yes, I was planning to do that after paying
time my iced tea.

167
00:08:39,166 -> 00:08:40,566
I will fight for that fine you know?

168
00:08:40,567 -> 00:08:42,267
Well, you want to see you in court.

169
00:08:43,568 -> 00:08:44,568
Drive carefully.

170
00:08:45,269 -> 00:08:46,269
When you retrieve your car.

171
00:08:51,870 -> 00:08:54,770
There is no way that I have that cop
turn seen this street.

172
00:08:57,071 -> 00:08:57,571
Yes?

173
00:08:57,572 -> 00:08:58,972
Mom, good news.

174
00:08:58,973 -> 00:09:00,873
Francis, I'm kinda busy here!

175
00:09:00,874 -> 00:09:01,674
Well, here it is:

176
00:09:01,775 -> 00:09:04,375
I just sent $ 20 as proof of my good intentions.

177
00:09:04,376 -> 00:09:04,876
Great! ...

178
00:09:04,977 -> 00:09:07,177
We only have $ 727 so you can come home.

179
00:09:07,378 -> 00:09:07,878
What?

180
00:09:07,879 -> 00:09:10,579
Francis will not let you forget your responsibilities.

181
00:09:10,980 -> 00:09:16,580
Because of you we are with just your father's car to copper.
So you better come with all the money, or not go.

182
00:09:16,681 -> 00:09:17,681
Mom ... is impossible!

183
00:09:17,682 -> 00:09:22,682
I'm at school, when I'm at school I have homework,
I do my homework when I'm not arrested ...

184
00:09:22,683 -> 00:09:29,483
... If I have luck I have 6 hours off a week. In this
rate could not go home until Thanksgiving 2010.

185
00:09:29,684 -> 00:09:30,784
So bring the money.

186
00:09:37,285 -> 00:09:38,785
Bring money.

187
00:09:39,786 -> 00:09:41,286
Hi, Do you know where this Craig?

188
00:09:43,087 -> 00:09:45,787
The store manager a big guy who smells like cabbage.

189
00:09:46,488 -> 00:09:47,488
Thanks.

190
00:09:49,989 -> 00:09:51,289
Is not there.

191
00:09:51,290 -> 00:09:54,490
Still looking ... lower ...

192
00:09:54,991 -> 00:09:55,491
Craig ...

193
00:09:55,492 -> 00:09:57,192
Mom said that I can take some books.

194
00:09:57,193 -> 00:09:58,193
Sure sure ...

195
00:09:59,494 -> 00:10:00,494
What are you doing?

196
00:10:01,895 -> 00:10:05,095
... I was reviewing some old recordings ...

197
00:10:05,096 -> 00:10:09,096
You know ... I look for a pattern, watch people, never
you know ...

198
00:10:09,897 -> 00:10:11,497
Hey, that girl is stealing something!

199
00:10:13,998 -> 00:10:15,198
I did not realize.

200
00:10:15,699 -> 00:10:17,299
Better then reviewed other recordings.

201
00:10:22,300 -> 00:10:25,300
* * * Hot Mamas shopping cheerleader * * The girl in green dress *
* Mount miniskirt * * The loose blouse / low half * * Fat Boys released the photos *
The baby beats his mother *

202
00:10:25,401 -> 00:10:27,601
Wait, There are cameras throughout the store?

203
00:10:27,602 -> 00:10:28,602
Yes, by all parties.

204
00:10:29,603 -> 00:10:32,103
The pharmacy, drugstore, bath ...

205
00:10:32,704 -> 00:10:33,504
Yes, a lot of cameras.

206
00:10:33,605 -> 00:10:34,905
Is there any in the parking lot?

207
00:10:38,606 -> 00:10:39,106
What happens?

208
00:10:39,107 -> 00:10:40,807
A girl he dropped a can under the car.

209
00:10:41,708 -> 00:10:42,808
Sorry.

210
00:10:45,009 -> 00:10:46,309
Wait, stop, that's our truck!

211
00:10:55,810 -> 00:10:56,710
She did ...

212
00:10:57,511 -> 00:10:58,711
Is guilty ...

213
00:11:00,012 -> 00:11:02,712
Mom ... was wrong.

214
00:11:08,513 -> 00:11:09,713
My God!

215
00:11:10,514 -> 00:11:11,714
Mom was right!

216
00:11:11,915 -> 00:11:13,715
I have to rebuild my world view.

217
00:11:13,716 -> 00:11:14,916
I know, this is amazing!

218
00:11:15,917 -> 00:11:16,917
We have to show it!

219
00:11:16,918 -> 00:11:17,718
Wait.

220
00:11:17,919 -> 00:11:21,719
Maybe we should save it for next time Mom
we cry out, and surprise.

221
00:11:22,020 -> 00:11:22,920
No, I think it's better now.

222
00:11:22,921 -> 00:11:23,921
Okay, let's go.

223
00:11:23,922 -> 00:11:26,122
Wait, we have to face serious.

224
00:11:26,123 -> 00:11:27,123
Well.

225
00:11:28,824 -> 00:11:29,924
I'm ready.

226
00:11:30,425 -> 00:11:31,325
No, I'm not.

227
00:11:31,326 -> 00:11:32,326
Stop smiling.

228
00:11:33,127 -> 00:11:34,027
Come on, stop.

229
00:11:35,428 -> 00:11:36,028
Hi honey.

230
00:11:36,529 -> 00:11:37,629
I had a great day.

231
00:11:38,530 -> 00:11:43,130
The fire alarm was activated and got the
last candy left in the machine.

232
00:11:44,231 -> 00:11:47,131
I thought it was not going to fall but with my butt golpié y. .. boom!

233
00:11:48,532 -> 00:11:50,032
Who is Susan King?

234
00:11:54,733 -> 00:11:55,533
"Susan King?

235
00:11:56,834 -> 00:11:57,534
"Susan King?

236
00:11:57,535 -> 00:11:58,535
Give me a second.

237
00:12:00,936 -> 00:12:04,036
Okay, before I say something, or just know you're asking.

238
00:12:04,437 -> 00:12:07,037
A call today to ask why the insurance could rise ...

239
00:12:07,538 -> 00:12:08,438
Why do that?

240
00:12:08,439 -> 00:12:12,139
It's nothing, the telephone, I wanted to know some things ...

241
00:12:12,140 -> 00:12:14,040
How about what would happen if I lose?

242
00:12:14,441 -> 00:12:15,841
Well ... yes ...

243
00:12:15,842 -> 00:12:18,842
... Wanted to know what would happen in the worst case.

244
00:12:19,143 -> 00:12:19,743
See if ...

245
00:12:19,744 -> 00:12:21,444
There is nothing of the "see if" Hal!

246
00:12:21,445 -> 00:12:24,145
You're right ... you are quite right.

247
00:12:25,046 -> 00:12:28,846
And though our insurance will increase and we can not afford two cars,
just sell one ...

248
00:12:29,147 -> 00:12:30,747
I mean, people did before cars?

249
00:12:30,748 -> 00:12:31,748
They ... they walked.

250
00:12:31,749 -> 00:12:33,049
So ... walk.

251
00:12:33,050 -> 00:12:34,750
What you expect is to lose ...

252
00:12:35,051 -> 00:12:36,251
Is that the way you support me?

253
00:12:36,452 -> 00:12:40,752
If you support but ... I think we need to know
what we're getting into.

254
00:12:41,453 -> 00:12:44,053
I mean ... is it worth getting into this?

255
00:12:44,454 -> 00:12:45,554
Yes, Hal.

256
00:12:45,555 -> 00:12:47,755
I have to defend what you believe is worthwhile.

257
00:12:48,256 -> 00:12:50,756
I think we get to blame me as worth it!

258
00:12:51,257 -> 00:12:54,057
I'm sure I could win because I know I have right!

259
00:12:54,658 -> 00:12:56,858
I can not believe you have so little faith in me!

260
00:12:56,959 -> 00:13:00,859
I have complete faith in you ... is the rest of the world to
they do not I have faith!

261
00:13:02,060 -> 00:13:04,160
Things may look different to different people.

262
00:13:04,261 -> 00:13:05,461
The system may be corrupt.

263
00:13:05,662 -> 00:13:07,762
Not be in this situation if they did not.

264
00:13:08,063 -> 00:13:11,763
Lois And sometimes, being right is not enough.

265
00:13:11,864 -> 00:13:14,164
Being right ... it!

266
00:13:14,765 -> 00:13:19,165
Hal No I did nothing wrong, and I really need to try it.
I know it will be difficult.

267
00:13:19,166 -> 00:13:21,966
That's why I need my own family
trust me.

268
00:13:22,167 -> 00:13:24,167
How many times do I have to say that I have right?

269
00:13:24,168 -> 00:13:28,968
I have reason. I swear on my children's lives ...
I have reason!

270
00:13:32,369 -> 00:13:33,369
What do you want?

271
00:13:36,170 -> 00:13:37,270
Nothing.

272
00:13:37,671 -> 00:13:39,271
I can not believe you chickened out!

273
00:13:39,472 -> 00:13:41,172
Me? You're the one who disappeared!

274
00:13:41,573 -> 00:13:43,073
Now you blame me me!

275
00:13:43,074 -> 00:13:43,874
Look ...

276
00:13:43,975 -> 00:13:46,275
Mom is going to unload their anger to anyone
show you the tape.

277
00:13:46,276 -> 00:13:47,276
I do not!

278
00:13:48,677 -> 00:13:50,277
Maybe we could send mail without a destination ...

279
00:13:50,678 -> 00:13:51,478
I do not!

280
00:13:51,679 -> 00:13:52,879
Okay, but I need ...

281
00:13:52,880 -> 00:13:53,880
I do not!

282
00:13:54,381 -> 00:13:56,281
Look ... someone has to be the one ...

283
00:13:56,282 -> 00:13:56,682
I do not!

284
00:13:56,683 -> 00:13:57,483
We give you the card!

285
00:13:57,484 -> 00:13:58,484
I will.

286
00:14:01,685 -> 00:14:02,885
Let me explain again ...

287
00:14:03,386 -> 00:14:09,286
Each one of us will pay $ 50 and you will jump from the roof of
uploaded to the gym bedroom on the mower.

288
00:14:09,487 -> 00:14:10,387
Who's in?

289
00:14:10,488 -> 00:14:12,888
And that includes keeping the grass bag?

290
00:14:12,889 -> 00:14:13,889
Are you crazy?

291
00:14:14,290 -> 00:14:15,690
You know that would create resistance?

292
00:14:15,991 -> 00:14:18,291
I do not know. Sounds too easy.

293
00:14:19,292 -> 00:14:20,692
Tend to agree, they think this ...

294
00:14:20,693 -> 00:14:22,993
$ 5 extra I will bind up the eyes.

295
00:14:24,394 -> 00:14:25,794
Francis, telephone.

296
00:14:26,295 -> 00:14:27,095
Think about it.

297
00:14:28,796 -> 00:14:29,496
Hello?

298
00:14:29,697 -> 00:14:30,497
Hi Francis!

299
00:14:30,798 -> 00:14:31,998
Do you know what the fine?

300
00:14:31,999 -> 00:14:35,699
Well ... I have a video that shows that mom was to blame y. ..

301
00:14:35,700 -> 00:14:36,700
Is she right?

302
00:14:37,001 -> 00:14:37,701
If ...

303
00:14:37,902 -> 00:14:38,702
And I'm trying to find out ...

304
00:14:38,703 -> 00:14:40,003
Why call me?

305
00:14:40,304 -> 00:14:44,104
You irreputable proof that Mom was right!
Resfriégasela in the face!

306
00:14:44,305 -> 00:14:46,205
Francis, I do not think that's a good idea.

307
00:14:46,206 -> 00:14:48,106
Are you kidding?
"It's brilliant

308
00:14:48,207 -> 00:14:52,207
From now on what she says something it
we take in the face!

309
00:14:52,408 -> 00:14:53,808
Francis, I can not!

310
00:14:54,009 -> 00:14:55,809
If I show this video mom go crazy!

311
00:14:56,310 -> 00:14:58,810
And then kill the messenger, that's me!

312
00:14:59,311 -> 00:15:01,211
You're asking me to suicide!

313
00:15:01,312 -> 00:15:02,912
Think that will face!

314
00:15:10,513 -> 00:15:12,913
We thought it best to show it to you first.

315
00:15:14,514 -> 00:15:17,514
I can not say I'm glad you have done but
I guess they did the right thing.

316
00:15:17,515 -> 00:15:18,615
Then go to show it!

317
00:15:18,616 -> 00:15:19,416
I do not!

318
00:15:19,417 -> 00:15:20,417
Dad!

319
00:15:21,218 -> 00:15:25,218
Agree, but ... we need to prepare the ground ...
wait for the right time.

320
00:15:25,219 -> 00:15:27,719
This is a very delicate matter.

321
00:15:28,020 -> 00:15:28,720
Hal!

322
00:15:35,721 -> 00:15:38,721
I could swear that that cop was following me all the way home!

323
00:15:39,422 -> 00:15:43,022
Lois We do not believe that you have followed, I'm sure
had more important things to do!

324
00:15:48,723 -> 00:15:50,023
What do you think you're doing here?

325
00:15:50,324 -> 00:15:55,424
My commander told me that you asked for my record, to
This is so right ...

326
00:15:55,625 -> 00:15:58,525
... Decided to do a little walk and give
in hand.

327
00:16:00,026 -> 00:16:00,826
Nice house.

328
00:16:01,027 -> 00:16:02,827
Do not try to intimidate me.

329
00:16:03,328 -> 00:16:04,628
All I said was that it has a nice house.

330
00:16:04,629 -> 00:16:08,129
First and then throws me is false threats ...
Well that will not work ...

331
00:16:08,630 -> 00:16:11,130
... I'm sorry I stumbled going to me!

332
00:16:12,631 -> 00:16:13,831
Have a good day lady.

333
00:16:14,132 -> 00:16:17,032
You'll pay for what I've done, You hear me?

334
00:16:17,033 -> 00:16:18,433
You're going to pay!

335
00:16:19,034 -> 00:16:23,934
I do not care how long it takes or how much money it costs.
I win because I have reason!

336
00:16:30,035 -> 00:16:32,235
There's something you have to do ...

337
00:16:39,936 -> 00:16:41,936
Honey, I'm sorry you have to do that but ...

338
00:16:42,637 -> 00:16:45,437
... Is better show it now before it is
too late.

339
00:16:48,738 -> 00:16:49,838
Is wrong.

340
00:16:50,839 -> 00:16:51,539
What?

341
00:16:51,840 -> 00:16:52,840
The tape is wrong.

342
00:16:55,341 -> 00:16:56,441
Dad ...!

343
00:16:56,742 -> 00:17:03,442
And her mother heard the tape ... ... is ...

344
00:17:05,143 -> 00:17:06,043
God!

345
00:17:10,644 -> 00:17:11,544
Honey ...

346
00:17:11,745 -> 00:17:12,545
Look ...

347
00:17:12,846 -> 00:17:13,846
I'm not stupid.

348
00:17:14,147 -> 00:17:14,847
I saw the tape.

349
00:17:16,148 -> 00:17:16,848
But is wrong.

350
00:17:17,349 -> 00:17:19,849
I do not know how to explain ... but I know.

351
00:17:20,050 -> 00:17:20,850
I know.

352
00:17:21,151 -> 00:17:22,451
This tape is wrong.

353
00:17:24,052 -> 00:17:24,752
I believe you.

354
00:17:24,753 -> 00:17:25,453
No, do not believe me!

355
00:17:25,454 -> 00:17:26,454
Well, what did you expect?

356
00:17:26,455 -> 00:17:27,855
Expected to believe me.

357
00:17:29,656 -> 00:17:33,856
In the past 20 years and never admits a mistake
not need to.

358
00:17:34,057 -> 00:17:36,657
But the truth is out there in front of your eyes.

359
00:17:36,658 -> 00:17:38,958
And this time you're wrong!

360
00:17:39,659 -> 00:17:42,459
That still do not see it ... I feel crazy!

361
00:17:42,460 -> 00:17:43,860
I'm not crazy!

362
00:17:44,161 -> 00:17:46,161
The tape is bad, you must be!

363
00:17:46,662 -> 00:17:48,662
What do you mean? Does anyone upset?

364
00:17:48,663 -> 00:17:50,563
No. .. I ...

365
00:17:50,964 -> 00:17:52,764
I ... I know ... I know!

366
00:17:52,765 -> 00:17:54,665
I'm just saying it's wrong!

367
00:17:55,166 -> 00:17:56,066
I know what happened ...

368
00:17:56,367 -> 00:17:57,567
And I know I have reason.

369
00:17:57,568 -> 00:18:02,268
According baby, it could be. But I and
rest of the world tend to believe what we see.

370
00:18:02,569 -> 00:18:05,769
And it all shows you are wrong!

371
00:18:05,470 -> 00:18:08,270
The universe is asking you to give up!

372
00:18:08,871 -> 00:18:10,271
It's time to let go.

373
00:18:14,772 -> 00:18:15,372
Well ...

374
00:18:16,473 -> 00:18:17,473
That's not fair.

375
00:18:21,474 -> 00:18:23,074
You know what it is not fair, Lois?

376
00:18:23,675 -> 00:18:26,075
Having to be right all the time!

377
00:18:26,376 -> 00:18:27,976
It is a terrible burden!

378
00:18:28,877 -> 00:18:32,977
Would not it be relief for you ... admit it?

379
00:18:34,478 -> 00:18:38,478
Want to say I was wrong ... when I know
I have reason?

380
00:18:38,979 -> 00:18:39,179
Yes.

381
00:18:39,780 -> 00:18:41,080
Yes, that's exactly what I want ...

382
00:18:41,081 -> 00:18:43,281
... I know that Lois does not happen very often but ...

383
00:18:43,982 -> 00:18:48,482
... You have to accept that ... no ... you're right.

384
00:18:49,083 -> 00:18:50,883
But I have reason!

385
00:18:50,884 -> 00:18:51,384
Let love.

386
00:18:51,385 -> 00:18:51,685
But ...

387
00:18:52,086 -> 00:18:53,086
Just once!

388
00:18:53,587 -> 00:18:54,587
Can you do that?

389
00:18:55,088 -> 00:18:56,088
Let.

390
00:19:01,289 -> 00:19:04,489
It's okay ... you see?

391
00:19:05,390 -> 00:19:08,490
Okay ... fine.

392
00:19:08,491 -> 00:19:09,491
Can you tell?

393
00:19:09,492 -> 00:19:10,492
Yes.

394
00:19:13,893 -> 00:19:18,493
... I was wrong!

395
00:19:18,994 -> 00:19:19,994
That is fine.

396
00:19:20,795 -> 00:19:22,795
See? It is not so bad.

397
00:19:24,596 -> 00:19:31,796
Acedemia go to the traffic ... and meet nice people ...
will tell good jokes car ...

398
00:19:32,597 -> 00:19:33,797
Everything will be fine.

399
00:19:34,098 -> 00:19:34,998
Everything will be fine ...

400
00:19:38,699 -> 00:19:40,999
I'm so proud of you.

401
00:19:42,700 -> 00:19:44,300
You're so great.

402
00:19:45,501 -> 00:19:47,101
You are so beautiful.

403
00:19:48,302 -> 00:19:50,102
You are so wrong.

404
00:19:53,803 -> 00:19:56,803
How many times do I have to tell them not to leave
the refrigerator open?

405
00:19:57,104 -> 00:19:58,104
You did.

406
00:19:59,505 -> 00:20:00,505
Maybe yes.

407
00:20:01,806 -> 00:20:03,206
Has been well all week.

408
00:20:03,507 -> 00:20:05,507
It is as if his spirit was destroyed.

409
00:20:05,508 -> 00:20:06,508
It's great.

410
00:20:07,409 -> 00:20:08,909
Hi Francis, on the money ...

411
00:20:09,010 -> 00:20:12,210
Well listen, I have $ 122 and could ...

412
00:20:12,211 -> 00:20:13,811
Francis, cry me so angry.

413
00:20:13,812 -> 00:20:16,312
Why not use that money to come home next
weekend?

414
00:20:16,513 -> 00:20:17,313
But ...

415
00:20:17,814 -> 00:20:19,214
I have to go to traffic school, I love you. Adios.

416
00:20:25,015 -> 00:20:26,715
Adios.

417
00:20:26,716 -> 00:20:27,916
Grabbed 2 pieces.

418
00:20:28,917 -> 00:20:30,017
Where is Lois has gone?

419
00:20:30,018 -> 00:20:30,718
Craig ...

420
00:20:31,119 -> 00:20:33,319
Guys are not going to believe what I have ...

421
00:20:33,720 -> 00:20:37,320
I made a deal with the owner of a supermarket on the street
across ...

422
00:20:37,321 -> 00:20:40,821
... Exchanged tapes to better understand the safety
our customers.

423
00:20:40,822 -> 00:20:42,422
"Short skirt, windy day?

424
00:20:43,023 -> 00:20:43,823
Is a code.

425
00:20:43,824 -> 00:20:49,524
In the other video camera filmed from a different angle Lois
just before you do the fine.

426
00:21:01,225 -> 00:21:02,225
Do you see?

427
00:21:02,626 -> 00:21:04,326
Lois was right all the time!

428
00:21:04,427 -> 00:21:07,227
This frees it from the fault, is not it great?

429
00:21:16,228 -> 00:21:17,628
What are you doing?

430
00:21:23,429 -> 00:21:26,629
Never told about it.

431
00:21:26,630 -> 00:21:27,630
But I ...

432
00:21:27,631 -> 00:21:28,631
Never.

433
00:21:31,632 -> 00:21:32,632
Understood?
