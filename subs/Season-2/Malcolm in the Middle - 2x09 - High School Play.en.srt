1
00:00:04,239 -> 00:00:05,166
Arrive

2
00:00:05,167 -> 00:00:06,167
Hi honey

3
00:00:06,678 -> 00:00:09,148
Today we will be alone,
could go out to dinner

4
00:00:09,302 -> 00:00:10,597
What about the kids?

5
00:00:10,598 -> 00:00:14,339
Malcolm is with Stevie
Reese in the practice of Jockey

6
00:00:14,340 -> 00:00:16,967
Billy Dewey's house o..
in the home of a neighborhood boy

7
00:00:16,968 -> 00:00:18,215
So we will be alone

8
00:00:18,843 -> 00:00:20,131
What do you do?

9
00:00:25,991 -> 00:00:28,035
This was a new record

10
00:01:03,648 -> 00:01:06,370
We always ask that we
volunteer for anything

11
00:01:06,371 -> 00:01:09,600
think we are social rejects
and we have nothing to do

12
00:01:09,935 -> 00:01:11,087
and it is true

13
00:01:11,088 -> 00:01:13,062
but I do not like
remember me

14
00:01:13,063 -> 00:01:17,724
Okay, we need a guy
of age for school work

15
00:01:17,725 -> 00:01:18,725
It will be fun!

16
00:01:18,726 -> 00:01:21,693
the work is a man called
William Shakespeare

17
00:01:21,694 -> 00:01:23,960
that I used to write it
long ago

18
00:01:23,961 -> 00:01:25,406
It was a hopeless alcoholic

19
00:01:25,407 -> 00:01:27,916
Concealing the fourteenth
Earl of Oxford

20
00:01:27,917 -> 00:01:30,307
Why can not you leave him alone!

21
00:01:30,308 -> 00:01:32,975
and that if the tube
benefit of education

22
00:01:32,976 -> 00:01:35,445
Many academics have
read King Lear

23
00:01:37,210 -> 00:01:40,031
Well well .. remember
we have a guest

24
00:01:40,032 -> 00:01:43,516
Let this discussion
for Friday's debate

25
00:01:43,517 -> 00:01:45,181
Megan .. continuous

26
00:01:45,182 -> 00:01:46,405
Whoever was

27
00:01:46,406 -> 00:01:47,887
He had a pointed beard

28
00:01:47,888 -> 00:01:50,867
and wrote a play called
"Dream of a Summer Night

29
00:01:50,868 -> 00:01:53,220
We need someone to do
Faun child

30
00:01:53,221 -> 00:01:56,726
before you get too excited
there is a downside

31
00:01:56,727 -> 00:01:58,892
- They may have to miss class
- I will!

32
00:01:59,185 -> 00:02:02,019
You can not! We work in a
secret project ..

33
00:02:03,489 -> 00:02:05,090
eh said too much ...

34
00:02:05,311 -> 00:02:09,504
Okay, I thought we had
clear, no more secret projects

35
00:02:09,505 -> 00:02:13,912
did not recover any of you
eyebrows from his latest project

36
00:02:13,913 -> 00:02:15,807
- I can do both
- Very good

37
00:02:15,808 -> 00:02:18,310
As long as you are clear
what are your priorities

38
00:02:18,311 -> 00:02:19,369
I can go now ...

39
00:02:33,480 -> 00:02:36,904
... Before I thought it was boring but now
that is interesting is bisexual

40
00:02:36,905 -> 00:02:40,604
God! True! since
completely change the personality

41
00:02:40,605 -> 00:02:42,977
oh! and listen to
Mark has left ....

42
00:02:45,943 -> 00:02:48,418
oh, "On the Road" what I have read,
is a good book

43
00:02:49,799 -> 00:02:52,351
He is Travis
do not bother

44
00:02:53,972 -> 00:02:55,413
Look at these people!

45
00:02:55,414 -> 00:02:58,556
have piercings are gross
rarely wear clothes

46
00:02:58,857 -> 00:03:00,440
Do not worry about anything!

47
00:03:01,706 -> 00:03:03,599
is a room
Francis filled

48
00:03:03,600 -> 00:03:05,237
Okay, people!

49
00:03:05,238 -> 00:03:07,821
We will make .. Act 3 scene 2

50
00:03:07,822 -> 00:03:09,400
Oberon, Puck

51
00:03:09,895 -> 00:03:12,621
- Where's My Puck?
- I think he was wrestling

52
00:03:13,488 -> 00:03:14,874
Hey, you!

53
00:03:14,875 -> 00:03:15,875
Child Fauno

54
00:03:15,876 -> 00:03:17,752
- Can you read?
- Claro

55
00:03:17,753 -> 00:03:19,579
already won half

56
00:03:19,580 -> 00:03:22,770
Puck You will by now
read page 27

57
00:03:25,009 -> 00:03:27,376
This is negligence ...

58
00:03:27,377 -> 00:03:30,485
keep making mistakes,

59
00:03:30,486 -> 00:03:34,561
and this has been a
mischief at will

60
00:03:35,154 -> 00:03:37,389
"Believe me, ah was a mistake
King of Shadows ..

61
00:03:37,390 -> 00:03:41,445
.. For he said, would recognize the man
by the Athenian garments to wear? "

62
00:03:41,446 -> 00:03:43,966
".. And so far blame
prove my innocence

63
00:03:43,967 -> 00:03:47,686
it and seen a
Athenian in his eyes, and so far ..

64
00:03:47,748 -> 00:03:51,638
What did you go from having no lines
ah be the principal of a work?

65
00:03:51,639 -> 00:03:53,760
That's great!.
Not really a musical?

66
00:03:53,762 -> 00:03:55,112
-No
"That's great!

67
00:03:55,756 -> 00:03:57,293
hey! do a fairy!

68
00:03:57,294 -> 00:04:00,680
Not just any fairy Reese!
Is the most important work!

69
00:04:00,681 -> 00:04:01,681
I'm so proud of you

70
00:04:02,549 -> 00:04:04,946
rehearse every night
you have to take at 5

71
00:04:04,947 -> 00:04:05,987
"Every night?!

72
00:04:05,988 -> 00:04:08,278
oh, and put up the set
weekends

73
00:04:08,279 -> 00:04:09,709
well, we can do

74
00:04:09,710 -> 00:04:11,988
if I can go to work early
leave early

75
00:04:11,989 -> 00:04:14,395
to carry you and then
Reese to the practice of jockey

76
00:04:14,396 -> 00:04:16,063
Less days
Reese is punishable

77
00:04:16,064 -> 00:04:17,283
And Dewey left alone

78
00:04:17,284 -> 00:04:20,302
I can take care, I will arrange my
schedule for a couple of weeks

79
00:04:20,525 -> 00:04:22,350
It will be fun to spend
time together

80
00:04:22,351 -> 00:04:24,746
Can we run over things
the car like last time?

81
00:04:27,384 -> 00:04:29,229
He was already dead

82
00:04:30,116 -> 00:04:32,034
I'm guacamole
very good Joe

83
00:04:32,035 -> 00:04:33,035
Thanks

84
00:04:33,036 -> 00:04:35,183
the secret is juice
fresh lime

85
00:04:35,969 -> 00:04:37,573
Commander in front!

86
00:04:38,470 -> 00:04:41,511
no, please.
do not let that bother

87
00:04:41,512 -> 00:04:43,155
make yourselves at home

88
00:04:44,924 -> 00:04:46,433
A moment!

89
00:04:47,595 -> 00:04:50,455
This is not your home!

90
00:04:51,734 -> 00:04:55,809
This is not mom's house!

91
00:04:57,230 -> 00:05:00,657
there is an employee
to gather their toys

92
00:05:00,658 -> 00:05:03,698
and yet, looking
this institution of learning

93
00:05:03,699 -> 00:05:07,079
see video games
I see women's magazines

94
00:05:07,080 -> 00:05:08,493
and see Garf ...

95
00:05:09,751 -> 00:05:15,132
Garf Vader, desecrating our
Wall memorial

96
00:05:16,518 -> 00:05:20,555
Clearly things have
a little crazy here

97
00:05:20,556 -> 00:05:23,633
I blame you, but you
are those who suffer

98
00:05:23,634 -> 00:05:26,505
From today there will be
weekly inspections

99
00:05:26,706 -> 00:05:32,645
and renounce all personal affection
that does not comply with regulations

100
00:05:32,646 -> 00:05:37,123
It's time to learn that
True happiness comes from within

101
00:05:37,706 -> 00:05:39,678
Why so happy that Lord?

102
00:05:40,739 -> 00:05:44,101
I'm as happy as a
Schoolgirl, Cadet

103
00:05:44,856 -> 00:05:48,134
well, spaghetti, cleaner and
costume glitter for Malcolm

104
00:05:48,135 -> 00:05:49,414
I think that's all

105
00:05:49,415 -> 00:05:51,164
Oh my god! Is this thing right?

106
00:05:51,165 -> 00:05:53,299
- What time do you have?
- 5:45

107
00:05:53,300 -> 00:05:54,300
"5:45!?

108
00:05:55,356 -> 00:05:57,185
It is not possible ..

109
00:05:57,186 -> 00:06:00,295
Take Malcolm, Reese picked up
Dinner is in the oven

110
00:06:03,599 -> 00:06:04,880
What happens?

111
00:06:05,445 -> 00:06:08,011
I've got 25 minutes free

112
00:06:08,442 -> 00:06:12,154
How do you do that?
Did you leave any child out there?

113
00:06:12,408 -> 00:06:15,696
not, are all in place

114
00:06:17,418 -> 00:06:20,202
- What you gonna do?
- Do not Know

115
00:06:24,372 -> 00:06:25,771
- Do not Know

116
00:06:27,307 -> 00:06:30,822
- And this goes here?
- Yes, and you're all

117
00:06:31,438 -> 00:06:33,305
ah, leave English

118
00:06:33,306 -> 00:06:37,163
this is great, never seen as
in the box when I do it alone

119
00:06:37,439 -> 00:06:38,944
I feel the same

120
00:06:38,945 -> 00:06:41,006
We make good team

121
00:06:44,530 -> 00:06:48,221
well, begins with the street
principal and I with the university

122
00:06:48,222 -> 00:06:50,694
and see you at the bar at noon

123
00:06:59,194 -> 00:07:02,663
- Would you like a massage?
- Do not Know

124
00:07:03,135 -> 00:07:07,976
- I'm not a fan of massage
- Only take 15 minutes

125
00:07:08,497 -> 00:07:09,689
Well

126
00:07:09,898 -> 00:07:11,815
I have some time

127
00:07:13,567 -> 00:07:15,918
But I do not take away the blouse ..

128
00:07:15,941 -> 00:07:20,172
and I warn you, I never hypnotized
relax and have achieved

129
00:07:26,927 -> 00:07:28,452
that feels really ...

130
00:07:30,713 -> 00:07:31,893
feel ..

131
00:07:33,163 -> 00:07:34,500
well

132
00:07:45,937 -> 00:07:47,795
<i> convicted of an honest love </ i>

133
00:07:47,796 -> 00:07:50,257
<i> should we view
show love </ i>

134
00:07:50,258 -> 00:07:53,469
<i> Lord, how foolish
these mortals are! "</ i>

135
00:07:53,470 -> 00:07:55,699
I'm very upset
Malcolm you

136
00:07:56,576 -> 00:07:59,154
I do that this amount

137
00:07:59,729 -> 00:08:03,078
-Malcolm that was wonderful!
- I hope to be as good as you!

138
00:08:03,079 -> 00:08:07,369
if you are so good now
As you can imagine 15

139
00:08:07,370 -> 00:08:10,253
and imagine how beautiful
is when you have 15

140
00:08:12,008 -> 00:08:14,066
oh no, did I giggle?

141
00:08:14,067 -> 00:08:17,054
Did ... giggle

142
00:08:17,269 -> 00:08:19,230
"Stevie, are you doing here?

143
00:08:19,231 -> 00:08:22,349
missed you ... the meeting

144
00:08:23,202 -> 00:08:25,331
these ponies ...

145
00:08:25,332 -> 00:08:27,422
... Do in game

146
00:08:28,309 -> 00:08:30,198
project

147
00:08:31,072 -> 00:08:33,541
Great, see you in class

148
00:08:34,488 -> 00:08:36,587
Why not skip
directly from high school?

149
00:08:36,588 -> 00:08:38,498
I have told you
socially delayed

150
00:08:38,499 -> 00:08:39,743
but I think that is a lie

151
00:08:42,423 -> 00:08:44,545
But Lord, is a
picture of my sister!

152
00:08:44,546 -> 00:08:49,594
To you is your sister.
For others, it is a distraction

153
00:08:49,595 -> 00:08:53,938
Now, if you need more
I will give details

154
00:08:54,205 -> 00:08:56,678
How long has
Cadet sideburns?

155
00:08:58,690 -> 00:09:00,217
It's crazy!

156
00:09:00,218 -> 00:09:02,607
Even prisoners can
take pictures

157
00:09:02,608 -> 00:09:05,680
Spangler trying to take everything
remind us that we are human

158
00:09:05,681 -> 00:09:07,751
Francis, do not cause problems

159
00:09:07,752 -> 00:09:09,039
I do not care!

160
00:09:09,040 -> 00:09:12,872
It's time to step forward by
our rights and our freedom!

161
00:09:20,192 -> 00:09:22,411
Malcolm, Reese. apresurence!

162
00:09:23,322 -> 00:09:26,079
For god Hal!
When will clean this up?

163
00:09:26,080 -> 00:09:27,707
Malcolm Reese, go!

164
00:09:27,708 -> 00:09:29,818
Honey, I promised Dewey
spend time with

165
00:09:29,819 -> 00:09:31,683
This must have cost a fortune!

166
00:09:31,684 -> 00:09:33,764
We'll talk about this later

167
00:09:33,765 -> 00:09:36,331
Some have
things to do!

168
00:09:40,517 -> 00:09:44,168
Dewey, I believe that our small
community needs a school

169
00:09:44,169 -> 00:09:47,217
No need, all
born smart

170
00:09:47,381 -> 00:09:50,906
Oh, that's very sweet child
Utopia is a

171
00:09:50,907 -> 00:09:53,889
and if someone is born stupid
is used as food

172
00:09:53,890 -> 00:09:54,890
ah ...

173
00:09:55,189 -> 00:09:57,125
Utopia cannibal

174
00:09:57,230 -> 00:09:58,126
interesting ..

175
00:10:06,839 -> 00:10:08,166
Are you still here?

176
00:10:08,621 -> 00:10:10,915
I was doing some shopping y. ..

177
00:10:11,072 -> 00:10:13,135
and I thought, as I'm here ...
you know

178
00:10:13,136 -> 00:10:15,213
I thought in passing to say hello

179
00:10:19,601 -> 00:10:24,205
oh, my god ... How do you do?

180
00:10:24,206 -> 00:10:26,365
Points of relaxation

181
00:10:26,366 -> 00:10:30,095
It relaxes the mind

182
00:10:30,096 -> 00:10:33,568
This relaxes the heart

183
00:10:33,735 -> 00:10:38,969
and you know ...
What is what it does?

184
00:10:46,874 -> 00:10:49,750
We ... to talk

185
00:10:49,751 -> 00:10:51,933
You missed the last 5 meetings

186
00:10:51,934 -> 00:10:54,508
and the proof is in less than 20 minutes

187
00:10:54,509 -> 00:10:56,264
Why do you hate us?

188
00:10:56,265 -> 00:10:58,626
Friends, do not hate

189
00:10:58,627 -> 00:11:00,326
Is that I've been busy

190
00:11:00,327 -> 00:11:01,677
We're still friends

191
00:11:01,678 -> 00:11:03,561
- Really?
- Claro

192
00:11:03,562 -> 00:11:05,182
Then is not
abandoned the project?

193
00:11:05,183 -> 00:11:07,214
- No!
- Then you have the latest information!

194
00:11:07,215 -> 00:11:10,521
Of course, after working all night
the test are on my desktop

195
00:11:13,096 -> 00:11:14,402
here have

196
00:11:15,364 -> 00:11:17,909
Others were
you doubters

197
00:11:18,070 -> 00:11:20,693
Malcolm hey!
Do you want a lift?

198
00:11:20,803 -> 00:11:22,133
I have to go

199
00:11:31,421 -> 00:11:34,269
This distracted
We have to do now!

200
00:11:35,508 -> 00:11:37,018
The program is
up

201
00:11:40,230 -> 00:11:42,558
Let's light this candle!

202
00:11:42,559 -> 00:11:44,310
Ignition ....

203
00:11:45,214 -> 00:11:46,338
in ...

204
00:11:48,279 -> 00:11:49,696
5 ...

205
00:11:52,582 -> 00:11:54,207
4 ...

206
00:11:54,208 -> 00:11:58,376
3 ...

207
00:12:03,252 -> 00:12:04,867
Liftoff!

208
00:12:06,282 -> 00:12:09,606
The path is
something strange

209
00:12:21,001 -> 00:12:24,073
Well, there are many reasons
for what might go wrong

210
00:12:24,074 -> 00:12:27,162
Where ... this?

211
00:12:33,500 -> 00:12:38,702
I work a lot
but I am taking delivery lessons

212
00:12:47,316 -> 00:12:48,637
We did a vote

213
00:12:48,638 -> 00:12:52,304
You wrong of the plant
we do not want problems with this nonsense

214
00:12:52,305 -> 00:12:55,063
no nonsense,
is an act of resistance

215
00:12:55,616 -> 00:12:57,294
It's a plant!

216
00:12:57,295 -> 00:12:59,942
Not about a plant!

217
00:12:59,943 -> 00:13:03,007
It's about fighting
tyranny and oppression!

218
00:13:03,113 -> 00:13:04,920
When Spangler's see ..

219
00:13:04,921 -> 00:13:07,618
know that our grief
spirit and it never will

220
00:13:07,619 -> 00:13:08,910
Not worth it!

221
00:13:09,807 -> 00:13:13,034
seems I'm again
the only man around here

222
00:13:14,624 -> 00:13:18,719
- I can not believe that Nicole is thus seen
if you want to look like whore is well ..

223
00:13:18,720 -> 00:13:21,898
- But that does not make me vomit
- I know, she wants to impress David

224
00:13:21,899 -> 00:13:25,477
But he is so interested
Brenda has no chance

225
00:13:25,478 -> 00:13:27,579
I can not believe how deep
these conversations are

226
00:13:27,580 -> 00:13:30,302
You will not believe what I heard about Josh
Can not say!

227
00:13:30,303 -> 00:13:33,382
- I heard it was your sister in the bathroom
- Your sister or half sister

228
00:13:33,383 -> 00:13:35,693
No, your sister, why
it can be in love

229
00:13:38,246 -> 00:13:41,577
- Do not talk about my right?
- No, we talked about Josh

230
00:13:41,578 -> 00:13:45,866
Oh my god! his father became
crazy when he saw his half sister

231
00:13:45,867 -> 00:13:48,792
but you know something
I do not know the whole story

232
00:13:49,168 -> 00:13:50,726
This is my entry!

233
00:13:51,247 -> 00:13:53,674
I feel bad for fun
and leave both my friends

234
00:13:53,675 -> 00:13:55,575
but surely
do well if my

235
00:13:55,576 -> 00:13:58,191
They are lucky that no one
I call the police

236
00:13:58,192 -> 00:14:01,564
Can not prove that there
relationship between rocket explosion

237
00:14:01,565 -> 00:14:03,816
and Caroline giving
parking light

238
00:14:04,236 -> 00:14:07,509
She and the baby are fine
thanks for asking

239
00:14:07,510 -> 00:14:08,769
and ....

240
00:14:08,770 -> 00:14:10,374
Rocket?

241
00:14:15,475 -> 00:14:18,799
oh god ... true!

242
00:14:28,802 -> 00:14:30,301
This completed

243
00:14:30,302 -> 00:14:32,233
A perfect society

244
00:14:32,234 -> 00:14:36,503
We accomplish what years of 5mil
civilization could not do

245
00:14:36,966 -> 00:14:39,528
We create a world
works

246
00:14:40,264 -> 00:14:41,238
Do we create?

247
00:14:47,610 -> 00:14:49,554
Want to destroy you?

248
00:14:49,555 -> 00:14:50,555
if

249
00:14:50,556 -> 00:14:53,103
Grateful
you would not

250
00:14:53,104 -> 00:14:55,172
You've held up very well

251
00:14:56,790 -> 00:14:59,420
Take it, enjoy it

252
00:15:01,753 -> 00:15:05,113
oh, dear, let us be
lead but this is it, I promise

253
00:15:05,114 -> 00:15:08,394
- Okay, go shopping
- Do not just go just now?

254
00:15:08,395 -> 00:15:09,612
yeah sure, no problem

255
00:15:17,195 -> 00:15:19,253
- Thanks
- Where is Mr. Lee?

256
00:15:19,254 -> 00:15:21,524
- Excuse me?
- The massages, where is?

257
00:15:21,525 -> 00:15:23,722
Oh, and do not work here

258
00:15:23,723 -> 00:15:27,253
How? is impossible!
he did not leave without telling me

259
00:15:27,254 -> 00:15:29,657
I can find
where he now works

260
00:15:29,658 -> 00:15:31,812
For me
abandonde again!

261
00:15:32,113 -> 00:15:33,377
Forget it!

262
00:15:33,378 -> 00:15:34,838
Just finished!

263
00:15:38,658 -> 00:15:42,382
I heard that Josh has a new piercing
and not in your ear or navel

264
00:15:42,383 -> 00:15:44,922
Julie will know, camp with fua
while her boyfriend was away

265
00:15:44,923 -> 00:15:48,140
Josh lead all camp
and tries to swim naked with

266
00:15:48,141 -> 00:15:50,035
But I do not think Josh
naked is stimulating

267
00:15:50,036 -> 00:15:52,499
You know, throw a party Deveria
-swimming pool at my house on Saturday

268
00:15:52,500 -> 00:15:53,966
- Malcolm want to go?
- Yes!

269
00:15:53,967 -> 00:15:56,827
wait, I have something
to do on Saturday

270
00:15:56,828 -> 00:15:58,315
Oh yeah, the work

271
00:16:03,858 -> 00:16:05,486
live, live ...

272
00:16:05,487 -> 00:16:06,487
Dies

273
00:16:07,500 -> 00:16:10,781
live, live, live ...

274
00:16:10,782 -> 00:16:11,782
Dies

275
00:16:12,675 -> 00:16:16,954
hey, what happened to the judicial system
directed by the court of wise men

276
00:16:17,052 -> 00:16:18,990
Send them Fucile

277
00:16:22,695 -> 00:16:27,076
- Son, I've spent a lot t..
- Silence! Capturenlo!

278
00:16:36,122 -> 00:16:40,593
well son, I think it's time
you go to bed

279
00:16:40,594 -> 00:16:44,885
Dad, I'm ashamed
in front of my men

280
00:16:46,351 -> 00:16:47,704
Hal!

281
00:16:48,005 -> 00:16:50,182
"Todabia is this here?

282
00:17:27,536 -> 00:17:30,211
No fair!
Did they do without me?!

283
00:17:32,226 -> 00:17:34,601
Comes Spangler
desaste plant

284
00:17:34,602 -> 00:17:36,913
Came the moment,
no turning back

285
00:17:36,914 -> 00:17:38,598
This is our Alamo

286
00:17:38,599 -> 00:17:41,454
is a bad example
but you get

287
00:17:41,455 -> 00:17:42,455
Firm!

288
00:17:46,361 -> 00:17:48,685
So I like

289
00:17:48,724 -> 00:17:53,021
Everything in perfect order
Commander entering

290
00:17:53,056 -> 00:17:58,002
and is greeted with backs straight
and gnashing of leather Sapatos

291
00:18:00,219 -> 00:18:03,225
and were
hard days

292
00:18:03,226 -> 00:18:05,559
but Acknowledge
that is better so

293
00:18:05,560 -> 00:18:08,863
We are a machine
that learning

294
00:18:09,872 -> 00:18:12,977
And some will believe
I'm a sadist

295
00:18:12,978 -> 00:18:15,197
but one day I
appreciate it

296
00:18:16,347 -> 00:18:20,543
friend, that was way too,
Can we do something that encourages you?

297
00:18:21,060 -> 00:18:23,462
Do you have more pictures
your sister?

298
00:18:23,840 -> 00:18:27,970
<i> "I brought curses eh
and brought me to love "</ i>

299
00:18:30,703 -> 00:18:33,191
Hal, stop
You're making it worse

300
00:18:38,240 -> 00:18:39,813
You okay, son?

301
00:18:46,098 -> 00:18:49,561
Why did we come from?
Malcolm betrayed us

302
00:18:49,562 -> 00:18:52,325
if you love something, let it go

303
00:18:52,326 -> 00:18:55,578
Keep your cheap philosophy
for other

304
00:18:56,548 -> 00:18:58,756
We ....

305
00:18:59,116 -> 00:19:01,060
right

306
00:19:02,676 -> 00:19:04,526
Do not have ended?

307
00:19:04,527 -> 00:19:08,660
No, just discussed and says
Andrew just go with the ball

308
00:19:08,661 -> 00:19:09,622
I can not believe ...

309
00:19:09,623 -> 00:19:12,591
<i> enough, the missing ...</ i>

310
00:19:12,592 -> 00:19:14,724
"That was my entry?
Fast, Bajamar

311
00:19:43,372 -> 00:19:44,980
It may be
one of those moments

312
00:19:44,981 -> 00:19:47,661
in passing a few seconds
and feels like an eternity

313
00:19:47,662 -> 00:19:50,922
Malcolm Why do not ah
said anything in 5 minutes?

314
00:19:55,752 -> 00:19:57,246
My online ...

315
00:19:57,247 -> 00:20:01,581
Normally I would enjoy something like that
but this is very sad

316
00:20:03,322 -> 00:20:05,824
"O spirit, where're heading"

323
