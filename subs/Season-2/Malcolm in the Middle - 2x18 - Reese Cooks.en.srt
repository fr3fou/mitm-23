1
00:00:06,971 -> 00:00:08,591
I had a nightmare.

2
00:00:09,151 -> 00:00:11,331
Okay, honey.
Ven.

3
00:00:12,560 -> 00:00:14,671
Come on, okay.

4
00:00:17,450 -> 00:00:18,880
What was your dream?

5
00:00:19,440 -> 00:00:22,460
I dreamed I was a man

6
00:00:23,280 -> 00:00:24,940
out the door

7
00:00:26,200 -> 00:00:27,620
with a large knife

8
00:00:28,899 -> 00:00:30,830
I wanted to be tied to all

9
00:00:31,940 -> 00:00:33,080
and kill

10
00:00:34,044 -> 00:00:35,530
eat your eyes

11
00:00:37,560 -> 00:00:39,240
everyone.

12
00:00:45,772 -> 00:00:53,480

14
00:01:17,215 -> 00:01:18,618
Hey, what are you doing, son?

15
00:01:18,837 -> 00:01:21,095
I have to prove the Third Law
Kepler planet motion.

16
00:01:22,905 -> 00:01:23,815
What are you doing Dewey?

17
00:01:23,815 -> 00:01:24,905
Is coloring.

18
00:01:24,905 -> 00:01:26,575
Best help him.

19
00:01:27,525 -> 00:01:28,245
Dad!

20
00:01:28,245 -> 00:01:30,606
A madman is saying that he did
horrible things

21
00:01:30,606 -> 00:01:32,085
But not quite understand.

22
00:01:32,405 -> 00:01:34,035
I think it escaped from a mental hospital.

23
00:01:34,785 -> 00:01:35,995
I heard nothing.

24
00:01:40,503 -> 00:01:42,366
Hello again, Hal

25
00:01:44,668 -> 00:01:47,354
Not leaving this house, except for
school for a month!

26
00:01:48,755 -> 00:01:49,224
Well.

27
00:01:49,224 -> 00:01:51,194
Wait a minute, honey.
You have to go outside.

28
00:01:51,194 -> 00:01:52,484
Has not cut the grass
since his last punishment

29
00:01:52,484 -> 00:01:54,964
Oh, I think to stay inside without TV
is worse than mowing.

30
00:01:55,454 -> 00:01:56,714
And do not let me watch TV.

31
00:01:57,394 -> 00:01:58,004
Really?

32
00:01:58,004 -> 00:01:59,364
Okay. Well.

33
00:01:59,364 -> 00:02:02,874
No TV. Without going outside, except
lawn, you will do at night.

34
00:02:04,174 -> 00:02:05,604
Inside.

35
00:02:07,125 -> 00:02:09,344
How long will the punishment?

36
00:02:09,344 -> 00:02:12,688
Just go to your room.
Your father and I have to figure this out.

37
00:02:15,084 -> 00:02:16,544
We can not control it.

38
00:02:17,383 -> 00:02:18,564
What else can we do?

39
00:02:18,564 -> 00:02:21,984
We remove the television, video games,
music, fresh air.

40
00:02:22,644 -> 00:02:26,024
Lois, we have removed the fresh air and
did not care anything about that.

41
00:02:26,364 -> 00:02:29,703
Well you better think of something before
turn out to be a problem for the state.

42
00:02:30,584 -> 00:02:33,404
Maybe we should interted else
in addition to punishment.

43
00:02:33,663 -> 00:02:34,274
Like what?

44
00:02:34,274 -> 00:02:37,604
Maybe Reese needs attention.
Positive attention.

45
00:02:38,314 -> 00:02:43,234
When I was your age I always wanted someone with
talk to or be, or be modeled.

46
00:02:43,634 -> 00:02:45,104
I do not know.

47
00:02:45,353 -> 00:02:47,674
Lois, this boy needs
a father figure.

48
00:02:47,674 -> 00:02:49,173
And I really think it should be me.

49
00:02:52,013 -> 00:02:53,133
Cintia What are you doing?

50
00:02:53,133 -> 00:02:54,422
We thought you'd know.

51
00:02:54,804 -> 00:02:56,043
Because of their relationship.

52
00:02:56,344 -> 00:02:57,943
We do not have a relationship.

53
00:02:58,443 -> 00:03:01,564
OK ... feel.

54
00:03:02,533 -> 00:03:03,523
Shut up.

55
00:03:03,853 -> 00:03:07,743
Hey guys, here.
I'll do a barbecue this weekend.

56
00:03:08,223 -> 00:03:11,392
Do not lose your invitations, because my dad
not leave without them.

57
00:03:12,293 -> 00:03:17,942
A party ... a real party
and not created by my imagination.

58
00:03:18,172 -> 00:03:19,263
Is it your birthday?

59
00:03:19,263 -> 00:03:20,853
No, just to socialize ...

60
00:03:21,393 -> 00:03:22,403
You know, it's weird.

61
00:03:22,403 -> 00:03:25,273
I've been his friend for a month and a half and you
are the only friends I have.

62
00:03:25,625 -> 00:03:26,523
You're kidding.

63
00:03:26,852 -> 00:03:28,044
Seriously.

64
00:03:28,333 -> 00:03:32,292
It must be hard for you to believe, but
Some people find it difficult to make friends.

65
00:03:35,152 -> 00:03:37,325
PLEASE BE MY FRIEND!

66
00:03:37,552 -> 00:03:39,532
Cynthia, are you sure you want ...?

67
00:03:39,752 -> 00:03:41,232
I wish I had thought of that!

68
00:03:41,232 -> 00:03:43,082
I know, is so cool.

69
00:03:43,292 -> 00:03:45,442
And finally I will make some friends.

70
00:03:46,382 -> 00:03:47,842
What do you think, Malcolm?

71
00:03:47,842 -> 00:03:50,952
Sounds great ... must be ... party

72
00:03:51,742 -> 00:03:53,972
Cross your fingers.

73
00:03:53,972 -> 00:03:54,978
Yes!

74
00:03:56,382 -> 00:03:57,252
Hi Eric, How are you?

75
00:03:57,722 -> 00:04:02,552
You just lost your third
term view of history, Francis.

76
00:04:03,262 -> 00:04:07,059
I will not go to summer school just because
my friend ruined his half of the project.

77
00:04:07,264 -> 00:04:09,572
Did you get my half?
I put it under the door

78
00:04:09,572 -> 00:04:11,382
Is this your half?

79
00:04:11,752 -> 00:04:12,551
Sure.

80
00:04:12,991 -> 00:04:14,602
This is my half!

81
00:04:15,522 -> 00:04:19,841
If you knew you were going to exaggerate both, I would have spent
a little more time to my section.

82
00:04:20,201 -> 00:04:23,351
Photocopying a page from the dictionary ...

83
00:04:24,052 -> 00:04:26,792
Okay, I was wrong.
There is still time.

84
00:04:27,591 -> 00:04:28,847
How soon is it?

85
00:04:28,847 -> 00:04:29,891
For 20.

86
00:04:29,891 -> 00:04:31,981
And are you worried?

87
00:04:31,981 -> 00:04:33,226
We have over a week.

88
00:04:33,226 -> 00:04:34,751
My half it took me two weeks.

89
00:04:34,751 -> 00:04:37,581
Okay, I guess I must strive and
have it ready by then.

90
00:04:38,371 -> 00:04:42,521
Okay. Go to the library to find books.
Stay here and organize your notes.

91
00:04:42,521 -> 00:04:43,851
It's a good plan.

92
00:04:49,591 -> 00:04:53,861
18 degrees. Perfect temperature for writing.

93
00:04:54,757 -> 00:04:55,911
Let's do it.

94
00:04:57,121 -> 00:04:59,070
I just wanted to spend time with me ...

95
00:04:59,070 -> 00:05:00,101
That's right.

96
00:05:00,101 -> 00:05:01,881
So it's not a punishment?

97
00:05:01,881 -> 00:05:03,571
No.
Why do you ask?

98
00:05:04,001 -> 00:05:06,061
Because you're still looking at me and saying things ...

99
00:05:06,371 -> 00:05:07,891
I am by lending attention.

100
00:05:08,100 -> 00:05:09,810
But Dad ... "A cooking class?

101
00:05:10,230 -> 00:05:11,521
Reese, open your mind ...

102
00:05:11,521 -> 00:05:14,250
The art of cooking is so manly
as any of these courses.

103
00:05:14,490 -> 00:05:16,780
Judo, Kick boxing ...

104
00:05:16,780 -> 00:05:18,450
Anyone can fight

105
00:05:18,680 -> 00:05:21,830
but it takes a real man
achieve true bolognese.

106
00:05:22,161 -> 00:05:25,250
I am still troubled.

107
00:05:36,840 -> 00:05:38,400
Hi, Cintia

108
00:05:38,680 -> 00:05:40,650
We do not know, but I'll do a party.

109
00:05:40,900 -> 00:05:43,128
Do you see that says the eight question mark?

110
00:05:43,128 -> 00:05:45,839
Means you can go to infinity.

111
00:05:46,899 -> 00:05:48,180
See ya.

112
00:05:49,040 -> 00:05:50,330
Hi, I'm Cindy.

113
00:05:50,330 -> 00:05:52,070
We do not know, but I'll do a party ...

114
00:05:52,070 -> 00:05:53,730
What are you doing?
Do you invite the whole school?

115
00:05:53,730 -> 00:05:55,370
Sorry, I can not talk now.

116
00:05:55,370 -> 00:05:57,640
I keep my topics of conversation for the party.

117
00:05:58,520 -> 00:06:02,099
For example, there is a new article in the booth
New England medical this month ...

118
00:06:02,099 -> 00:06:04,280
Hey, that's my issue.

119
00:06:04,799 -> 00:06:12,110
I hope ... my wheelchair ...
enter the ... closet kisses.

120
00:06:12,799 -> 00:06:14,139
I hope you come hungry.

121
00:06:14,139 -> 00:06:17,930
Serve-shaped cookies
famous communist revolutionary

122
00:06:18,398 -> 00:06:19,929
Hi, I'm Cindy.

123
00:06:19,929 -> 00:06:22,789
Cynthia, "I can talk to you for one second?

124
00:06:22,789 -> 00:06:24,029
Sure.

125
00:06:24,029 -> 00:06:25,509
Tell all your friends!

126
00:06:26,279 -> 00:06:28,059
How many people you invited
your party?

127
00:06:28,059 -> 00:06:29,270
God, who knows?

128
00:06:29,270 -> 00:06:32,609
I left some invitations in the library and
some in the game ...

129
00:06:32,919 -> 00:06:35,639
I would appreciate the
personal touch, you know.

130
00:06:35,639 -> 00:06:38,119
So they can match a face to face.

131
00:06:38,799 -> 00:06:40,439
Do not think you're exaggerating?

132
00:06:41,019 -> 00:06:42,309
What are you talking about?

133
00:06:42,309 -> 00:06:44,498
I fear that you prepare a big disappointment.

134
00:06:44,919 -> 00:06:47,029
I mean, when 10 people
will not is a shame.

135
00:06:47,029 -> 00:06:49,839
But when 300 people do not
van is a total humiliation.

136
00:06:50,118 -> 00:06:52,379
Well, I guess
many people will be present.

137
00:06:52,799 -> 00:06:54,799
Cynthia, you are a Krelboyne.

138
00:06:54,799 -> 00:06:56,687
The parties do Krelboyne Krelboyne.

139
00:06:57,089 -> 00:06:59,378
You do not know how many friends I can do.

140
00:06:59,378 -> 00:07:00,898
Yes, I know.
Zero.

141
00:07:01,109 -> 00:07:02,438
Just like the rest of us.

142
00:07:02,438 -> 00:07:04,108
Cintia, nobody will come to your party.

143
00:07:04,438 -> 00:07:05,968
Oh yeah?
Just so you know

144
00:07:06,228 -> 00:07:10,148
established a new record
invitations rolled.

145
00:07:10,568 -> 00:07:11,817
So what?

146
00:07:11,817 -> 00:07:13,270
That does not mean anything.

147
00:07:13,528 -> 00:07:15,103
I know that this is all about.
You're just jealous.

148
00:07:15,748 -> 00:07:16,618
Jealous?

149
00:07:16,618 -> 00:07:18,908
Obviously make friends
not easy for you.

150
00:07:18,908 -> 00:07:23,028
So you hide in your circle safe while
People like me do festivals

151
00:07:23,028 -> 00:07:25,168
and make many friends and enjoy
of life.

152
00:07:27,427 -> 00:07:29,538
Bitter.
What a surprise!

153
00:07:32,128 -> 00:07:38,563
The trick is to support rapid cutting knife
on the knuckles and lifting ...

154
00:07:39,815 -> 00:07:42,438
Who cut it?

155
00:07:42,698 -> 00:07:44,087
I did.

156
00:07:46,428 -> 00:07:48,078
Let's look again.

157
00:07:53,667 -> 00:07:55,528
Oh, my god!

158
00:07:55,987 -> 00:07:59,587
In fact, these pieces are
a bit more consistent than yours.

159
00:08:00,265 -> 00:08:02,727
You say you never cooked anything before?

160
00:08:03,097 -> 00:08:04,697
Was it intentional?
No.

161
00:08:05,257 -> 00:08:07,057
Admirable.

162
00:08:08,957 -> 00:08:10,837
Sit and listen.

163
00:08:11,057 -> 00:08:12,367
I'm sick of this.

164
00:08:12,617 -> 00:08:14,509
And spent two days and no
did any work.

165
00:08:14,887 -> 00:08:17,647
And I can not believe I've
persuaded to see that movie.

166
00:08:17,647 -> 00:08:18,458
I know.

167
00:08:18,458 -> 00:08:20,746
I begin to question everything that genre
of talking dogs.

168
00:08:21,187 -> 00:08:24,607
You know what will make us forget that movie?
Another round of miniature golf.

169
00:08:24,837 -> 00:08:26,405
No.
No more miniature golf.

170
00:08:26,405 -> 00:08:27,297
You have to get to work.

171
00:08:28,726 -> 00:08:29,477
Right.

172
00:08:29,477 -> 00:08:30,657
Sure.

173
00:08:30,657 -> 00:08:31,996
Let's do it.

174
00:08:31,996 -> 00:08:33,877
These two books are of war

175
00:08:33,877 -> 00:08:38,036
It will be easy because your part
deals with the reconstruction.

176
00:08:38,036 -> 00:08:39,227
Okay.

177
00:08:39,227 -> 00:08:40,606
I do not know what you mean.

178
00:08:40,606 -> 00:08:41,616
But I will,

179
00:08:41,616 -> 00:08:43,536
because they do not leave here
in the next 10 hours.

180
00:08:43,786 -> 00:08:45,676
That's what I like to listen.

181
00:08:46,276 -> 00:08:48,831
Now, before I go
Need something?

182
00:08:48,831 -> 00:08:50,276
I do not want to leave the room.

183
00:08:50,276 -> 00:08:52,496
No. Do not bother me.
I try to study.

184
00:09:09,190 -> 00:09:11,811
All right, Harvey.
See if you can break the record of Brian.

185
00:09:11,811 -> 00:09:13,941
You have to do it in a
hour and four minutes.

186
00:09:16,304 -> 00:09:17,436
Now!

187
00:09:19,309 -> 00:09:20,871
Sorry I'm late.

188
00:09:21,100 -> 00:09:23,790
Craig angered some boys and
made me accompany him to his car.

189
00:09:24,331 -> 00:09:26,039
I will make dinner in a second.

190
00:09:34,119 -> 00:09:35,206
Well?

191
00:09:35,206 -> 00:09:36,449
It's hot.

192
00:09:36,449 -> 00:09:38,062
And it needs another laurel.

193
00:09:39,940 -> 00:09:40,950
Just look at it.

194
00:09:40,950 -> 00:09:45,200
After testing the chocolate souffle,
class gave him a standing ovation.

195
00:09:45,200 -> 00:09:46,770
To Reese?

196
00:09:46,770 -> 00:09:47,820
Yes!

197
00:09:47,820 -> 00:09:49,760
Dewey, do you think soup is for Juliana?

198
00:09:49,760 -> 00:09:51,570
I think so.

199
00:09:51,570 -> 00:09:53,041
Go check the Bioche.

200
00:09:53,960 -> 00:09:55,690
The bread in the oven?

201
00:09:56,040 -> 00:09:57,230
Ahhh.

202
00:09:58,000 -> 00:09:59,488
Dad?

203
00:09:59,760 -> 00:10:02,240
Just wanted you to know how
cooking class means to me.

204
00:10:02,450 -> 00:10:06,270
If I'd scored, I never would
known something so stupid

205
00:10:06,270 -> 00:10:08,579
could be so fun.

206
00:10:09,230 -> 00:10:10,969
Thanks

207
00:10:14,380 -> 00:10:17,779
Oh, come on.
That should make you feel good.

208
00:10:21,589 -> 00:10:24,029
Ohh, look at Malcolm surrounded
friends.

209
00:10:24,249 -> 00:10:26,849
I wonder what to social success.

210
00:10:27,249 -> 00:10:29,239
What do you think No. 1 invisible friend?

211
00:10:29,499 -> 00:10:30,409
Leave me alone.

212
00:10:30,409 -> 00:10:32,069
There you go again, pushing away people.

213
00:10:32,269 -> 00:10:33,441
Do you know Malcolm?

214
00:10:33,441 -> 00:10:35,629
If you want to make friends
should strive.

215
00:10:35,959 -> 00:10:37,498
Yes, you're right.
I'll work on that.

216
00:10:37,498 -> 00:10:38,669
See ya!

217
00:10:38,669 -> 00:10:40,148
It's sad, really.

218
00:10:40,148 -> 00:10:41,929
I feel sorry for you.

219
00:10:41,929 -> 00:10:44,409
You know what?
I have a great idea.

220
00:10:44,409 -> 00:10:47,669
Es .. is perfect.
You out of your protective shell.

221
00:10:47,889 -> 00:10:49,059
What are you talking about?

222
00:10:49,059 -> 00:10:51,539
You will be the host of the party with me!
Vamos!

223
00:10:51,539 -> 00:10:52,628
No!

224
00:10:52,628 -> 00:10:54,960
Hi, I'm Cindy and he is Malcolm.

225
00:10:54,960 -> 00:10:57,558
Give a party
this weekend.

226
00:10:57,558 -> 00:10:58,479
Go!

227
00:10:58,479 -> 00:11:00,509
And we have a musical invitation to you.

228
00:11:01,099 -> 00:11:04,618
Must come to the party
fun ... fun ...

229
00:11:04,618 -> 00:11:07,478
Must come to the party to have fun ...

230
00:11:07,478 -> 00:11:09,104
Okay.
You made me do this.

231
00:11:12,039 -> 00:11:14,288
Can not think of a better place
to kiss me?

232
00:11:14,659 -> 00:11:15,948
Here, read this.

233
00:11:16,158 -> 00:11:17,368
Malcolm, are you crazy?

234
00:11:17,368 -> 00:11:18,308
Lee!

235
00:11:20,258 -> 00:11:21,628
That is the wall of Krelboyne.

236
00:11:21,628 -> 00:11:23,528
As you can see,
are well represented.

237
00:11:24,467 -> 00:11:26,198
This is my section and that of Lloyd.

238
00:11:26,478 -> 00:11:28,888
But in terms of volume,
We have the advantage.

239
00:11:29,708 -> 00:11:31,818
Now you understand why
can not do this event?

240
00:11:36,438 -> 00:11:39,698
But ... is ridiculous ...
you will not believe what he says here. Right?

241
00:11:46,598 -> 00:11:50,018
Very ... refined.

242
00:11:54,838 -> 00:11:55,988
Have you seen Cynthia?

243
00:11:56,288 -> 00:11:58,617
No, but maybe you can
resolve this debate.

244
00:11:59,317 -> 00:12:00,668
Brown or bage.

245
00:12:01,168 -> 00:12:02,638
What are you talking about?

246
00:12:02,638 -> 00:12:04,737
As for the costume party.

247
00:12:04,797 -> 00:12:05,997
Hello everyone.

248
00:12:05,997 -> 00:12:07,700
Oh, Cindy, wanted to apologize.

249
00:12:07,700 -> 00:12:09,217
There is no reason to apologize, Malcolm.

250
00:12:09,217 -> 00:12:10,440
Here you go.

251
00:12:10,440 -> 00:12:11,987
I am canceling my party.

252
00:12:11,987 -> 00:12:13,707
These are uninvited.

253
00:12:13,707 -> 00:12:15,777
No huddle, there is one for
each of you.

254
00:12:16,137 -> 00:12:18,617
Malcolm opened my eyes
the fact that I am

255
00:12:18,617 -> 00:12:22,927
a sappy ugly and no reason to expect
someone attending my party.

256
00:12:23,248 -> 00:12:24,977
did not want to tell you so.
Sorry.

257
00:12:24,447 -> 00:12:27,777
you should not regret it.
I should thank you.

258
00:12:28,337 -> 00:12:30,057
Thanks Malcolm.

259
00:12:30,117 -> 00:12:30,647
Cintia, I ...

260
00:12:30,947 -> 00:12:31,756
You know what?

261
00:12:31,856 -> 00:12:36,996
I have a limit to mourn every day
Just the sight and makes me mourn,

262
00:12:37,267 -> 00:12:41,047
so if you do not mind, I
go now.

263
00:12:44,947 -> 00:12:46,048
Okay.

264
00:12:46,248 -> 00:12:47,946
No more distractions, Francis.

265
00:12:48,116 -> 00:12:50,047
I'm tired of yell.

266
00:12:50,717 -> 00:12:52,922
I'm not saying that the last race
Harvey was not exciting.

267
00:12:53,227 -> 00:12:54,387
You did not kill him, you know?

268
00:12:54,387 -> 00:12:56,816
Yes
I had to.

269
00:12:57,157 -> 00:13:00,206
Now, please, as
friends, just concentrate.

270
00:13:00,458 -> 00:13:02,616
Sorry.
I know I get distracted.

271
00:13:02,616 -> 00:13:05,406
But I always deadlines
manage to finish it.

272
00:13:05,606 -> 00:13:08,306
Okay.
See you in 30 minutes.

273
00:13:09,716 -> 00:13:12,166
You'd better bring it.

274
00:13:12,166 -> 00:13:13,748
Why?

275
00:14:10,834 -> 00:14:12,365
I can not really believe that
did this.

276
00:14:14,015 -> 00:14:15,135
You know what, Dad?

277
00:14:15,305 -> 00:14:17,985
When you try something,
shows.

278
00:14:18,735 -> 00:14:20,965
Yes, son.
That's right.

279
00:14:22,914 -> 00:14:26,995
Class, during our next session
there will be a competition.

280
00:14:27,117 -> 00:14:29,524
Friends and family are invited to attend.

281
00:14:29,714 -> 00:14:34,745
And do not be discouraged if they feel overshadowed by
one of our most promising students.

282
00:14:35,654 -> 00:14:36,914
We all come to have fun.

283
00:14:37,014 -> 00:14:38,345
What will I get if I win?

284
00:14:38,545 -> 00:14:41,984
A 18 cm knife and
a bread clip.

285
00:14:43,202 -> 00:14:44,451
Amazing.

286
00:14:48,984 -> 00:14:50,034
"I can help?

287
00:14:50,244 -> 00:14:53,094
Hi, Malcolm.
I do not know if you remember me.

288
00:14:53,094 -> 00:14:54,334
Not sure.

289
00:14:54,334 -> 00:14:57,424
I have a vague recollection that threw
a brick through the window of my daughter

290
00:14:57,424 -> 00:15:01,614
And I think you're the guy who ruined his party
and humiliated in a public restroom.

291
00:15:02,164 -> 00:15:03,464
How do I?

292
00:15:03,905 -> 00:15:05,144
Now if you do not mind.

293
00:15:05,144 -> 00:15:07,044
Okay, Dad.

294
00:15:11,394 -> 00:15:14,553
Great, the party is a success
Do not you listen?

295
00:15:15,424 -> 00:15:17,564
What are you doing here, Malcolm?

296
00:15:17,863 -> 00:15:20,583
I do not talk in school
do not answer my calls.

297
00:15:20,413 -> 00:15:22,503
I just want to say I'm sorry.

298
00:15:22,653 -> 00:15:25,075
Well, you want to ease your guilt?

299
00:15:26,343 -> 00:15:27,468
You are acquitted.

300
00:15:27,753 -> 00:15:28,883
Let me finish.

301
00:15:29,613 -> 00:15:32,193
'm Not telling you the truth.

302
00:15:32,423 -> 00:15:35,983
You were just preparing a major disaster
you did your party.

303
00:15:36,373 -> 00:15:39,243
Just wished I had been kinder.

304
00:15:39,483 -> 00:15:42,463
What's so nice to tell someone
it is a social delayed?

305
00:15:42,663 -> 00:15:43,973
You see my problem?

306
00:15:45,033 -> 00:15:49,653
But even if you did not say a sappy,
're smart, funny, interesting and friendly

307
00:15:49,853 -> 00:15:53,293
and a unique person
and if people do not see it, is your problem.

308
00:15:55,973 -> 00:16:00,453
So how did you learn to deal
the school will laugh at you?

309
00:16:00,353 -> 00:16:01,902
In the same way with everything.

310
00:16:02,102 -> 00:16:05,262
I pretend I do not mind and bothers
people who do not deserve it.

311
00:16:05,162 -> 00:16:06,613
It seems to work.

312
00:16:07,592 -> 00:16:08,993
Want to join?

313
00:16:12,942 -> 00:16:14,162
"I can help?

314
00:16:14,572 -> 00:16:16,352
Yes, we come to the party of Cindy.

315
00:16:16,552 -> 00:16:18,182
We found these at the library.

316
00:16:19,052 -> 00:16:20,771
I just sent uninvited.

317
00:16:20,971 -> 00:16:22,972
I thought you said nobody would come.

318
00:16:23,595 -> 00:16:26,102
Come in, I think.

319
00:16:35,912 -> 00:16:37,222
I believe that truth will win.

320
00:16:37,401 -> 00:16:39,571
I hope to try anything
that has been cooked.

321
00:16:47,692 -> 00:16:52,702
Reese, this is the best I've ever tasted Kich.
What gives it that something extra?

322
00:16:52,802 -> 00:16:55,831
Old Spice Lotion hazelnuts
before roasting.

323
00:16:55,881 -> 00:16:56,818
"Old Spice?

324
00:16:56,782 -> 00:16:58,871
Yes, I would combine with the ricotta.

325
00:16:59,121 -> 00:17:00,472
Extraordinary.

326
00:17:06,962 -> 00:17:08,781
How much salt did you use?

327
00:17:09,101 -> 00:17:10,341
Just a pinch.

328
00:17:13,421 -> 00:17:15,941
I did not put much salt in it.

329
00:17:16,801 -> 00:17:18,591
Where do you keep the first aid kit?

330
00:17:18,691 -> 00:17:20,931
The language of my husband
is swelling like a melon.

331
00:17:21,141 -> 00:17:22,491
I need to go to the bathroom.

332
00:17:35,851 -> 00:17:37,081
I think Cindy was right.

333
00:17:37,360 -> 00:17:39,361
If you invite people to your party, they will come.

334
00:17:43,571 -> 00:17:49,730
Well, it looks fun, but
prefer not to have piercings, for a while

335
00:17:50,951 -> 00:17:56,130
Girls should get the planetary
have a great laser show.

336
00:17:56,250 -> 00:18:00,310
I have a card that allows
go to four for the price of three.

337
00:18:01,580 -> 00:18:02,910
Notify me go.

338
00:18:03,190 -> 00:18:07,000
As my grandmother to sleep,
I can get away and sit with you.

339
00:18:09,840 -> 00:18:11,220
Are you wearing cologne?

340
00:18:11,840 -> 00:18:15,100
Just me ... aftershave.

341
00:18:16,460 -> 00:18:17,410
Hi, Steve.

342
00:18:17,610 -> 00:18:19,860
I'm working ... here.

343
00:18:26,190 -> 00:18:27,839
Can we go please?

344
00:18:27,939 -> 00:18:29,810
Two hours and
then we go home.

345
00:18:29,910 -> 00:18:32,110
Francis, the project is due tomorrow.

346
00:18:32,510 -> 00:18:36,050
Do not worry.
It will take eight hours to arrive, we will then

347
00:18:36,570 -> 00:18:38,929
Indeed, it is Terri and her sister.

348
00:18:41,280 -> 00:18:43,969
Hello.
I'm Eric.

349
00:18:46,299 -> 00:18:48,279
Go to summer school.

350
00:18:52,389 -> 00:18:53,490
Dewie, go to your room.

351
00:18:53,490 -> 00:18:55,269
But Reese poisoned all these people.

352
00:18:55,269 -> 00:18:56,689
Now!

353
00:18:57,029 -> 00:18:58,480
What happens to you?

354
00:18:58,480 -> 00:19:00,229
I was not allowed to accept my trophy.

355
00:19:00,229 -> 00:19:02,129
I will give him a trophy, sir.

356
00:19:02,129 -> 00:19:04,129
Honey, what the kitchen was my idea.

357
00:19:04,129 -> 00:19:05,299
I'll handle this.

358
00:19:05,299 -> 00:19:08,169
Reese,'ll get you out of class
because we know that you cheated.

359
00:19:08,169 -> 00:19:10,679
Would have won easily.
Why did you?

360
00:19:10,679 -> 00:19:13,069
I do not know.
It was fun.

361
00:19:13,069 -> 00:19:16,159
These people worked very hard and you
destroyed them.

362
00:19:16,159 -> 00:19:19,419
How would you feel if you were the poor woman
Tissue with salt?

363
00:19:21,199 -> 00:19:22,939
Fat?.

364
00:19:25,078 -> 00:19:27,338
Reese, you know what is empathy?

365
00:19:28,138 -> 00:19:29,639
No.

366
00:19:28,839 -> 00:19:33,239
Empathy is putting yourself in the other
to make you feel how they feel.

367
00:19:33,628 -> 00:19:37,118
If you hurt someone,
Empathy makes you hurt as well.

368
00:19:38,218 -> 00:19:41,139
So, why would you want empathy?

369
00:19:44,228 -> 00:19:47,248
Has no sense of
good and bad that a frog.

370
00:19:47,248 -> 00:19:48,975
What shall we do?

371
00:19:48,975 -> 00:19:51,638
Back to punishment.

372
00:19:51,638 -> 00:19:53,628
How can we punish him if
do not mind ...?

373
00:19:57,248 -> 00:19:58,619
Son, this is what will happen.

374
00:19:58,619 -> 00:20:01,908
For the next month you do not have
to cook meals.

375
00:20:01,908 -> 00:20:03,665
Is that all?

376
00:20:05,538 -> 00:20:07,668
So do not cook.
Big deal.

377
00:20:08,147 -> 00:20:11,458
None of breast Cordon Blue
and no cake.

378
00:20:11,458 -> 00:20:12,577
Wait a second.

379
00:20:12,577 -> 00:20:14,797
You said nothing about cooking.
But the cakes are baked.

380
00:20:15,098 -> 00:20:17,738
Without baking, not fried, unsalted.

381
00:20:17,738 -> 00:20:19,177
We can not do that.

382
00:20:19,177 -> 00:20:20,397
Listen to your father.

383
00:20:20,397 -> 00:20:23,077
The stove and accessories are
banned for a month.

384
00:20:23,077 -> 00:20:25,777
Please, I'll be good, I promise.
I will do what they say.

385
00:20:25,777 -> 00:20:27,617
Sorry, son.

386
00:20:27,617 -> 00:20:30,109
So it should be.

387
00:20:35,422 -> 00:20:38,528
It worked.
We can control it.

388
00:20:38,528 -> 00:20:41,626
We have a weapon.
Your actions have consequences.

389
00:20:41,626 -> 00:20:44,179
I know.
We hurt.

390
00:20:44,179 -> 00:20:46,737
We can be parents again.

391
00:20:46,737 -> 00:20:49,737
While your steaks have to suffer
of pudding a month.

392
00:20:49,737 -> 00:20:51,347
Amen to that.

393
00:20:56,777 -> 00:20:58,786
You know what?
I realized something.

394
00:20:58,786 -> 00:21:00,097
The holidays suck.

395
00:21:00,097 -> 00:21:02,237
The music always sucks
the food is bad,

396
00:21:02,237 -> 00:21:04,197
And who cares if nobody speaks to you?

397
00:21:04,397 -> 00:21:06,516
People are fake anyway.

398
00:21:06,616 -> 00:21:07,946
- Hello, Malcolm.
- Hi, Cynthia.

399
00:21:08,336 -> 00:21:10,456
Great party.
I love music and dressing.

400
00:21:10,856 -> 00:21:13,037
You know what?
I need that chair.
