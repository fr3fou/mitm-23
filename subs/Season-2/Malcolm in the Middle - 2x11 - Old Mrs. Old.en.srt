1
00:00:29,726 -> 00:00:31,449
- J..
- J?

2
00:00:32,213 -> 00:00:33,322
Jaa ...

3
00:00:33,389 -> 00:00:34,323
Checkmate?

4
00:00:34,842 -> 00:00:35,859
Checkmate!

5
00:00:37,204 -> 00:00:38,227
Mmm ...

6
00:00:38,228 -> 00:00:40,463
MMMA ... mate?

7
00:00:41,468 -> 00:00:42,524
"Checkmate?

8
00:00:42,858 -> 00:00:45,249
Checkmate!
That's right!

9
00:00:45,250 -> 00:00:47,257
See? I told you!

10
00:00:49,293 -> 00:00:51,185
Excuse me, son

11
00:00:52,268 -> 00:00:53,668
Lois!

12
00:00:54,145 -> 00:00:56,416
The win leaves me
the Basket ball

13
00:01:29,990 -> 00:01:32,566
Well, give two turns,
hit the ball in the second

14
00:01:32,567 -> 00:01:35,724
cars are 2 points
and hydrates 3

15
00:01:35,787 -> 00:01:38,728
if you lose trap
and 2 if you get hit with ball

16
00:01:38,729 -> 00:01:41,828
But if they fail is a "google"
I'll explain when it happens

17
00:01:41,829 -> 00:01:42,829
it's your turn

18
00:01:43,211 -> 00:01:44,277
It's amazing!

19
00:01:44,278 -> 00:01:47,681
Reese can not pass math
but ah invented more than 50 games

20
00:01:47,682 -> 00:01:48,958
Fun Games

21
00:01:49,162 -> 00:01:50,268
Very good tour!

22
00:01:53,146 -> 00:01:54,612
I have it, I have!

23
00:01:58,778 -> 00:02:00,767
Not in the garden
Ms. Griffin

24
00:02:03,153 -> 00:02:06,112
- There is
- Does not want anybody in his yard

25
00:02:06,113 -> 00:02:08,657
Habre out
before noticing it, okay?

26
00:02:08,658 -> 00:02:12,163
that is old and poor does not give
right to keep our balls

27
00:02:12,164 -> 00:02:14,427
I agree
go for it

28
00:02:14,428 -> 00:02:15,742
Well, I will

29
00:02:16,294 -> 00:02:17,875
no big deal

30
00:02:18,254 -> 00:02:20,300
I see you move

31
00:02:33,400 -> 00:02:36,079
- What are you doing in my garden?
- Let go, it's my ball

32
00:02:36,080 -> 00:02:38,133
My house, my ball

33
00:02:38,134 -> 00:02:40,609
Who said
could come to my garden?

34
00:02:40,610 -> 00:02:41,970
What are you doing?

35
00:02:41,971 -> 00:02:44,938
Child chooses
your hair or the ball

36
00:02:46,923 -> 00:02:49,508
- Would you broke your arm?
- Looking for a ball

37
00:02:49,709 -> 00:02:52,208
Would you broke your arm
by a ball?

38
00:02:52,209 -> 00:02:54,647
No, already had the ball
and then push

39
00:02:54,648 -> 00:02:57,778
The push, and you
broke the arm by a ball!

40
00:02:58,057 -> 00:02:59,907
Was it a special ball?

41
00:02:59,908 -> 00:03:01,714
It was an old tennis ball

42
00:03:01,715 -> 00:03:04,289
Sometimes I do not understand why
does this kind of thing

43
00:03:04,290 -> 00:03:05,919
Luckily we do not demand!

44
00:03:05,920 -> 00:03:09,013
Grateful that we have nothing
value in this house

45
00:03:09,014 -> 00:03:11,319
- Say thanks son
- Talk to Mrs. Griffin

46
00:03:11,320 -> 00:03:12,666
This is what happened

47
00:03:12,667 -> 00:03:16,719
You will go home after school
and supports up to recover

48
00:03:16,720 -> 00:03:19,142
- "Every day?
- Not a word!

49
00:03:19,143 -> 00:03:20,647
Everyday!

50
00:03:20,648 -> 00:03:21,887
End of story!

51
00:03:22,718 -> 00:03:24,563
- Hello
- Hi Mom, listen

52
00:03:24,564 -> 00:03:26,537
Chance did you talk
Richie's mother?

53
00:03:26,538 -> 00:03:27,538
Yes, I did

54
00:03:27,539 -> 00:03:29,544
I found the
work the other day

55
00:03:29,545 -> 00:03:31,577
Did you talk something about Richie?

56
00:03:31,578 -> 00:03:33,030
Oh, that poor woman!

57
00:03:33,031 -> 00:03:35,344
Do you know what ah
fact that boy go?

58
00:03:35,345 -> 00:03:38,620
I told him to pack his things
and send him to military school

59
00:03:38,621 -> 00:03:41,005
before
were a major problem

60
00:03:41,006 -> 00:03:43,443
Very well, thank you
I have to go

61
00:03:44,565 -> 00:03:46,311
Well, it was not her

62
00:03:55,769 -> 00:03:57,360
I need another bag

63
00:03:57,361 -> 00:03:59,895
Again?
How the fuck up so much?

64
00:03:59,896 -> 00:04:00,896
Do not know

65
00:04:00,897 -> 00:04:03,149
Never buy another bag

66
00:04:03,150 -> 00:04:04,679
Looking for something in the closet

67
00:04:04,680 -> 00:04:05,825
Well

68
00:04:17,597 -> 00:04:19,585
Okay, maybe it
good to do this

69
00:04:19,586 -> 00:04:21,457
I'm not saying he is guilty

70
00:04:21,458 -> 00:04:23,332
But somehow
I am responsible

71
00:04:23,785 -> 00:04:26,786
I guess it was wrong
trespassing and if push

72
00:04:29,629 -> 00:04:32,056
and who knows, maybe
not so bad

73
00:04:32,057 -> 00:04:33,627
perhaps a grandmother

74
00:04:33,628 -> 00:04:36,211
Well, not like my grandmother,
like a nice grandmother

75
00:04:37,177 -> 00:04:39,865
Hi, Malcolm
the boy who broke her arm

76
00:04:39,866 -> 00:04:40,866
I'm so sorry

77
00:04:40,867 -> 00:04:44,768
Toma, fills this
I will not have drug addicts in my house

78
00:04:55,233 -> 00:04:59,267
God is like a pauper
and the house is your shopping cart

79
00:05:00,221 -> 00:05:03,607
Out of the way,
horrible beast from hell!

80
00:05:04,913 -> 00:05:06,994
- What do you do fool?
- What?

81
00:05:06,995 -> 00:05:08,990
Is this a bottle
gumdrops for you?

82
00:05:08,991 -> 00:05:11,043
This is a jar of candy!

83
00:05:11,044 -> 00:05:12,660
You are ignorant
or just stupid

84
00:05:12,661 -> 00:05:14,340
No, there is no such thing ...

85
00:05:14,341 -> 00:05:16,068
Did you finish moving
newspapers?

86
00:05:16,069 -> 00:05:17,069
almost

87
00:05:17,070 -> 00:05:18,402
Do you read all this?

88
00:05:18,403 -> 00:05:21,087
What do you do, write a book?
Just move them!

89
00:05:23,286 -> 00:05:24,663
What are you?

90
00:05:24,664 -> 00:05:27,258
- How old do I have?
- No

91
00:05:27,259 -> 00:05:30,969
What are you?.
Polish, Swedish, Apache

92
00:05:30,970 -> 00:05:32,650
I really do not know

93
00:05:33,652 -> 00:05:35,492
aha, a Mestizo

94
00:05:35,493 -> 00:05:37,425
Well, whatever you are

95
00:05:37,426 -> 00:05:39,248
Stay away from my liquor

96
00:05:39,249 -> 00:05:41,449
Look, it's almost 5
I will soon go

97
00:05:41,450 -> 00:05:42,450
Really?

98
00:05:42,451 -> 00:05:46,772
I did not know my arm
be cured at 5

99
00:05:46,773 -> 00:05:48,468
What shall I make for dinner?

100
00:05:48,500 -> 00:05:50,025
Can not you order food?

101
00:05:50,026 -> 00:05:52,258
I will not give my money
those Mexicans!

102
00:05:52,259 -> 00:05:56,158
They are as bad as the Lithuanian
under the blinds me

103
00:05:56,159 -> 00:05:58,128
loved ice cubes

104
00:05:58,129 -> 00:06:00,576
these Lithuanians and ice cubes

105
00:06:00,935 -> 00:06:03,150
I can not believe
it's horrible

106
00:06:03,562 -> 00:06:05,008
know not only

107
00:06:19,322 -> 00:06:21,395
- What is that?
- My new backpack

108
00:06:21,396 -> 00:06:23,901
Dewey, that's not a backpack
Mom's wallet

109
00:06:23,902 -> 00:06:26,049
- Go back and find something else
- No

110
00:06:26,050 -> 00:06:28,424
Use an invitation Dewey
to be hit

111
00:06:28,425 -> 00:06:29,429
Like

112
00:06:29,430 -> 00:06:32,205
Look, I do not think you understand

113
00:06:32,206 -> 00:06:34,254
Guys like myself
dream of something

114
00:06:34,255 -> 00:06:36,095
We look to the patio and see:

115
00:06:36,096 -> 00:06:38,680
normal children, normal Nuno
and the child with the portfolio

116
00:06:39,302 -> 00:06:40,758
Who do you think we hit?

117
00:06:40,759 -> 00:06:42,345
One of the normal "is fat?

118
00:06:42,346 -> 00:06:45,193
It does not matter!
Be fat every day!

119
00:06:45,483 -> 00:06:48,149
But the boy's bag
could not reuse

120
00:06:48,150 -> 00:06:49,541
I do not care, I like

121
00:06:49,542 -> 00:06:50,542
- Give me that!
- No

122
00:06:50,543 -> 00:06:52,666
You do not know what they are
these animals can

123
00:06:52,667 -> 00:06:53,667
Let me go!

124
00:06:55,400 -> 00:06:57,713
I try to protect yourself!

125
00:07:00,895 -> 00:07:02,827
Richie "what are you doing?

126
00:07:02,828 -> 00:07:05,329
There are inspection
can not sleep all morning

127
00:07:06,362 -> 00:07:07,415
Amigo!

128
00:07:07,415 -> 00:07:08,136
That was wrong!

129
00:07:08,137 -> 00:07:10,262
Richie does not
is at home

130
00:07:10,263 -> 00:07:13,062
You can not do what you want
These are tough guys

131
00:07:13,063 -> 00:07:16,115
and furthermore,
pillows are horrible

132
00:07:16,116 -> 00:07:17,501
Who do
to discuss that?

133
00:07:17,502 -> 00:07:18,502
Attention!

134
00:07:19,692 -> 00:07:20,995
Stand up!

135
00:07:25,480 -> 00:07:27,396
"Pajamas, Cadet?

136
00:07:27,397 -> 00:07:29,456
Lord, I regret
appearance of my partner

137
00:07:29,457 -> 00:07:32,615
New to the Academy
you take a set time

138
00:07:32,616 -> 00:07:35,088
ooh, you're the one
give us weapons?

139
00:07:36,230 -> 00:07:40,319
can see that is eager to assimilate
our military lifestyle

140
00:07:40,320 -> 00:07:43,462
- What is your name cadet?
- Richie, a pleasure

141
00:07:43,463 -> 00:07:45,338
Listen, cadet

142
00:07:46,144 -> 00:07:49,174
This will not be easy for you

143
00:07:49,175 -> 00:07:53,006
his family sent him here
because they could not control it

144
00:07:53,007 -> 00:07:54,457
Perhaps it was a darling

145
00:07:54,458 -> 00:07:56,809
Well, no pampering here

146
00:07:56,810 -> 00:07:59,413
Make a mistake
and you will be punished

147
00:07:59,414 -> 00:08:02,906
Beware cadet
does not take away an eye on

148
00:08:05,886 -> 00:08:07,188
Is good!

149
00:08:07,189 -> 00:08:08,189
Excuse me?

150
00:08:08,190 -> 00:08:10,310
"I did not remove his eyes off"

151
00:08:10,311 -> 00:08:12,441
and has only one eye

152
00:08:12,929 -> 00:08:14,249
As Popeye!

153
00:08:14,250 -> 00:08:16,865
I think it's great
that does not bother

154
00:08:20,691 -> 00:08:22,394
That's new!

155
00:08:22,395 -> 00:08:24,946
I never had that

156
00:08:25,326 -> 00:08:26,529
Continue

157
00:08:28,474 -> 00:08:31,099
Popeye!, That's funny

158
00:08:34,061 -> 00:08:36,440
Is that the butler or something?

159
00:08:39,686 -> 00:08:41,757
I can not close your eyes!
every time I do,

160
00:08:41,758 -> 00:08:44,334
I return to see what
beneath that robe

161
00:08:44,611 -> 00:08:45,997
I can not go back!

162
00:08:46,213 -> 00:08:48,289
Malcolm, because you are not
home of Mrs. Griffin

163
00:08:48,290 -> 00:08:50,077
He says he does not need me

164
00:08:50,078 -> 00:08:52,276
Has new medicine, is good
for the bones of the elderly

165
00:08:52,277 -> 00:08:55,317
Is very proud
I think that bothers you go

166
00:08:56,499 -> 00:08:58,504
I'm so sorry!

167
00:08:58,505 -> 00:08:59,505
Okay

168
00:09:00,291 -> 00:09:04,588
Your age I would not want
spending time with an elderly

169
00:09:04,589 -> 00:09:06,822
to which it has broken arm

170
00:09:12,341 -> 00:09:15,319
You are a rude little boy!

171
00:09:15,320 -> 00:09:18,643
Trying to hurt a
aged more than it already has undergone

172
00:09:18,644 -> 00:09:19,644
Yes, ma'am

173
00:09:19,645 -> 00:09:22,206
You are a disgusting liar right?

174
00:09:22,207 -> 00:09:24,979
Well liar
you're the one who will suffer

175
00:09:24,980 -> 00:09:27,972
as soon as look
my medicine and get home

176
00:09:29,008 -> 00:09:32,075
damn plaster
sting like Greek sailor

177
00:09:32,862 -> 00:09:34,715
Release the wheel!

178
00:09:35,575 -> 00:09:36,717
Hi Dewey

179
00:09:37,981 -> 00:09:40,021
You know, I've been thinking

180
00:09:40,117 -> 00:09:42,152
Remember that I gave you
anything for your birthday?

181
00:09:42,153 -> 00:09:43,153
if

182
00:09:43,154 -> 00:09:44,746
Well, here you go!

183
00:09:45,055 -> 00:09:46,207
Happy Birthday!

184
00:09:46,208 -> 00:09:48,721
- Since I have a backpack
- Not like this

185
00:09:48,722 -> 00:09:50,840
Look, this is a whistle

186
00:09:51,665 -> 00:09:52,991
Why you scared?

187
00:09:52,992 -> 00:09:54,446
I'm giving you something nice

188
00:09:54,447 -> 00:09:55,551
- But it accepts

189
00:09:55,552 -> 00:09:57,344
- Here, it's yours
- No

190
00:09:57,379 -> 00:09:59,603
Why not let me
do something nice?

191
00:09:59,604 -> 00:10:00,604
Not!

192
00:10:00,605 -> 00:10:03,142
Will use it and no
nothing you can do!

193
00:10:03,857 -> 00:10:05,533
Dad got to do something

194
00:10:05,534 -> 00:10:07,264
Dewey carry bag
school breast

195
00:10:07,265 -> 00:10:09,023
Do not worry son
is a stage

196
00:10:09,024 -> 00:10:11,558
Do not you worry about what
think of you as a parent?

197
00:10:11,559 -> 00:10:14,613
Reese, bag boy
is the backpack of another

198
00:10:14,614 -> 00:10:15,801
If European

199
00:10:16,151 -> 00:10:19,533
You can not imagine the times and
been jealous of your mother and her bag

200
00:10:19,834 -> 00:10:21,788
The man we need to
manage our lives

201
00:10:21,789 -> 00:10:24,077
in small squares of leather
And sit on it!

202
00:10:24,078 -> 00:10:26,326
Do not tell me not to worry

203
00:10:26,327 -> 00:10:29,283
But let
Dewey have your bag

204
00:10:29,284 -> 00:10:32,144
We may open the
way to others

205
00:10:33,341 -> 00:10:36,528
I do not think these pills
are working

206
00:10:36,822 -> 00:10:40,817
I keep taking them
and I feel nothing

207
00:10:41,400 -> 00:10:43,874
Do not be stingy with the cream

208
00:10:45,896 -> 00:10:48,708
You'll need a knife
when you get calluses

209
00:10:49,426 -> 00:10:54,692
If you did not know him well say that
that new doctor was Hungarian

210
00:10:54,915 -> 00:10:57,351
Dr. Freeman

211
00:10:57,732 -> 00:10:58,352
Freeman!

212
00:11:00,011 -> 00:11:03,487
If this is not the
name of an immigrant

213
00:11:03,488 -> 00:11:05,839
I'll eat my
Sunday hat

214
00:11:06,964 -> 00:11:10,236
I believe I can
take those pills with alcohol

215
00:11:10,237 -> 00:11:13,897
Oh, now you
care about me

216
00:11:14,764 -> 00:11:17,419
Where was that when
broke my arm?

217
00:11:17,620 -> 00:11:22,284
If you like this scandalous
I have used that

218
00:11:22,285 -> 00:11:24,378
Your hands also
are similar

219
00:11:24,386 -> 00:11:26,075
Small

220
00:11:27,116 -> 00:11:29,352
As a girl

221
00:11:30,531 -> 00:11:32,625
Okay, enough!

222
00:11:32,625 -> 00:11:34,785
You are a person
horrible and I hate you!

223
00:11:34,786 -> 00:11:37,624
Are not supposed to hate anyone
but if anyone deserves it

224
00:11:37,625 -> 00:11:38,625
You

225
00:11:45,403 -> 00:11:47,546
You did well to call

226
00:11:47,547 -> 00:11:50,033
How long ... leads .. well?

227
00:11:50,034 -> 00:11:51,907
Hours.
Faint for a while

228
00:11:51,908 -> 00:11:54,060
Wake up, take more pills
and becomes faint

229
00:11:54,061 -> 00:11:55,061
"Pernabuthon"

230
00:11:55,062 -> 00:11:56,062
What is the dosage?

231
00:11:56,063 -> 00:11:57,752
hundred milligrams, two a day

232
00:11:57,753 -> 00:12:00,323
Do you take .. drugs .. with this?

233
00:12:00,324 -> 00:12:01,324
I doubt it!

234
00:12:01,325 -> 00:12:03,592
Is contraindicated
from 87

235
00:12:03,593 -> 00:12:07,344
This seems to be a reaction
to mix with alcohol

236
00:12:07,345 -> 00:12:08,498
Absolutely

237
00:12:08,499 -> 00:12:10,256
If you're like my mother

238
00:12:10,257 -> 00:12:14,259
Mrs. Griffin will
unconscious about 3 hours

239
00:12:14,260 -> 00:12:16,633
We ... unsupervised

240
00:12:16,634 -> 00:12:19,701
Are you thinking
like me?

241
00:12:30,177 -> 00:12:31,962
Is this what you thought?

242
00:12:31,963 -> 00:12:33,718
At the very least

243
00:12:33,719 -> 00:12:35,758
I was thinking something more like ..

244
00:12:41,625 -> 00:12:43,826
Why do
you cut your hair?

245
00:12:43,827 -> 00:12:44,827
Do not know

246
00:12:44,828 -> 00:12:47,266
Why Spangler
let him beat use in class?

247
00:12:47,267 -> 00:12:48,267
Do not know

248
00:12:48,268 -> 00:12:51,740
- Maybe he saved the life Spangler
- It saved his life Spangler

249
00:12:51,741 -> 00:12:54,752
Well, there must be something
because this is not no good

250
00:12:55,243 -> 00:12:56,606
Richie

251
00:12:57,812 -> 00:12:59,167
Take a coin

252
00:12:59,486 -> 00:13:01,912
- Thanks boss
- No problem, Richie

253
00:13:01,913 -> 00:13:05,360
- Is that Spangler's son?
- It is not the son of Spangler

254
00:13:05,689 -> 00:13:10,079
I grew up with is a waste.
a bum who lives in the basement of his mother

255
00:13:10,080 -> 00:13:12,423
It must be that Spangler
is softening!

256
00:13:13,282 -> 00:13:14,429
Lord!

257
00:13:14,872 -> 00:13:15,906
Cadets

258
00:13:17,389 -> 00:13:18,784
What about boss?

259
00:13:30,727 -> 00:13:33,094
<i> you and secure from the start </ i>

260
00:13:33,095 -> 00:13:36,937
<i> and you could not fool my eyes </ i>

261
00:13:36,938 -> 00:13:42,157
<i> come here, you place a role in the bulb
and you think the Queen of the Nile </ i>

262
00:13:42,158 -> 00:13:44,320
<i> I say HA! </ i>

263
00:13:44,321 -> 00:13:48,948
<i> Always and depended on
Kindness of Strangers </ i>

264
00:13:48,949 -> 00:13:54,683
<i> Stella, Stella! </ i>

265
00:13:57,487 -> 00:14:00,357
That was great!
What next?

266
00:14:00,358 -> 00:14:01,358
I have no idea

267
00:14:01,359 -> 00:14:03,660
Not much to do
in this house

268
00:14:03,661 -> 00:14:05,996
There must be something
Come on, think!

269
00:14:05,997 -> 00:14:06,997
With our brains

270
00:14:06,998 -> 00:14:09,504
and your gift for
inappropriate behavior

271
00:14:09,505 -> 00:14:12,049
There must be something
more we can do!

272
00:14:14,292 -> 00:14:18,493
- I never felt so alive!
- We are outlaws!

273
00:14:18,494 -> 00:14:20,916
This .. is great!

274
00:14:20,917 -> 00:14:23,651
I think that 45 minutes
removing calluses

275
00:14:23,652 -> 00:14:25,912
worth at least
an hour in the car

276
00:14:26,526 -> 00:14:30,919
<i> In good times, we ignore
in bad torment us </ i>

277
00:14:30,920 -> 00:14:33,481
<i> now changed roles </ i>

278
00:14:33,482 -> 00:14:38,726
The brains loose
beware!

279
00:14:41,101 -> 00:14:41,884
"What!?

280
00:14:41,885 -> 00:14:43,325
What is happening?

281
00:14:58,273 -> 00:15:01,645
He saw me, saw me!
I'm dead!

282
00:15:01,646 -> 00:15:05,804
We're all dead!
Does not enter into a good college!

283
00:15:05,805 -> 00:15:07,531
My mom would kill me!

284
00:15:07,532 -> 00:15:11,803
drive to a
cliff like Thelma and Louise

285
00:15:11,804 -> 00:15:14,732
That everything must
end in suicide for you

286
00:15:15,012 -> 00:15:16,873
Well, do not panic!

287
00:15:16,874 -> 00:15:19,735
Everyone calm
and think right?

288
00:15:20,208 -> 00:15:22,221
First, I think
you did not see

289
00:15:22,222 -> 00:15:24,614
so no
to worry ...

290
00:15:25,287 -> 00:15:26,338
"Boys?

291
00:15:31,801 -> 00:15:34,027
Stevie "need help?

292
00:15:34,028 -> 00:15:36,830
Open ... trunk

293
00:15:38,657 -> 00:15:40,158
Forward

294
00:15:40,623 -> 00:15:43,047
- Lord, is about Richie
- You okay?

295
00:15:43,048 -> 00:15:44,875
Is more than good
in paradise

296
00:15:44,876 -> 00:15:46,662
Do not you think it is a
bit soft with him?

297
00:15:46,663 -> 00:15:47,663
If

298
00:15:47,664 -> 00:15:48,664
The leaves get away with it

299
00:15:48,665 -> 00:15:50,201
Of course, if

300
00:15:50,202 -> 00:15:52,892
Do you know what he thinks is
immune to any punishment?

301
00:15:52,893 -> 00:15:54,821
What you can do what you want?

302
00:15:54,822 -> 00:15:57,023
I am and if you can

303
00:15:57,321 -> 00:16:00,422
Lord ..
Are you playing me?

304
00:16:00,423 -> 00:16:03,329
It is not
You always, cadet

305
00:16:03,130 -> 00:16:04,777
So what is it?

306
00:16:06,705 -> 00:16:09,805
Francis, I'm not an idiot

307
00:16:10,491 -> 00:16:15,693
Think not that Richie is a
immoral? , By god, is a cancer!

308
00:16:15,694 -> 00:16:18,790
A cancer that must be eliminated

309
00:16:18,791 -> 00:16:21,687
If the attitude of Richie
extends to other cadets

310
00:16:21,688 -> 00:16:23,692
I do not imagine what would happen

311
00:16:23,693 -> 00:16:26,041
What does it mean?
Are you treated like a god?

312
00:16:26,042 -> 00:16:29,638
and that puts
other angry right?

313
00:16:29,639 -> 00:16:33,958
makes all
want to beat his friend

314
00:16:34,159 -> 00:16:37,240
a moment that we
making against

315
00:16:37,241 -> 00:16:39,259
wants us
get rid of Richie

316
00:16:39,260 -> 00:16:41,704
Okay, cadet

317
00:16:42,308 -> 00:16:45,757
Vera, every threat to
academy should be treated differently

318
00:16:45,758 -> 00:16:48,583
Your Francis, should be
punished like a dog

319
00:16:49,082 -> 00:16:52,059
Richie was ah
"Killed with kindness"

320
00:16:52,060 -> 00:16:56,769
or at least
treated with kindness

321
00:16:57,156 -> 00:16:59,872
Very clever sir!

322
00:16:59,873 -> 00:17:02,998
But what makes him believe that
Richie will not tell about your plan?

323
00:17:03,299 -> 00:17:05,853
Forward, but not
I think I do

324
00:17:06,104 -> 00:17:07,828
It's my best friend
Why do not you say?

325
00:17:07,829 -> 00:17:09,916
Because it hates you too

326
00:17:09,917 -> 00:17:13,432
Jealous of the attentions
he gets

327
00:17:13,433 -> 00:17:16,729
Expensive dinners

The massage sessions having
while you are training

329
00:17:21,313 -> 00:17:22,876

I have no time to talk

334
00:17:34,473 -> 00:17:35,951
Wait, it is important

335
00:17:35,952 -> 00:17:39,575
Be careful, this shirt was a gift
Edwin, will cost $ 200

336

Well, fast-talking

338
00:17:43,339 -> 00:17:45,590
Edwin would be angry if
I'm late to the party

These jealous that
Edwin and I are friends

00:18:11,023 -> 00:18:13,712
and want to generate
discord between us

348
00:18:13,713 -> 00:18:15,230
That is sad friend

349
00:18:16,297 -> 00:18:18,014
Just remember that I told you

350
00:18:18,015 -> 00:18:20,907
As friend
I'll be fine

351
00:18:21,724 -> 00:18:22,886
But I told you!

352

Sorry

359
00:18:50,056 -> 00:18:52,609

so stupid but I did

360
00:18:52,610 -> 00:18:53,610
and sorry

361

You're a good woman

363
00:19:03,556 -> 00:19:05,941
If you have a modicum of decency

364
00:19:05,942 -> 00:19:08,340
Give me 5 seconds
to escape to Mexico

Malcolm looks cough things, we leave.

00:19:22,117 -> 00:19:23,228
Why he's sorry?

368
00:19:23,229 -> 00:19:25,964
My son stole the car
and left to spin

369
00:19:25,965 -> 00:19:26,965
"To spin?

370
00:19:26,966 -> 00:19:30,839

fainted in the back seat

00:19:30,840 -> 00:19:31,840
What?

372
00:19:31,841 -> 00:19:35,219
Drug confused me
and took me to hospital

373
00:19:37,910 -> 00:19:39,732
"I took her to hospital?

374
00:19:39,733 -> 00:19:41,465
Who else would I?

375
00:19:41,466 -> 00:19:43,665
I am an old woman
living alone

376
00:19:44,841 -> 00:19:48,083
Malcolm, when a
emergency must notify us

377
00:19:48,084 -> 00:19:51,276
If you're right, not
I was thinking

378
00:19:51,863 -> 00:19:54,600
I was not thinking,
just did

379
00:19:54,601 -> 00:19:55,601
Sorry

380
00:19:59,777 -> 00:20:01,973
Well, think fast

381
00:20:02,357 -> 00:20:03,938
It's a good boy

382
00:20:03,939 -> 00:20:06,277

Thanks

384
00:20:07,279 -> 00:20:09,696
In fact it is so nice

385
00:20:09,697 -> 00:20:13,822
who offered to help
before school

386
00:20:13,823 -> 00:20:16,634
Before school
Really?

387
00:20:16,635 -> 00:20:19,294
I also thought
it was too

388
00:20:19,295 -> 00:20:25,383
And these old bones
heal so slow, it will take months

389
00:20:25,384 -> 00:20:27,190
But he insisted

390
00:20:28,069 -> 00:20:29,199
