1
00:00:02,085 --> 00:00:03,462
Bottom of the ninth.

2
00:00:03,504 --> 00:00:05,840
Two outs, man on first.

3
00:00:05,881 --> 00:00:07,007
The windup...

4
00:00:07,883 --> 00:00:09,009
The pitch...

5
00:00:12,471 --> 00:00:13,931
Uh-oh.

6
00:00:13,973 --> 00:00:15,432
Oh, man, we're so dead.

7
00:00:15,474 --> 00:00:16,851
That's it. Game over.

8
00:00:16,892 --> 00:00:17,977
Yeah.

9
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:19,854
So I win.
What?!

10
00:00:19,895 --> 00:00:21,897
Past the lamp is a home run.

11
00:00:21,939 --> 00:00:23,064
Two men scored.

12
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:23,983
That was a foul ball.

13
00:00:24,023 --> 00:00:24,984
Are you crazy?

14
00:00:25,024 --> 00:00:26,067
It went right down the line.

15
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:27,736
It was foul.
Shut up.

16
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:29,070
You're home plate.
You don't get a vote.

17
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:31,072
And it was fair.
Do over.

18
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:32,533
Fine by me.

19
00:00:36,954 --> 00:00:39,080
Oh, crap!

20
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:40,081
Now we really have to quit.

21
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:42,083
Yeah, but that was a triple.

22
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:43,961
Get back up there.

The thing
about playing

36
00:01:26,837 --> 00:01:28,505
at Stevie
Kenarban's house is

37
00:01:28,547 --> 00:01:31,132
he has every one
of my favorite video games

38
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:32,760
from when I was four.

39
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:36,513
End of... the rainbow.

40
00:01:36,555 --> 00:01:38,139
I win...

41
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:40,141
the gold.

42
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:41,142
Don't you have something

43
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:43,020
with a little bit
more violence in it?

44
00:01:43,062 --> 00:01:45,856
Fishing... for Fishies.

45
00:01:45,898 --> 00:01:47,608
Sometimes...

46
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:49,150
he drowns.

47
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:50,402
Boys!

48
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:52,112
I've got snacks.

49
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:54,155
Hands.

50
00:01:57,284 --> 00:02:00,037
Now... who wants applesauce?

51
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,162
I do.

52
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:03,415
Stevie, there is no need
to use your outdoor voice.

53
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:04,583
And I've got
some cinnamon

54
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:07,168
if you guys are feeling
a little crazy.

55
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:09,880
Feeling... crazy?

56
00:02:09,922 --> 00:02:10,839
A little.

57
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:13,675
That's my mom.

58
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:15,218
Oh, well, she always honks.

59
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,763
Tell her she's welcome
to come in anytime.

60
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:19,180
We're not going to bite.

61
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:20,181
It's not personal.

62
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:21,558
I think she just
likes honking.

63
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,810
Malcolm!

64
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:24,185
Well, you'd
better get going.

65
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:25,353
I mean, you don't
want to make her mad.

66
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:26,271
She's always mad.

67
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:27,230
Malcolm, I mean it!

68
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:28,440
I have ice
cream melting!

69
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:30,191
Here's your...
Oh, no, no, no.

70
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:31,192
Eat it in the car.

71
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:32,486
Eat it in the car.

72
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:40,201
Oops.

73
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:41,161
Jerk.

74
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:43,246
You looked.

75
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:45,206
Ow!

76
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:46,625
We're doing
this new thing

77
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:47,876
called the circle game.

78
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:50,045
Basically, if you
can make the other guy

79
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:52,380
look at your hand
while you're doing this...

80
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:54,842
below your waist,
you get to hit them in the arm.

81
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:57,218
It's stupid, but, hey--
you get to hit people.

82
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,219
Barn door's open.

83
00:02:58,261 --> 00:02:59,178
Huh?

84
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:02,641
Aah!

85
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:03,892
Boys.

86
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:05,226
That was
Kitty Kenarban.

87
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:07,270
She wants to go
out for dinner.

88
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:09,230
That sounds like fun.
Good for you, dear.

89
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:10,607
She meant the whole family.

90
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:11,525
Oh.

91
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:12,526
Mom, I don't think

92
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:13,819
that's really
a good idea.

93
00:03:13,861 --> 00:03:15,070
I mean, the
Kenarbans

94
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:17,906
are kind of...
well, boring.

95
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:19,658
They're refined, Malcolm,

96
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,909
and it wouldn't be
the worst thing in the world

97
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:23,244
if some of their manners
rubbed off on you boys.

98
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:25,080
I just don't think you guys
would get along with them.

99
00:03:25,122 --> 00:03:26,247
Don't be silly.

100
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:28,959
I think it's nice
she's asking us out to dinner.

101
00:03:29,001 --> 00:03:31,920
It's been a long time since
anyone invited us anywhere.

102
00:03:31,962 --> 00:03:33,964
I wonder why that is.

103
00:03:34,006 --> 00:03:35,924
I think I see
some hungry seals.

104
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:51,565
Cadets...

105
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:56,195
as you know, I don't often
reveal my... personal side,

106
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:59,280
but after 20 years
of separation,

107
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:04,285
my mother has agreed
to visit with me this weekend.

108
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:06,287
She is a very demanding woman,

109
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:09,124
and I haven't seen her
for a long time.

110
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:14,088
I want things to go well.

111
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:18,592
That means I will have no time
for antics, shenanigans,

112
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:20,969
hooliganism
or tomfoolery.

113
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:23,180
There will be no problems

114
00:04:23,222 --> 00:04:27,308
which take me away
from time with Mother.

115
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:31,021
This is important to me,
which makes it...

116
00:04:31,063 --> 00:04:32,564
Important to us.

117
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:34,233
So it is crystal clear.

118
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,735
I will not
be disturbed this weekend.

119
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:39,320
Yes, sir!

120
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:40,530
As you were.

121
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:44,325
Whoa, he sounds
pretty serious.

122
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:46,954
Yeah. What time you want
to start the party?

123
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,371
Hmm?
What are you
talking about?

124
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:50,749
Didn't you hear
what Spangler just said?

125
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:53,334
All I heard was
he's going
to be too busy

126
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:55,336
with his mother
to pay us any attention.

127
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:57,798
What kind of party
did you have in mind?

128
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,049
Oh, I don't know.

129
00:04:59,091 --> 00:05:01,009
I'm sure I can come
up with something

130
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:02,469
that we'll all find amusing.

131
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:26,243
Well, howdy, girls.

132
00:05:26,285 --> 00:05:28,245
I couldn't help
but notice you all

133
00:05:28,287 --> 00:05:30,038
hanging out here
by the fence

134
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,372
for the last six months.

135
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:33,625
Would you like to come
to a party tomorrow night?

136
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:36,377
Wh... you're going
to let us come inside?

137
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:40,799
Oh, well, sure, that'd be
the neighborly thing to do.

138
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:45,386
I would kill or die
to go to your party.

139
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:48,056
Seriously-- kill or die.

140
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:49,683
Well, that's the spirit.

141
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:51,392
Okay, I'll take you

142
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:53,436
and you and you

143
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:54,437
and you.

144
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:55,605
Wait a minute.

145
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:57,316
Isn't this kind
of degrading?

146
00:05:57,356 --> 00:05:58,650
Okay, not you

147
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,694
and you and you...

148
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:05,406
I want to eat
that one and that one.

149
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:06,867
Oh, and those two.

150
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:08,327
Isn't this nice?

151
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:10,620
No pirate themes.

152
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:14,624
No ball pits filled
with screaming children.

153
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,668
Hal, look.

154
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,338
"Please wait to be seated."

155
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:20,297
Look, a dollar.

156
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:21,380
Oh, it's mine.

157
00:06:23,382 --> 00:06:27,428
Damn. I never fall
for that amateur stuff.

158
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:30,849
Now, I am going to say this
once and only once.

159
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:32,642
We are with
respectable
people tonight.

160
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:34,602
You are to be well mannered
and act civilized,

161
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:36,730
or so help me, I'll wring
your little necks, you hear me?

162
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:42,277
Okay, here's the plan if we want
to ditch out of this thing.

163
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,444
At the beginning,
I'll say that I think

164
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:44,696
I might be coming down
with something...

165
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:46,614
Hal, I don't want to
ditch out of this.

166
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:47,908
I'm looking
forward to it.

167
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:49,450
The Kenarbans
are nice people,

168
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:51,161
and they want to be
friends with us.

169
00:06:51,203 --> 00:06:52,913
So you're-you're saying
I'm on my own here.

170
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:53,914
Yoo-hoo, hi there.

171
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:55,540
Hello.

172
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:56,457
Abe.

173
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:57,709
Hal. I think I might

174
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:59,669
be coming down
with something.

175
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:01,462
Sorry we're late--
some jackass

176
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:03,882
parked in the
handicapped space.

177
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:07,719
Oh, huh, huh.

178
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:09,846
Why don't you guys
get seated and I-I...

179
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:11,890
I got to get something
out of the car.

180
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:13,850
I'll just be a...

181
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:24,111
Why didn't we think
of doing this sooner?

182
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:31,368
Don't you think they're
getting a little loud?

183
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:34,246
Spangler's only
two buildings over.

184
00:07:35,247 --> 00:07:36,497
Uh... ladies.

185
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,499
This is all great,
but if we could just

186
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,043
take it down a teensy bit.

187
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:42,545
Whoo! I marked him, girl!

188
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:43,797
He's mine!

189
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:50,511
Now, remember,

190
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,513
no throwing ice.

191
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:54,515
No flicking butter
at the ceiling.

192
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:56,184
No sticking gum
under the table

193
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:58,478
and no eating gum already
stuck under the table.

194
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:00,730
Keep your
voices down.

195
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:02,607
You are warned.

196
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:03,942
You look very
nice, Stevie.

197
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:07,528
Oh, great.

198
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:08,738
Who spilled?

199
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:11,532
Aw.

200
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:12,533
Ow.

201
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:14,535
Circle game?

202
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:17,331
I want to... play.

203
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:18,539
I don't know, Stevie.

204
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:20,000
It's... it's pretty rough.

205
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,542
Oh, come on, quit babying him.

206
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:23,462
If he wants to play,
let him play.

207
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,422
Now, remember, Stevie,
don't look at this...

208
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:27,966
...uh... or this.

209
00:08:32,304 --> 00:08:35,390
He's... good.

210
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,270
Well, this
is nice.

211
00:08:40,312 --> 00:08:42,605
I've been looking forward
to this for a long time.

212
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:44,565
I don't know why we
didn't do this sooner.

213
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:51,156
Do I feel flush?

214
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:52,573
No.

215
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:55,076
Would anyone like a
drink before you order?

216
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:56,077
Oh, yeah.

217
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:58,579
Uh, he'll have
a diet soda.

218
00:08:58,621 --> 00:08:59,580
And you, sir?

219
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:00,832
Uh...

220
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:02,583
what the heck--
lemonade.

221
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:03,835
I'll have an iced tea.

222
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:05,586
Sorry, we're out.

223
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:07,588
Oh, uh, well, then,
I'll have a...

224
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,424
Wait a minute-- what's
that guy having?

225
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,386
That's hot tea.

226
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:13,594
This is ridiculous.

227
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:15,389
You have tea, you have ice.

228
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:16,639
Make her some iced tea.

229
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:18,099
Oh, no, no, no,
that is fine.

230
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:19,309
I would love
a hot tea.

231
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:31,612
Wow.

232
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:34,449
This is really nice.

233
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:40,580
Well, I have to
use the restroom.

234
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:50,549
I think I also need
to use the restroom.

235
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:05,021
Girls! You've got
to be quiet! Please!

236
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:13,654
♪ You and me, baby,
ain't nothin' but mammals ♪

237
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:16,866
♪ So let's do it like they do
on the Discovery Channel! ♪

238
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:20,120
Way to go, Francis.

239
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:23,081
Hey, I promised
you girls-- not
quality girls.

240
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:24,124
Wow!

241
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:30,713
Well, gentlemen--

242
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:32,673
I've had enough experience
with debacles

243
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,175
to know when to cut your losses.

244
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:36,094
It's time to get Spangler.

245
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:38,305
No. Come on,
we're not wusses.

246
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:40,140
We can handle this ourselves.

247
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:42,350
I'm going to put a stop
to this right now.

248
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:44,352
All right, girls,
party's over.

249
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:47,855
Help! Mama!

250
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,690
They're seeing my underpants.

251
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:51,067
Help!

252
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:11,712
Nice... one.

253
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:12,713
Stevie, quit the game.

254
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:14,007
You're just getting punched.

255
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:15,425
You haven't gotten us once.

256
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:17,177
Oh, yeah?

257
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:18,595
Then how come...

258
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:21,722
you saw...

259
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:23,350
this?

260
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:27,728
Damn.

261
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:31,732
I swear, Hal, you said,
"I feel flushed"

262
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:33,985
five seconds
before I was about to.
Oh, yeah?

263
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:36,530
Salud.

264
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:40,325
Look at us now--
two grown men

265
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:42,910
having to sneak off from their
wives just to have a drink.

266
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:45,746
How sad.
Nah, no, no.

267
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:47,748
It's really not like that
with me and Kitty.

268
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,917
Sure, I might let her think
she's in charge,

269
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:52,170
but when it comes down
to the important stuff,

270
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:53,588
Daddy rules the roost.

271
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,965
Oh, hi, Kitty.

272
00:11:57,509 --> 00:11:59,760
I got you!

273
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:02,055
I did.

274
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:03,223
To being whipped.

275
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:04,391
Like butter, my friend.

276
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:09,312
Kitty.

277
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:16,486
Where are those guys?

278
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:19,573
Hal probably dragged
Abe over to the bar.

279
00:12:19,614 --> 00:12:20,948
You know, if he's drunk,
so help me...

280
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,200
Oh, no-no-no. It's okay.

281
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:25,744
Gives us a chance to talk.

282
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:30,417
Here we are--
diet soda...

283
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,419
lemonade...

284
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,712
and cranberry juice.

285
00:12:33,752 --> 00:12:36,797
Thank you.
Cranberry juice?

286
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,799
After all that static he
gave you about ordering tea,

287
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:40,093
he gives you cranberry juice?

288
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:41,802
Excuse me?
No-no-no,

289
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:42,596
it's fine.

290
00:12:42,637 --> 00:12:43,804
Something wrong?

291
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:45,265
Yes. My friend ordered tea

292
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:47,726
and you've brought her
cranberry juice.

293
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:49,436
I don't think so.

294
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:50,811
Instead of arguing with me,
why don't you

295
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:52,272
just march back
to the kitchen and make...

296
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:54,482
No-no-no.
I like cranberry juice.

297
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:56,943
Very healthy for you. Mmm...

298
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,823
Hey, Reese, that's enough!

299
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:04,409
This isn't funny anymore.

300
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:05,826
Okay, okay.

301
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:07,454
Man, look what
your shoulders did

302
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:08,663
to my knuckles.

303
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:15,836
I'll get you
when I come back.

304
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:18,839
I even knew...

305
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:20,841
he was going...

306
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,260
to do that.

307
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:24,429
She won't let me

308
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:27,474
have butter on my
bread--  butter.

309
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:30,685
I haven't eaten the
stuff in ten years.

310
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:33,854
How'd this happen?

311
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:35,774
We weren't always this way.

312
00:13:35,814 --> 00:13:36,857
Actually, I was.

313
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,025
Classic story--

314
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:41,738
raised by a grandmother
and four spinster aunts.

315
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:44,865
I used to wash their
hair on Saturday nights.

316
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:47,868
You poor bastard,
you never had a chance.

317
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:51,830
Damn it... enough is enough!

318
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:08,640
You go, Abe!

319
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:13,520
Go! Go! Go!

320
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:24,905
Sir?

321
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:26,324
Go away!

322
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:28,576
I told you I did not
want to be disturbed.

323
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:31,162
My aunt and I are...
catching up.

324
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:35,041
I... I thought you said
it was your mother, sir.

325
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,918
Go away!

326
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,212
I wish I could, sir,

327
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:41,088
but we have
a bit of a situation.

328
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,132
See, we decided
to have this party

329
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:44,634
and it kind of
got out of hand...

330
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:45,926
I don't care, cadet.

331
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:47,928
I will deal with
it in the morning.
Yeah, but...

332
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,222
In the morning!

333
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:51,932
It's just that we invited
some of the local girls...

334
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:53,059
Local girls?!

335
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:57,980
There are local girls
inside the perimeter?

336
00:14:58,022 --> 00:14:59,357
Have they killed anyone?

337
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:00,608
N-No, sir,

338
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:02,777
but I saw one of them
eat a raw chicken whole.

339
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:06,406
Spangy.
Uh... just a minute... Mother.

340
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:08,867
Do you have any idea
what you have done?

341
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,118
Marlin Academy
cannot exist

342
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,954
without the support, the
goodwill and cooperation

343
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:15,415
of the local community.

344
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:16,957
The police chief and the mayor

345
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:18,585
both sit
on our board of governors!

346
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:20,461
The fire chief
is a regent!

347
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:24,215
And right now their psychotic
offspring are in there

348
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:26,843
tearing up the floorboards!

349
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:29,970
It won't be long
before they're in the air ducts.

350
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:31,972
What are we going
to do, sir?

351
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:35,226
We are going to do
what any self-respecting
member of society does

352
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:38,062
in a situation like this--
we're going to keep it quiet.

353
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:39,564
But they're destroying
the school.

354
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:41,608
Let's hope that's
all they do, cadet.

355
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:43,651
I'm afraid this is
like an oil fire--

356
00:15:43,693 --> 00:15:45,570
we have to let it
burn itself out.

357
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:48,740
Oh, yeah, I forgot--
one of them started an oil fire.

358
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:55,705
So...

359
00:15:55,747 --> 00:15:57,998
did you see
any good movies lately?

360
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,209
Well, we just saw
Les Amants du Pont-Neuf.

361
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:01,377
Did you see it?

362
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:03,296
No.

363
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:06,173
Last movie I saw was

364
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:09,009
The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes
on cable.

365
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:11,679
Oh, my God! Kurt Russell!
Yes.

366
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:14,014
Oh, I had such a crush on him
in those Disney films.

367
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:17,017
I did, too--
especially in  Now You See It...

368
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:18,227
Now You Don't!

369
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:20,020
Oh, God...
Oh, he was so cute.

370
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:22,857
Did you see  The Strongest Man
in the World?
About 50 times.

371
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:26,611
Oh, my God!
I just wanted to reach out
and grab that tush.

372
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:28,404
I am so terrible.

373
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:32,116
Seriously, this
has got to stop.

374
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:34,285
I'm actually starting
to feel bad

375
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:37,497
and plus... I'm
kind of getting
bored creatively.

376
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:39,874
Oh, my God!

377
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:41,334
Is that a snake?
Stevie, don't.

378
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,127
Sucker.

379
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:46,422
Snake...

380
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:48,007
I'm an idiot.

381
00:16:58,476 --> 00:17:00,060
Oh...
Oh...

382
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:02,229
I'm so glad we decided
to have this dinner.

383
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:05,065
So am I.
I feel so much better now.

384
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:06,776
Better?

385
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:08,277
About you and your family.

386
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,904
What?

387
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:11,155
A-A-About Malcolm and Stevie

388
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:13,157
because they spend
so much time together,

389
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,368
and now that we've gotten
to know each other,

390
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:16,452
I just feel better.

391
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:18,162
Wait a minute.

392
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:20,373
You mean this wasn't about
you wanting to be friends?

393
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:21,541
Yes, it was.

394
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:23,167
No, it wasn't.

395
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:24,585
You were checking us out.

396
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:27,254
You wanted to see if we were
good enough for your family.

397
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:29,298
No, no, no. I-I wouldn't
put it that way.

398
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:32,301
I would, because
that's what you're doing.

399
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:34,136
How dare you!

400
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:35,513
You can't judge us.

401
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:36,681
You know,

402
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:38,516
you are not
so perfect yourself, lady.

403
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:41,185
Hell, you are one of the most
uptight, repressed people

404
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:42,520
I've ever met in my life.

405
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:46,106
Did you know that Kurt Russell
was the jungle boy

406
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:48,108
on  Gilligan's Island?

407
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,402
Don't change the subject.

408
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:50,486
We're having an
argument here.

409
00:17:50,528 --> 00:17:51,571
I yell at you;
you yell at me--

410
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:52,530
that's what you do.

411
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:53,614
What's wrong with you?

412
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:55,115
Whatever you say
is wrong with me

413
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:56,283
is what's wrong with me.

414
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:57,410
There-- problem solved.

415
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,221
Okay, that's just freaky.

416
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:19,515
Hey, I'm getting
good with my left.

417
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:20,808
Thanks, Stevie.

418
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:24,729
I... give up.

419
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:26,146
I'm going to...

420
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:28,148
the car.

421
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:37,366
Way to go, Reese.

422
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:39,118
Aw, geez!

423
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:50,254
Crying on... command...

424
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:53,173
got me... a cable modem.

425
00:18:54,592 --> 00:18:55,551
You have a real problem.

426
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:56,677
Have you never
yelled at anyone

427
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:57,971
in your entire life?

428
00:18:58,012 --> 00:18:59,555
I just don't see
what it accomplishes.

429
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:00,765
Are you kidding?

430
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:02,558
Most of the time,
if you're not yelling,

431
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,893
they're not listening.

432
00:19:03,935 --> 00:19:06,479
Lois, our situation
is difficult enough

433
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:10,566
without me adding
a bunch of negativity to it.

434
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:13,193
What situation? You mean Stevie?

435
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:15,488
He's fine!
He's not going to wither away

436
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:18,407
because you blow off steam
every once in a while.

437
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:22,286
Hey, why don't you give
both of you a break?

438
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:26,373
Go ahead, hit me.

439
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:27,875
Get it over with.

440
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:34,799
Ow... ow...

441
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:37,677
Let me... help you.

442
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:41,514
Reap...

443
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:43,182
the whirlwind!

444
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:49,229
Finally-- justice.

445
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:51,732
I mean, if he doesn't kill him.

446
00:19:55,486 --> 00:19:58,238
Stevie, what the hell
do you think you're doing?!

447
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,657
You are in so
much trouble!

448
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:01,492
This behavior is
totally unacceptable.

449
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:04,162
We are at a restaurant--
what is wrong with you?

450
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:06,706
Don't you take that tone
with me!

451
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:08,332
You just wait
till we get home!

452
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:09,876
He bruised the bone.

453
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:11,251
Oh, like you
didn't deserve it.

454
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:12,879
Good for you! I knew
you had it in you.

455
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,254
Shut your trap!

456
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,549
Excuse me, would
you mind please
keeping it down?

457
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,134
Would you mind
going to hell?

458
00:20:18,176 --> 00:20:19,886
And I absolutely did order tea!

459
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:23,263
How hard is it to remember
a stupid drink order, you idiot?

460
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:24,849
Kitty, there's going to be
some changes...

461
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:27,267
And you-- Mr. Ho Hos
in his sock drawer!

462
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:28,686
Who do you think
you're kidding?

463
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:30,312
Honey, you have
to pace yourself.

464
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:32,190
And another thing,
Don Juan,

465
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:34,108
there are two people
in that bed!

466
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:37,904
You know, I really don't
feel very good.

467
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:41,323
And I had it with your poker
nights and your idiot frien...

468
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:50,791
I think this is
where they nested.

469
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:53,293
I'd say we got off lucky.

470
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:55,295
This happened once
before in '72--

471
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:59,258
we had to bulldoze
the amphitheater.

472
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,305
It's Horton.

473
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:07,307
Hey, Horton, you okay?

474
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:09,518
What happened?

475
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:14,148
I've seen things, Francis...

476
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:17,568
terrible things...

477
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:20,238
and I... I think I'm engaged.

478
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:25,118
Come on, children,
quickly, quickly.
Those pants went

479
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:26,827
out of style in the '80s
and they were ugly back then.

480
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:28,204
Don't you give me that look.

481
00:21:28,246 --> 00:21:29,329
You got a eye problem?

482
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:30,998
Whoa. Interesting dinner.

483
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,000
Stevie beat the crap
out of Reese,

484
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:34,334
his dad got drunk,

485
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:37,337
and his mom's gone
totally psycho.

486
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:39,339
Oh, my God... we're contagious.

487
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:41,425
...the whole night staring
at the cocktail waitress.
