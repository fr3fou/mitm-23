1
00:00:02,370 -> 00:00:03,770
Okay, know something about my family.

2
00:00:04,570 -> 00:00:06,770
We are not leaving all together.

3
00:00:06,770 -> 00:00:08,850
But when we do, always a
wrong decision but persevering.

4
00:00:09,090 -> 00:00:12,770
When you say, all life prohibited
How's life who you mean?

5
00:00:13,250 -> 00:00:13,970
Mama, I'm going to fall to the floor!

6
00:00:14,570 -> 00:00:19,970
Never again will I order something.
I should have just not had!

7
00:00:20,290 -> 00:00:22,050
I can not tolerate such behavior.

8
00:00:22,290 -> 00:00:26,050
Believe it or not, I'd rather be with Dewey.
Just being with the babysitter!

9
00:00:27,090 -> 00:00:34,050
And then that bubble appeared and I started
follow but did not know where he was.

10
00:00:34,050 -> 00:00:37,170
Then I went to the bag and then
 I did not know where he was.

11
00:00:37,170 -> 00:00:38,770
And then I saw you
I thought maybe you could help me

12
00:00:38,970 -> 00:00:41,170
Because you helped another person in a movie.

13
00:00:41,690 -> 00:00:44,570
So if I can lend a hand,
will thank you.

14
00:00:47,770 -> 00:00:50,570
Thanks anyway

15
00:01:36,570 -> 00:01:38,770
95 degrees outside yesterday

16
00:01:38,770 -> 00:01:40,290
Equivalent to 110 degrees here

17
00:01:40,290 -> 00:01:42,770
In more heat, it's like an oven
and worse still we are without radio.

18
00:01:42,770 -> 00:01:44,570
Hal, stop to look back

19
00:01:44,690 -> 00:01:47,490
That car has been pursuing
3 miles ago

20
00:01:47,490 -> 00:01:49,170
Just cum and let it go

21
00:01:51,690 -> 00:01:53,170
Oh that making signs with lights

22
00:01:53,290 -> 00:01:54,770
Want it that way eh

23
00:01:56,770 -> 00:01:59,690
For God's Hal! He could have a gun!

24
00:01:59,810 -> 00:02:01,690
Just let it go

25
00:02:01,690 -> 00:02:03,170
Oh agreement ended.

26
00:02:03,690 -> 00:02:04,210
I say pass on this side

27
00:02:06,770 -> 00:02:09,170
Forward fucking sucking sugar!

28
00:02:09,810 -> 00:02:12,210
C'mon, it's just an accident that is
waiting to happen

29
00:02:17,210 -> 00:02:20,690
A, B, C, D. ...

30
00:02:20,690 -> 00:02:21,690
A, B, C, D. ...

31
00:02:23,410 -> 00:02:24,810
A, B, C, D. ...

32
00:02:25,810 -> 00:02:30,810
It's good that you have found,
not sure that a child is only here.

33
00:02:32,090 -> 00:02:34,810
Do not worry,
I'll take you home with your parents again

34
00:02:35,810 -> 00:02:37,810
Should be very worried

35
00:02:43,010 -> 00:02:43,810
Follow with E

36
00:02:43,810 -> 00:02:46,490
A, B, C, D, E

37
00:02:47,090 -> 00:02:48,490
I know

38
00:02:48,490 -> 00:02:50,490
A, B, C, D. ..

39
00:02:50,810 -> 00:02:54,810
A, B, C, D. ..

40
00:02:54,810 -> 00:02:57,810
Sugar preserves nutrients.

41
00:02:59,210 -> 00:03:01,010
How can something so simple be so delicious?

42
00:03:02,010 -> 00:03:04,010
Those things are nasty, Francis

43
00:03:04,010 -> 00:03:06,010
You have to be fancy eating them, yes,

44
00:03:06,010 -> 00:03:10,010
But for me the "Candy Cuack"
are a perfect meal

45
00:03:10,290 -> 00:03:11,610
I could eat up to 100

46
00:03:11,810 -> 00:03:14,690
No way
all that crap on your stomach would grow

47
00:03:14,690 -> 00:03:16,210
Not even the 50 would pass

48
00:03:16,210 -> 00:03:17,730
I'm afraid you're wrong Joe.

49
00:03:18,730 -> 00:03:22,730
Since I am a child I always
dissolve rapidly, never got fat.

50
00:03:22,730 -> 00:03:23,730
Actually, I ...

51
00:03:23,930 -> 00:03:26,730
It is sufieciente, shut up!

52
00:03:27,130 -> 00:03:35,730
always talk about how they can leave
this eating 100 or 100 of that

53
00:03:36,530 -> 00:03:41,010
The "cuacks" would expand.
You're an idiot if you think differently

54
00:03:42,530 -> 00:03:43,530
Well let me tell you something.

55
00:03:43,530 -> 00:03:49,530
If I say I can eat 100 cuacks,
 can assure you that my word is a guarantee.

56
00:03:50,530 -> 00:03:52,530
And no need to resort to personal attacks

57
00:03:53,530 -> 00:03:59,530
Because I hate going to the bathroom and check your
dirty boxers in the shower.

58
00:04:07,530 -> 00:04:09,530
This is so cool

59
00:04:09,730 -> 00:04:14,530
With a bit of dynamite around, fly around in the air.
The explosion would be great

60
00:04:14,530 -> 00:04:15,530
There would be nothing.

61
00:04:15,530 -> 00:04:17,530
Reese Yes, this is great.

62
00:04:17,610 -> 00:04:21,530
We trapped for hours
without food or air conditioning.

63
00:04:21,930 -> 00:04:23,130
I guess it could be worse

64
00:04:23,330 -> 00:04:25,810
Could be a boy in the middle
 the sun trying to bring order

65
00:04:27,730 -> 00:04:30,530
Why can not you just open a line?

66
00:04:30,530 -> 00:04:33,810
Miss,
crazy if you think you were unsuccessful in opening this road

67
00:04:33,930 -> 00:04:37,330
Yes, but if you just move those two cars would
a place to go

68
00:04:37,330 -> 00:04:39,330
I do not understand how they can be so stupid

69
00:04:39,330 -> 00:04:41,330
Lady, do not call the police stupid

70
00:04:42,130 -> 00:04:44,210
What is a law that now?

71
00:04:44,330 -> 00:04:47,250
See, long ago ate 7 pounds of potato chips
in a city

72
00:04:48,250 -> 00:04:50,650
So I think my body could
stand

73
00:04:50,650 -> 00:04:52,850
We are not talking about french fries Francis

74
00:04:52,930 -> 00:04:54,850
We are talking about pure sucrose

75
00:04:54,850 -> 00:05:00,450
The human body simply can not absorb
100 cuacks sugar!

76
00:05:00,450 -> 00:05:06,450
In extreme cases can the human body
stand but is only 75% confidence

77
00:05:12,450 -> 00:05:16,450
If you eat too much blood in your body
not flow and you pass out

78
00:05:18,050 -> 00:05:19,450
Gentlemen, gentlemen

79
00:05:19,930 -> 00:05:21,650
These arguments are useless

80
00:05:32,850 -> 00:05:34,650
One

81
00:05:37,250 -> 00:05:39,850
Look at them, only keep spinning

82
00:05:39,850 -> 00:05:42,850
There are a lot of cars full of people
are supposed to have to go somewhere

83
00:05:42,850 -> 00:05:44,850
And they just stay there
standing and talking.

84
00:05:44,530 -> 00:05:46,370
What Fight?

85
00:05:46,370 -> 00:05:47,970
Hey, let me clarify something

86
00:05:47,970 -> 00:05:49,250
This is a road car

87
00:05:49,250 -> 00:05:51,570
Are grown, do your job!

88
00:05:53,570 -> 00:05:55,570
"Although it is listening to me?

89
00:05:55,850 -> 00:05:56,850
It could be me

90
00:05:57,850 -> 00:06:00,450
Oh Hal, could not be any of us

91
00:06:00,650 -> 00:06:05,730
Noo, our car direct slides
transit, and got caught

92
00:06:06,970 -> 00:06:08,250
This totally sucks

93
00:06:08,770 -> 00:06:10,850
More than an hour ago we're here!

94
00:06:10,970 -> 00:06:13,770
What is the point of going around in the middle
traffic?

95
00:06:13,770 -> 00:06:15,770
You see, you can find things like this

96
00:06:16,770 -> 00:06:18,770
Smells like dirty feet

97
00:06:18,770 -> 00:06:20,770
Reese, Can we go back to the car? feel
I'm dying

98
00:06:20,770 -> 00:06:21,770
Ice Cream!

99
00:06:24,770 -> 00:06:26,450
Go away!

100
00:06:26,450 -> 00:06:28,450
No ice cream truck

101
00:06:29,450 -> 00:06:32,450
He's lying. There are tons
ice cream in there

102
00:06:33,370 -> 00:06:36,450
The ice cream truck is not for sale

103
00:06:37,490 -> 00:06:41,090
Law is against him to sell them ice cream
the traffic!

104
00:06:41,650 -> 00:06:42,690
That's too bad

105
00:06:42,770 -> 00:06:45,090
You can make money selling
the boys

106
00:06:45,090 -> 00:06:46,450
That's the point.

107
00:06:46,690 -> 00:06:48,770
You're evil!, You malvadoo!

108
00:06:50,450 -> 00:06:53,090
I see no way to discuss
This significantly

109
00:06:56,450 -> 00:06:57,890
You're a damn!

110
00:06:57,890 -> 00:06:59,570
Calm down, no we can do

111
00:06:59,890 -> 00:07:02,570
Yes there is, I can, I can ...

112
00:07:07,570 -> 00:07:09,570
And I know about the idiot who is also

113
00:07:10,290 -> 00:07:12,570
Hey, you're talking about my brother.

114
00:07:13,090 -> 00:07:14,090
Very good.

115
00:07:14,090 -> 00:07:15,170
I'm Jessica

116
00:07:15,290 -> 00:07:16,370
My car is out there

117
00:07:16,570 -> 00:07:17,690
Malcolm, my back to everything.

118
00:07:17,690 -> 00:07:19,690
Want to go to check the cars out there?

119
00:07:19,690 -> 00:07:20,690
Insurance

120
00:07:20,690 -> 00:07:22,970
You know, my dad pretty much built.

121
00:07:25,290 -> 00:07:26,770
What time is it now?

122
00:07:27,290 -> 00:07:28,370
There are still 4 o'clock

123
00:07:28,370 -> 00:07:31,290
You have to wait at least
a minute to change the time ...

124
00:07:31,290 -> 00:07:32,290
What time is it in Chinese?

125
00:07:32,290 -> 00:07:35,810
Well, honey .. I think are the 20 -

126
00:07:35,810 -> 00:07:36,770
Are you from China?

127
00:07:37,410 -> 00:07:38,770
Well .. no ..

128
00:07:39,290 -> 00:07:40,090
Is Chinatown in China?

129
00:07:40,090 -> 00:07:44,370
Honey, if you wish to answer a question
first you have to wait ...

130
00:07:44,490 -> 00:07:46,610
What is this tattoo?

131
00:07:46,770 -> 00:07:48,770
You know? I need to buy a pack of cigarettes

132
00:07:49,010 -> 00:07:52,610
For the first time in 20 years

133
00:07:58,890 -> 00:08:00,610
Hurry please

134
00:08:29,610 -> 00:08:31,610
Hello

135
00:08:40,210 -> 00:08:42,210
Think Lois

136
00:08:42,210 -> 00:08:46,210
I stopped to tie my shoes in the parking lot

137
00:08:46,210 -> 00:08:50,010
If I had not done
20 seconds would be along the road

138
00:08:50,090 -> 00:08:55,210
Would be 200 yards ahead and
would not dissolve in the heat

139
00:08:55,290 -> 00:08:58,290
And if you had not ever had your body here
Dewey would have had to

140
00:08:58,610 -> 00:09:00,210
It's all mathematical, Hal.

141
00:09:00,210 -> 00:09:01,210
Lady?

142
00:09:01,210 -> 00:09:02,210
Yes?

143
00:09:02,530 -> 00:09:03,890
Did you ask your supervisor?

144
00:09:04,010 -> 00:09:06,810
Yes, but this phone is only for emergencies to
Mrs. roadside

145
00:09:07,210 -> 00:09:09,210
I can not get open the way

146
00:09:09,330 -> 00:09:11,610
Well, but I have to communicate with
the nanny ...

147
00:09:11,610 -> 00:09:14,010
According look, just leave me
talk to your supervisor

148
00:09:14,210 -> 00:09:15,410
One time Madam

149
00:09:16,210 -> 00:09:18,610
Hello? I am the supervisor.

150
00:09:18,610 -> 00:09:19,810
Do not be misleading

151
00:09:20,290 -> 00:09:22,410
Only these changing your voice!

152
00:09:22,410 -> 00:09:23,410
No, I'm doing.

153
00:09:23,410 -> 00:09:25,210
I really am the supervisor

154
00:09:25,330 -> 00:09:26,610
You can not do this!

155
00:09:26,610 -> 00:09:27,610
Lady look I'm about to be replaced by
the machine.

156
00:09:27,730 -> 00:09:30,130
I can do what I want very well

157
00:09:31,410 -> 00:09:33,130
Where do you think you will miss?

158
00:09:33,130 -> 00:09:35,930
Okay, my dad is a researcher with
ID

159
00:09:35,930 -> 00:09:36,930
Oh there is

160
00:09:36,930 -> 00:09:38,010
Hi Daddy!

161
00:09:42,330 -> 00:09:44,010
According

162
00:09:44,410 -> 00:09:47,010
Wow! Your father is a researcher
car crashes

163
00:09:48,450 -> 00:09:50,130
This is a secret Malcolm

164
00:09:50,130 -> 00:09:53,410
View here and yell at all and they are your parents

165
00:09:53,530 -> 00:09:55,130
Hi Daddy!

166
00:09:58,130 -> 00:10:02,130
Very good! She's cute, intelligent and up
lies to the police

167
00:10:02,450 -> 00:10:04,130
Might be above my head

168
00:10:43,930 -> 00:10:48,450
I've been moving from city to city
is very difficult for me to make friends

169
00:10:48,450 -> 00:10:50,450
So yes, I have to get out of here
I guess.

170
00:10:51,250 -> 00:10:52,650
But you're not in my situation

171
00:10:56,250 -> 00:10:58,250
Okay I'll leave here with the police.

172
00:10:58,330 -> 00:10:59,530
All right.

173
00:11:33,530 -> 00:11:34,930
62 !!!!!

174
00:11:37,930 -> 00:11:38,930
61 !!!!!!

175
00:11:39,930 -> 00:11:40,930
62!

176
00:11:41,930 -> 00:11:42,930
63!!

177
00:11:43,930 -> 00:11:46,130
You feel like God with this view

178
00:11:46,930 -> 00:11:48,530
Atravezarlo hate bush

179
00:11:48,530 -> 00:11:50,650
Not serve in any way.

180
00:11:50,930 -> 00:11:53,850
See how we can protect or something?

181
00:11:54,130 -> 00:11:55,450
Why are we here?

182
00:11:55,450 -> 00:11:56,930
Just looking at the views

183
00:12:00,450 -> 00:12:02,330
Look at that crazy woman

184
00:12:05,450 -> 00:12:08,530
Well, tell me about that special kind ...

185
00:12:09,050 -> 00:12:09,650
It's horrible

186
00:12:09,650 -> 00:12:11,170
I am surrounded by stupid boys

187
00:12:11,330 -> 00:12:14,130
2 times I did the math
and no one was at my level

188
00:12:14,130 -> 00:12:16,530
I did all these college classes y. ..

189
00:12:16,530 -> 00:12:17,570
Oh what a nightmare!

190
00:12:17,570 -> 00:12:19,570
You are not careful doing all
these tasks Harvard silly!

191
00:12:19,570 -> 00:12:20,930
You do not understand ...

192
00:12:21,330 -> 00:12:24,450
Malcolm Even more geniuses
do not stop for an hour and a half

193
00:12:26,450 -> 00:12:27,450
Really all it does is
push yourself over

194
00:12:27,970 -> 00:12:30,450
Anyone would expect from most in my situation

195
00:12:30,450 -> 00:12:32,650
Today is the perfect test. Look at this mess!

196
00:12:32,970 -> 00:12:34,650
What will happen to us?

197
00:12:36,970 -> 00:12:40,970
If it were not for this,
we would never have known.

198
00:12:50,970 -> 00:12:52,250
I never felt it coming!

199
00:12:52,450 -> 00:12:54,450
This girl is amazing!

200
00:12:59,450 -> 00:13:00,970
Broken legs

201
00:13:02,770 -> 00:13:04,970
He then went to my head asking

202
00:13:05,050 -> 00:13:07,450
How long do I have?

203
00:13:07,450 -> 00:13:08,450
What have I done with my life?

204
00:13:08,450 -> 00:13:10,450
Tell me, what is my contribution?

205
00:13:10,450 -> 00:13:11,970
You go home at night

206
00:13:11,970 -> 00:13:15,370
Knowing you are helping the world
to be a better place

207
00:13:15,370 -> 00:13:17,490
Following line by line

208
00:13:17,570 -> 00:13:19,170
And that's a real man

209
00:13:19,490 -> 00:13:23,970
If only I could feel that
feeling of accomplishment for once in my life

210
00:13:24,370 -> 00:13:27,970
Do you know how special you are not?

211
00:13:31,970 -> 00:13:40,970
C. .. Y. .. X. .. W. ..

212
00:13:42,170 -> 00:13:43,770
Ok let me explain

213
00:13:43,970 -> 00:13:45,970
We've been waiting all afternoon for a crane.

214
00:13:45,890 -> 00:13:48,370
And now, the crane is here

215
00:13:48,370 -> 00:13:49,370
That's true.

216
00:13:50,170 -> 00:13:52,370
And the man operating the crane
is here too!

217
00:13:52,890 -> 00:13:53,570
That's right.

218
00:13:56,570 -> 00:13:59,570
So why nothing is happening!

219
00:13:59,890 -> 00:14:04,570
Look we can not touch anything until the
researcher send us a report.

220
00:14:04,570 -> 00:14:06,170
Last time that we are here, where?

221
00:14:06,690 -> 00:14:09,170
Well that's something the department. No
it's my job to know.

222
00:14:13,170 -> 00:14:18,170
... .. Turn the crane!

223
00:14:19,170 -> 00:14:20,170
You can not tell me what I have to do

224
00:14:28,170 -> 00:14:30,370
Hey not so fast friend

225
00:14:30,570 -> 00:14:32,090
What do you think?

226
00:14:32,090 -> 00:14:33,090
Nothing just watching!

227
00:14:34,090 -> 00:14:35,490
What the hell happens?

228
00:14:35,410 -> 00:14:37,010
This kid was trying to get
in your truck.

229
00:14:37,170 -> 00:14:38,370
Let go!
I just wanted ice cream!

230
00:14:38,370 -> 00:14:40,690
You deserve no ice cream.

231
00:14:40,690 -> 00:14:43,170
And you do not deserve to be an ice cream!

232
00:14:44,370 -> 00:14:46,210
Come here bastard!

233
00:14:46,210 -> 00:14:48,210
That's what you get for your trouble.

234
00:14:49,170 -> 00:14:51,170
Sell everything in my country!

235
00:15:26,210 -> 00:15:29,170
It seems that the human body
can only eat 96 cuacks

236
00:15:29,210 -> 00:15:32,210
Checkmate!

237
00:15:32,490 -> 00:15:36,210
Let Francis. only 4 more.
You can do it!

238
00:15:36,210 -> 00:15:40,210
I can not. Killing Cuacks ...

239
00:15:41,210 -> 00:15:44,410
Hey, nobody said he had to
eat all cuacks.

240
00:15:44,490 -> 00:15:47,690
They just had to be inside your body
Right?

241
00:15:47,690 -> 00:15:49,690
Yes, if it's true ...

242
00:15:58,690 -> 00:16:00,690
100 cuacks!!

243
00:16:05,690 -> 00:16:07,690
You worked.

244
00:16:07,690 -> 00:16:08,890
Where do you Francis?

245
00:16:08,890 -> 00:16:11,890
Hey, I bet David
can eat a thousand gut reactions

246
00:16:11,890 -> 00:16:12,930
Impossible

247
00:16:13,810 -> 00:16:16,410
David is a great guy,
But a thousand grains?

248
00:16:16,690 -> 00:16:18,410
Only these delirious

249
00:16:19,090 -> 00:16:23,890
Such are the things that make you not
recognize that whenever you're wrong.

250
00:16:23,890 -> 00:16:28,930
Oh come on, you're talking about?

251
00:16:36,930 -> 00:16:38,410
Here's your ice cream Carl

252
00:16:39,090 -> 00:16:41,010
Karen yours here

253
00:16:42,290 -> 00:16:44,010
And here his Lord Miles.

254
00:16:45,410 -> 00:16:47,010
That man left us no choice.

255
00:16:53,010 -> 00:16:56,010
Prees Green!

256
00:16:59,010 -> 00:17:01,010
Lady out of there.

257
00:17:01,130 -> 00:17:03,130
You or they can move this thing!

258
00:17:03,130 -> 00:17:06,530
Step off the lift and then we'll talk.

259
00:17:06,530 -> 00:17:08,330
Do not you dare lie!

260
00:17:08,330 -> 00:17:10,610
Well not want to hear, I'll be rude.

261
00:17:10,610 -> 00:17:12,730
You're out of control monster

262
00:17:12,730 -> 00:17:13,610
I see it all the time

263
00:17:13,610 -> 00:17:15,610
But guess what?

264
00:17:15,610 -> 00:17:16,330
This is a traffic jam.

265
00:17:16,410 -> 00:17:17,410
It is beyond your control

266
00:17:17,450 -> 00:17:19,250
Then you can not send anyone.

267
00:17:19,450 -> 00:17:21,810
You can not insult and expect to be heard

268
00:17:21,810 -> 00:17:22,330
But I. ..

269
00:17:22,450 -> 00:17:24,850
This will end,
 When you have to finish!

270
00:17:24,850 -> 00:17:26,210
You have to accept it!

271
00:17:26,210 -> 00:17:28,930
There is absolutely nothing you can do.

272
00:17:47,450 -> 00:17:50,930
"Whose dog is this?!

273
00:17:51,530 -> 00:17:53,930
I want to know who this dog!

274
00:17:55,930 -> 00:17:57,930
This trapped inside with the windows closed!

275
00:17:58,050 -> 00:18:00,930
Yesterday 90 degrees out here!

276
00:18:02,930 -> 00:18:05,450
Okay, anyone concerned about the dog!

277
00:18:06,250 -> 00:18:08,930
So I guess no one will bother
if you just do it!

278
00:18:14,850 -> 00:18:17,930
Ohh, do not be scared puppy

279
00:18:19,050 -> 00:18:20,050
Everything will be biennial ...

280
00:18:35,050 -> 00:18:37,050
Oh, poor thing ...

281
00:18:38,530 -> 00:18:40,050
Okay, understood.

282
00:18:41,050 -> 00:18:43,050
It is good to do well from time to time.

283
00:18:43,930 -> 00:18:46,050
A life is a life ...

284
00:18:47,050 -> 00:18:49,050
Míra how are you eh ..

285
00:18:49,530 -> 00:18:58,050
There is, go home.

286
00:19:06,050 -> 00:19:08,050
I'm impressed

287
00:19:09,050 -> 00:19:10,570
Those working for the good of someone

288
00:19:10,050 -> 00:19:12,050
We used to do long ago
depending on others.

289
00:19:12,050 -> 00:19:13,450
Hey, you! Where are you!?

290
00:19:13,450 -> 00:19:15,250
You know, I was thinking ...

291
00:19:15,250 -> 00:19:17,050
Maybe one could see us.

292
00:19:17,050 -> 00:19:18,050
It would be great

293
00:19:18,050 -> 00:19:19,050
"CANADA"

294
00:19:19,170 -> 00:19:21,450
What? Are you from Canada?

295
00:19:21,570 -> 00:19:22,930
We are here on vacation

296
00:19:28,130 -> 00:19:29,930
Why do not you tell me?

297
00:19:29,970 -> 00:19:32,570
Because'd gone anyway
all day having fun.

298
00:19:32,570 -> 00:19:34,450
I knew this was very good
to be true

299
00:19:35,370 -> 00:19:40,450
Why would someone like me meet someone
smart, funny, other than my family ...

300
00:19:40,450 -> 00:19:41,450
Be positive Malcolm

301
00:19:41,450 -> 00:19:46,450
It was amazing! It is OK to have fun with
something just for a while.

302
00:19:47,250 -> 00:19:49,170
Vamos! The good time.

303
00:19:49,450 -> 00:19:50,850
No, not a good time.

304
00:19:50,970 -> 00:19:51,850
You just said it was fun!

305
00:19:51,970 -> 00:19:54,450
That was a way of saying that
spending just a little good.

306
00:19:55,450 -> 00:19:57,450
Yes, problem solved

307
00:19:57,490 -> 00:20:01,490
Get in the car children

308
00:20:02,170 -> 00:20:04,450
Malcolm! Reese!

309
00:20:05,490 -> 00:20:07,490
I have to go.

310
00:20:09,490 -> 00:20:11,490
Hal Hurry!

311
00:20:11,490 -> 00:20:14,970
I'm waiting for my turn

312
00:20:15,050 -> 00:20:15,490
Malcolm

313
00:20:18,450 -> 00:20:21,490
Malcolm! This is my phone number.
Call me!

314
00:20:49,490 -> 00:20:54,450
That was so funny!

315
00:20:54,450 -> 00:20:57,490
We saw a dog in a traffic jam
Traffic

316
00:20:57,490 -> 00:20:58,970
It was so cool.

317
00:20:58,970 -> 00:20:59,970
Reese stole the ice cream maker ice cream!

318
00:21:00,170 -> 00:21:02,970
We met people from another country!

319
00:21:05,970 -> 00:21:06,970
Boy we

320
00:21:09,690 -> 00:21:11,770
Bye Santa!

321
00:21:21,370 -> 00:21:22,370
Hi Mom

322
00:21:22,490 -> 00:21:24,370
Dewey, Where's the nanny?

323
00:21:24,370 -> 00:21:25,370
It was

324
00:21:25,370 -> 00:21:27,370
Scare "another nanny?

325
00:21:27,570 -> 00:21:29,370
What is wrong with you boy?

326
00:21:29,890 -> 00:21:32,370
Then I saw that was missing mom ...
and then ...

9999
00:00:0,500 -> 00:00:2,00
<font color="#ffff00" size=14> www.tvsubtitles.net </ font>
