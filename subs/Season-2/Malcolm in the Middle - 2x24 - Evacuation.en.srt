1
00:00:14,504 -> 00:00:15,336
Got bricks?

2
00:00:26,487 -> 00:00:29,015
Dewey Hold! 20 seconds
to break the record!

3
00:01:05,188 -> 00:01:06,095
Here we go.

4
00:01:06,674 -> 00:01:08,440
Hal ... is beautiful!

5
00:01:09,157 -> 00:01:13,720
They can not take it, or sit, or jump
or come until next year!

6
00:01:13,960 -> 00:01:15,128
What's that?

7
00:01:16,200 -> 00:01:18,466
Dewey, "We took the old to the dump?

8
00:01:18,824 -> 00:01:20,382
No, I prefer to see pictures.

9
00:01:20,609 -> 00:01:21,488
Are you kidding?

10
00:01:22,076 -> 00:01:24,183
We're talking about
the city dumpster.

11
00:01:24,670 -> 00:01:27,999
Mountains of garbage
plug to the best of your sight.

12
00:01:28,345 -> 00:01:31,341
Huge flies that will hide the sun.

13
00:01:32,127 -> 00:01:32,676
Really?

14
00:01:33,622 -> 00:01:36,520
The last time I saw a gull 20 kilos
who had a dog at the peak.

15
00:01:40,705 -> 00:01:41,258
Vamos!

16
00:01:43,705 -> 00:01:44,482
Hi guys.

17
00:01:44,700 -> 00:01:45,634
Sorry I'm late.

18
00:01:47,172 -> 00:01:50,075
Stevie and I finished work
geometry, we developed 2 weeks.

19
00:01:50,075 -> 00:01:50,768
Congratulations!

20
00:01:50,983 -> 00:01:51,808
Are punished.

21
00:01:52,771 -> 00:01:53,404
What?

22
00:01:53,404 -> 00:01:54,441
Came half an hour later.

23
00:01:54,687 -> 00:01:58,281
Going to come back at 3 to help with the sofa.
Your father and Reese almost die.

24
00:01:58,281 -> 00:01:58,910
Yes, but ...

25
00:01:58,910 -> 00:01:59,800
No buts.

26
00:02:00,199 -> 00:02:03,624
You are punished. Two weeks in your room
no tv, friends or telephone.

27
00:02:04,093 -> 00:02:06,062
I was doing my homework.
I thought it was fine!

28
00:02:06,062 -> 00:02:09,057
You do not have to decide
what is right yet.

29
00:02:09,057 -> 00:02:12,049
I looked into his eyes and promised,
are punished.

30
00:02:12,851 -> 00:02:14,385
This is totally unfair!

31
00:02:16,777 -> 00:02:18,577
When I sat
over tar?

32
00:02:19,391 -> 00:02:22,457
(8) And when we come to the dustbin,
this is what we'll see ... (8)

33
00:02:22,699 -> 00:02:25,499
(8) Toilets broken ... (8)

34
00:02:25,499 -> 00:02:27,870
(8) Four wheels worn ... (8)

35
00:02:27,870 -> 00:02:28,870
(8) Magazines dirty ... (8)

36
00:02:28,870 -> 00:02:29,938
(8) Borrat old ... (8)

37
00:02:29,938 -> 00:02:34,040
(8) and a robot that lacks the nose ... (8)

38
00:02:36,952 -> 00:02:37,448
Sorry ...

39
00:02:38,218 -> 00:02:40,308
Where can we pull this couch?

40
00:02:49,470 -> 00:02:50,830
For the love of ...

41
00:02:52,341 -> 00:02:54,059
Even saw it fall.

42
00:02:56,573 -> 00:02:57,111
Well, son ...

43
00:02:57,842 -> 00:02:59,229
I guess our
work is already done.

44
00:03:04,724 -> 00:03:05,807
You are so dead ...

45
00:03:06,341 -> 00:03:09,714
Francis know that she could not go out with Laura
if not find someone for her sister.

46
00:03:09,915 -> 00:03:11,747
So just try to enjoy the event.

47
00:03:12,445 -> 00:03:13,386
He is 12 years!

48
00:03:13,386 -> 00:03:15,002
Hi guys,
Would you like tattoos?

49
00:03:15,768 -> 00:03:18,736
It may not be the girl of your
dreams but try to have fun.

50
00:03:18,736 -> 00:03:19,718
How can you do this?

51
00:03:20,044 -> 00:03:20,746
We ...

52
00:03:20,976 -> 00:03:22,326
You made me worse ...

53
00:03:22,662 -> 00:03:23,645
I think you deserve this.

54
00:03:24,188 -> 00:03:25,614
"Based on what?

55
00:03:26,206 -> 00:03:28,794
My friend is
telling them to shut up!

56
00:03:29,281 -> 00:03:32,267
He says nobody cares
how much weight you can lift!

57
00:03:33,720 -> 00:03:36,498
Now we know that
Cows can not swim.

58
00:03:40,705 -> 00:03:45,035
This is ridiculous, "Since when
farsista word is a provocation?

59
00:03:45,035 -> 00:03:47,589
I've done nothing except
be a good friend for you.

60
00:03:47,589 -> 00:03:50,334
See Francis,
I will not argue with you.

61
00:03:50,334 -> 00:03:53,243
You do this or I'll turn
the face of a coup!

62
00:03:53,705 -> 00:03:56,816
See? Whenever I give a
argument you resort to violence.

63
00:03:57,238 -> 00:03:58,200
I just want to make that clear.

64
00:04:01,681 -> 00:04:03,017
Yummy!

65
00:04:03,017 -> 00:04:06,194
This ice cream is a wonderful thing
for some of us.

66
00:04:06,428 -> 00:04:11,537
If Reese. You eat ice cream, but not me
thanks for clarifying the situation.

67
00:04:12,568 -> 00:04:13,171
I go.

68
00:04:14,064 -> 00:04:16,099
Bits of candy ...

69
00:04:16,099 -> 00:04:17,366
Are not your favorites, Malcolm?

70
00:04:17,858 -> 00:04:20,179
I'm scrubbing the
back on your pillow.

71
00:04:22,873 -> 00:04:24,968
Heaven. Reese! What did you do?

72
00:04:24,968 -> 00:04:28,826
Lord, we're evacuating the area and
to leave the house immediately.

73
00:04:28,826 -> 00:04:29,483
What?

74
00:04:29,483 -> 00:04:30,550
"Evacuate, why?

75
00:04:30,550 -> 00:04:34,122
Inition has been a toxic substance.
Derailed a train.

76
00:04:34,378 -> 00:04:35,347
And how did that happen?

77
00:04:35,347 -> 00:04:37,875
It seems some idiot left
a couch on the tracks.

78
00:04:38,862 -> 00:04:39,768
I wonder if ...

79
00:04:39,768 -> 00:04:40,828
Be careful, son.

80
00:04:41,233 -> 00:04:42,076
Do not sweat.

81
00:04:44,594 -> 00:04:45,191
Again ...

82
00:04:45,701 -> 00:04:49,840
If you do not need medical care
IMMEDIATELY seeking a free bed.

83
00:04:49,840 -> 00:04:53,141
Keep calm, and wait
receive instructions.

84
00:04:53,141 -> 00:04:54,387
Do you watch this?

85
00:04:54,822 -> 00:04:58,285
I hope you find the person responsible
and hang on the thumbs.

86
00:05:00,127 -> 00:05:02,900
Hey, buddy, do not you think
are exaggerating?

87
00:05:02,900 -> 00:05:06,642
My family is constantly
exposed to hazardous substances ...

88
00:05:07,342 -> 00:05:09,894
I remember I lit smoke
to kill flies ...

89
00:05:09,894 -> 00:05:11,975
... Of the nursery when
Dewey my son slept.

90
00:05:12,522 -> 00:05:13,826
I can smell colors.

91
00:05:14,565 -> 00:05:19,382
Lord, 2 cars out there that are
throw sulfuric acid and sodium sulfate.

92
00:05:19,827 -> 00:05:22,191
You can damage your throat and
kidneys in seconds.

93
00:05:22,191 -> 00:05:23,316
But not quite mortal.

94
00:05:23,548 -> 00:05:26,851
You may have an artificial throat,
but still be alive.

95
00:05:26,851 -> 00:05:28,209
That would be so cool!

96
00:05:28,790 -> 00:05:31,251
My name is Reese. What are you looking?

97
00:05:31,251 -> 00:05:31,960
Son, please ...

98
00:05:32,384 -> 00:05:33,751
Has anyone died yet?

99
00:05:33,751 -> 00:05:34,953
Not that I know.

100
00:05:34,953 -> 00:05:36,532
What if the wind changes?

101
00:05:36,758 -> 00:05:38,766
Will contaminated water,
What about food?

102
00:05:39,635 -> 00:05:40,781
And what about all
medical staff?

103
00:05:40,781 -> 00:05:42,857
How sabemosque these
people at risk?

104
00:05:42,857 -> 00:05:46,662
Sorry. Not all the answers
I'm just a high school student!

105
00:05:56,956 -> 00:05:58,844
Are we going to ask tonight?

106
00:05:59,096 -> 00:06:02,359
Because they will happen. It is the only table
in which there had been aroused.

107
00:06:02,722 -> 00:06:04,958
How about some donuts?
Lonely girl ...

108
00:06:10,349 -> 00:06:11,187
What about school?

109
00:06:11,469 -> 00:06:13,221
You're blocking my light!

110
00:06:22,661 -> 00:06:23,268
Look at this.

111
00:06:23,754 -> 00:06:27,677
An idiot left the store open.
See all vessels that are here.

112
00:06:28,133 -> 00:06:29,603
And what will you do with them?

113
00:06:29,882 -> 00:06:31,815
Save for a future friend.

114
00:06:32,802 -> 00:06:35,349
What place so bad!
This bed smells like pee!

115
00:06:35,785 -> 00:06:38,159
Well. We will have to fend for
with what is there.

116
00:06:38,159 -> 00:06:38,645
Where you going?

117
00:06:38,645 -> 00:06:40,152
I'll just take a walk.

118
00:06:40,152 -> 00:06:42,511
You're not going anywhere.
You are still punished.

119
00:06:42,511 -> 00:06:43,178
What?

120
00:06:43,602 -> 00:06:44,039
Here?

121
00:06:44,039 -> 00:06:44,856
That's right.

122
00:06:45,266 -> 00:06:47,102
Look around
this is a gym!

123
00:06:47,102 -> 00:06:48,506
Do not change what you did.

124
00:06:48,755 -> 00:06:50,323
Mom, can we all die!

125
00:06:50,323 -> 00:06:54,590
Then you will be saved from punishment, but
now I want to see your ass on that table.

126
00:06:57,160 -> 00:06:58,074
Ya!

127
00:07:10,123 -> 00:07:10,891
Sorry ...

128
00:07:11,250 -> 00:07:11,681
Sorry ...

129
00:07:11,681 -> 00:07:14,795
I was just wondering if there was
something I could do to help.

130
00:07:15,043 -> 00:07:19,225
Not that there's a reason
I just want to do my duty.

131
00:07:19,225 -> 00:07:20,801
Now we have everything under control.

132
00:07:20,801 -> 00:07:22,078
There must be something.

133
00:07:22,078 -> 00:07:25,952
I do not care who is dirty, absurd
or to endanger my life.

134
00:07:25,952 -> 00:07:27,905
Appreciate that just go back to your area.

135
00:07:27,905 -> 00:07:28,611
Please!

136
00:07:28,611 -> 00:07:31,466
You have to find some
way I find it useful!

137
00:07:31,738 -> 00:07:34,280
I have to relieve suffering
of these people.

138
00:07:34,887 -> 00:07:37,685
They should know that I am at your
willingness to help!

139
00:07:40,746 -> 00:07:42,039
That's for the defense?

140
00:07:42,039 -> 00:07:45,690
I have also a whistle and
I am ready to use.

141
00:07:50,340 -> 00:07:53,848
I would love to give you a little but I think
you should ask your parents first.

142
00:07:54,276 -> 00:07:55,130
I can not.

143
00:07:55,130 -> 00:07:55,909
They're dead.

144
00:07:56,634 -> 00:07:57,025
What?

145
00:07:57,424 -> 00:07:59,035
He killed the toxic cloud.

146
00:07:59,035 -> 00:08:00,185
Can I have one?

147
00:08:00,185 -> 00:08:02,024
My God! Pobresito ...

148
00:08:02,709 -> 00:08:05,057
Suffocated. It was horrible.

149
00:08:05,472 -> 00:08:06,790
Can I have one with nuts?

150
00:08:07,599 -> 00:08:08,639
Of course dear.

151
00:08:10,818 -> 00:08:13,087
NOTICE: We have reported a
distribution of toxic substances ...

152
00:08:14,315 -> 00:08:14,914
Where do they go?

153
00:08:15,225 -> 00:08:16,613
A couple of hours ...

154
00:08:16,613 -> 00:08:18,007
Did they take the car?

155
00:08:18,302 -> 00:08:21,239
Hey, you went to the bathroom,
gave them the opportunity.

156
00:08:21,462 -> 00:08:22,491
That's it.

157
00:08:22,724 -> 00:08:24,721
Grab your books,
we go from here.

158
00:08:24,721 -> 00:08:26,143
No, I want dinner.

159
00:08:26,426 -> 00:08:27,258
We're going.

160
00:08:27,258 -> 00:08:29,349
I'm not going to have dinner!

161
00:08:31,332 -> 00:08:33,004
Could you lower your voice, please?

162
00:08:33,004 -> 00:08:36,161
I liked you better when
chateabamos online!

163
00:08:36,928 -> 00:08:40,124
Well, me do not go that nonsense.
I have 3 younger brothers ...

164
00:08:40,507 -> 00:08:44,219
and I know all the tricks
So get up and vamosnos.

165
00:08:44,219 -> 00:08:47,893
No, punish Laura if I'm going home.
Believe that we are together.

166
00:08:47,893 -> 00:08:49,002
"And what do I care?

167
00:08:49,002 -> 00:08:51,499
Let me tell you something about your sister.
Not like you at all.

168
00:08:51,499 -> 00:08:52,955
Treats you like a fool.

169
00:08:57,885 -> 00:09:00,119
So.

170
00:09:01,357 -> 00:09:02,777
And it's not your fault.

171
00:09:02,777 -> 00:09:07,522
I mean, do not deserve that. Is it
you have a problem.

172
00:09:07,522 -> 00:09:11,386
I'm sure you have quality
people do not need ...

173
00:09:11,386 -> 00:09:13,136
Moza !...¿ can meet us here?

174
00:09:13,136 -> 00:09:14,007
Yes?

175
00:09:14,303 -> 00:09:17,947
A double hamburger,
with fries and a milkshake.

176
00:09:21,059 -> 00:09:25,241
Were trapped in the car and
I went to seek help and ran ... I ran ... and ran.

177
00:09:25,241 -> 00:09:30,429
But I fell ... and when I woke up I
had caught the man in the ambulance.

178
00:09:31,023 -> 00:09:32,169
And your parents were ...?

179
00:09:35,648 -> 00:09:37,151
Poor little boy!

180
00:09:38,333 -> 00:09:39,732
What fun!

181
00:09:40,105 -> 00:09:41,353
What about you?

182
00:09:41,601 -> 00:09:42,904
Give it to him!

183
00:09:44,006 -> 00:09:46,694
Well we do not know ... what
the best we can.

184
00:09:46,963 -> 00:09:47,498
Thanks.

185
00:09:49,226 -> 00:09:53,506
And because of these disasters ever
are children who suffer most.

186
00:09:53,983 -> 00:09:55,928
No, no, no ... not him.

187
00:09:55,928 -> 00:09:56,958
Is punished.

188
00:10:04,832 -> 00:10:06,413
You may need a cup, friend.

189
00:10:07,120 -> 00:10:08,606
Great, thanks.

190
00:10:08,606 -> 00:10:10,566
I wish it were that simple.

191
00:10:11,006 -> 00:10:12,207
What do you mean? I have thirst.

192
00:10:12,524 -> 00:10:15,321
"That truck of fruit is yours?

193
00:10:15,321 -> 00:10:16,322
Yes.

194
00:10:16,712 -> 00:10:17,120
Why?

195
00:10:17,784 -> 00:10:19,318
Take a stroll.

196
00:10:22,371 -> 00:10:24,957
That's it ... with this no longer
More should be disturbed.

197
00:10:25,210 -> 00:10:27,598
Is there too much current,
I shut the window?

198
00:10:27,598 -> 00:10:30,382
No, we're fine. Thank you for your help.

199
00:10:30,382 -> 00:10:34,209
Well for me it is a nuisance.
We must help each other.

200
00:10:34,652 -> 00:10:36,871
This is what should
look people.

201
00:10:37,217 -> 00:10:40,923
No homes of witches, in pointing
with your finger and find the culprit!

202
00:10:42,321 -> 00:10:45,005
And for that we are adults,
Cute Is it true?

203
00:10:45,005 -> 00:10:46,443
Want to tell you a story?

204
00:10:46,443 -> 00:10:48,412
Dad, can you tell him to go?

205
00:10:49,457 -> 00:10:50,942
It's beautiful!

206
00:10:55,847 -> 00:10:58,399
Excuse me, found the child
whose parents died?

207
00:10:58,730 -> 00:10:59,379
Not yet.

208
00:10:59,603 -> 00:11:02,520
Sorry, You said ... died?

209
00:11:02,520 -> 00:11:04,630
Yes, killed the gas cloud.

210
00:11:04,630 -> 00:11:05,852
My God!

211
00:11:06,054 -> 00:11:09,366
The child's mother saved him
with his last breath.

212
00:11:09,366 -> 00:11:13,558
And that poor child, had to drown
his dog, to stop their suffering.

213
00:11:14,705 -> 00:11:18,114
And all on the day of his birthday.

214
00:11:23,538 -> 00:11:29,276
Yes, I also want an apple pie,
y. .. chocolate cake banana split.

215
00:11:29,492 -> 00:11:29,900
Okay.

216
00:11:30,774 -> 00:11:33,084
Why not save me money
and you're screaming at your sister ...

217
00:11:33,084 -> 00:11:35,331
... Instead of off steam
with a couple of fries?

218
00:11:35,331 -> 00:11:36,446
Are you calling me fat?

219
00:11:36,792 -> 00:11:38,745
No, I'm calling you fat!

220
00:11:38,745 -> 00:11:39,945
Am I a liar?

221
00:11:40,229 -> 00:11:43,775
No. Are you giving back to all
what I mean? Why do that?

222
00:11:43,775 -> 00:11:45,383
Hurts my feelings!

223
00:11:46,210 -> 00:11:48,042
Can you speak on, please?

224
00:11:48,842 -> 00:11:49,350
Sorry.

225
00:11:49,716 -> 00:11:51,273
Why do you play both the hair?

226
00:11:51,769 -> 00:11:53,597
Therefore I do not touch the hair.

227
00:11:53,597 -> 00:11:55,581
Why everyone is
obsessed with my hair?

228
00:11:55,929 -> 00:11:56,479
I'm tired of it.

229
00:11:56,479 -> 00:11:57,804
Okay, okay. Relax.

230
00:11:57,804 -> 00:11:59,787
I do not want to talk about it.

231
00:12:03,262 -> 00:12:05,226
It's just that ... people laugh at me.

232
00:12:07,070 -> 00:12:08,677
I called head of a poodle.

233
00:12:10,427 -> 00:12:15,356
That is very cruel, it seems a bit ...
but still ...

234
00:12:17,888 -> 00:12:21,307
Listen to this Malcolm, sometimes
I'm so good I'm afraid.

235
00:12:21,307 -> 00:12:22,694
What are you doing with that toilet paper?

236
00:12:23,373 -> 00:12:27,650
I got some boxes of fruit, I changed
by the batteries batteries ... dvds ...

237
00:12:27,650 -> 00:12:31,672
... And that it changes the porter
supply of toilet paper in college.

238
00:12:32,775 -> 00:12:35,612
When my flesh take effect
seasoned with special wood ...

239
00:12:36,060 -> 00:12:37,063
... Will set the price you want.

240
00:12:37,063 -> 00:12:40,053
That you did not just evil.

241
00:12:40,053 -> 00:12:42,108
But you put effort and brain.

242
00:12:42,363 -> 00:12:43,709
I'm impressed.

243
00:12:43,709 -> 00:12:47,663
I do not know what it is. But when people
to suffer misfortune, leaving the best of me.

244
00:12:47,663 -> 00:12:49,169
Thank you.

245
00:12:49,169 -> 00:12:49,907
Hi Reese.

246
00:12:49,907 -> 00:12:51,850
Dadny Hi, Did you bring your impeller?

247
00:12:51,850 -> 00:12:52,543
Yes!

248
00:12:52,543 -> 00:12:53,514
Okay.

249
00:12:54,839 -> 00:12:56,570
Malcolm is not this cool?

250
00:12:56,570 -> 00:12:57,791
Not sure.

251
00:12:58,177 -> 00:13:02,068
Vamos! We may be in the gym
pelotasos not give us ...

252
00:13:02,380 -> 00:13:03,229
... Or we drop their pants.

253
00:13:03,229 -> 00:13:04,119
A dream come true.

254
00:13:04,119 -> 00:13:06,853
It really is possible
live in this school.

255
00:13:07,469 -> 00:13:08,559
Look at this.

256
00:13:10,536 -> 00:13:12,618
Are the keys to the locker room
girls.

257
00:13:12,618 -> 00:13:16,847
And we can be in place
bathe naked girls!

258
00:13:17,431 -> 00:13:18,852
So tell us!

259
00:13:18,852 -> 00:13:19,854
Malcolm!

260
00:13:20,082 -> 00:13:23,973
No visitors. Malcolm is punished
should not speak. All ...

261
00:13:23,973 -> 00:13:28,536
... This is my son, and is punished
nobody has to tell!

262
00:13:28,878 -> 00:13:31,176
Mom, please ... just came to say hi!

263
00:13:32,996 -> 00:13:34,626
I grabbed the keys
costumes for girls.

264
00:13:34,626 -> 00:13:35,814
Please do not tell
our mothers.

265
00:13:35,814 -> 00:13:37,015
I'm so ashamed.

266
00:13:47,476 -> 00:13:47,868
What?

267
00:13:48,087 -> 00:13:49,738
Did that just to humiliate me!

268
00:13:50,322 -> 00:13:50,926
Is that what you believe?

269
00:13:51,127 -> 00:13:51,571
Yes!

270
00:13:51,571 -> 00:13:53,149
You have no justification!

271
00:13:53,149 -> 00:13:55,598
And you know what?
I will never forget this!

272
00:13:56,204 -> 00:14:00,505
Well, is the first time that my punishment
in 10 years are recorded!

273
00:14:08,746 -> 00:14:12,187
People please, the money we raise
can not return to their parents ...

274
00:14:12,187 -> 00:14:15,809
... But we can do something for him.
Now we are their only family.

275
00:14:16,598 -> 00:14:18,686
Have not suffered enough for that train?

276
00:14:19,292 -> 00:14:24,526
A fact that would not be normal if
we look at the global level ...

277
00:14:24,844 -> 00:14:26,733
... Please give something to this child.

278
00:14:30,123 -> 00:14:32,596
I assure you it is very
hard to get 5 blankets.

279
00:14:32,989 -> 00:14:34,873
Look, I need, my family
is frozen.

280
00:14:35,214 -> 00:14:36,987
A lot of people are cold,
is a big problem.

281
00:14:37,938 -> 00:14:38,559
What about the clock?

282
00:14:39,083 -> 00:14:40,980
The one that came before you
gave his socks.

283
00:14:41,452 -> 00:14:43,808
It's a cold world.
It is becoming colder.

284
00:14:45,531 -> 00:14:47,918
You're a bloody and vicious brat.

285
00:14:50,669 -> 00:14:51,955
The socks also.

286
00:14:54,238 -> 00:14:57,411
One day I said they were studying
and were eating a snack.

287
00:14:57,411 -> 00:14:58,366
Do not tell me!

288
00:14:58,366 -> 00:15:01,019
They came to my room
napkins ask me!

289
00:15:01,286 -> 00:15:05,119
I could not tell that it hurt, I have
maintain my tough guy appearance.

290
00:15:05,476 -> 00:15:07,253
They have no idea how I really am.

291
00:15:07,253 -> 00:15:08,940
Do not know my dream journal.

292
00:15:08,940 -> 00:15:10,994
A day?
I think you're cool.

293
00:15:14,795 -> 00:15:15,735
Me too.

294
00:15:16,615 -> 00:15:19,747
But they do not tell them, if
knew I would look ridiculous.

295
00:15:19,747 -> 00:15:21,642
What is it? Ignore them.

296
00:15:22,472 -> 00:15:24,345
Do you ignore your sister?

297
00:15:24,889 -> 00:15:26,425
She is an idiot.

298
00:15:26,982 -> 00:15:28,268
Congratulations.

299
00:15:29,053 -> 00:15:31,990
Most I know are like that.

300
00:15:30,531 -> 00:15:33,114
At night I lock myself
spin my globe ..

301
00:15:33,114 -> 00:15:35,928
and I guess I'm living
my finger is pointing.

302
00:15:36,264 -> 00:15:37,787
I also do that!

303
00:15:38,263 -> 00:15:40,217
And feel cooler than anyone.

304
00:15:40,217 -> 00:15:43,981
Because let's face it ... ..
blood does not circulate well.

305
00:15:47,564 -> 00:15:49,279
And gave him money.

306
00:15:49,907 -> 00:15:52,185
I see, and apparently is
was very satisfied.

307
00:15:52,399 -> 00:15:55,116
We do not have
clothe and educate him!

308
00:15:56,042 -> 00:15:58,794
Put it to work in mines
as they did with you.

309
00:15:58,794 -> 00:16:00,189
But my income is not ...

310
00:16:00,189 -> 00:16:02,892
Want to take it with you to the grave?

311
00:16:02,892 -> 00:16:05,393
You want me to get a trunk?

312
00:16:07,620 -> 00:16:09,237
Give me my shoe!

313
00:16:09,237 -> 00:16:11,279
You are here, come get it.

314
00:16:11,636 -> 00:16:13,982
What, your mom punished?

315
00:16:16,824 -> 00:16:18,870
The bad boy wants to take his shoe.

316
00:16:19,715 -> 00:16:22,422
Malcolm, back to your bed.

317
00:16:22,422 -> 00:16:23,238
I've got my shoe.

318
00:16:23,527 -> 00:16:25,590
Go back to bed, I take care of this.

319
00:16:25,885 -> 00:16:29,120
Her mother will take care of this.

320
00:16:31,698 -> 00:16:33,886
Malcolm turns and to that bed.

321
00:16:36,947 -> 00:16:37,423
No.

322
00:16:38,854 -> 00:16:40,032
Excuse me?

323
00:16:40,402 -> 00:16:42,077
I tried, I quit.

324
00:16:42,077 -> 00:16:43,447
What do you mean by "quit"?

325
00:16:43,447 -> 00:16:46,826
I give up this system.
The only reason why you punish me like this ...

326
00:16:46,826 -> 00:16:49,307
... Is because I agree to be punished as well.

327
00:16:49,593 -> 00:16:51,501
And I will not accept it anymore.

328
00:16:51,813 -> 00:16:54,280
This is not maternity
is pure sadism!

329
00:16:54,280 -> 00:16:55,718
Do you think I enjoy this?

330
00:16:55,718 -> 00:16:56,750
Yes, I think so!

331
00:16:56,750 -> 00:16:58,067
And I'm too old.

332
00:16:58,552 -> 00:17:00,967
We need to find
other relationship, we go home ...

333
00:17:00,967 -> 00:17:02,780
... Let's change the rules.

334
00:17:03,413 -> 00:17:06,196
What do you plan to do?
"Take my tv when you married?

335
00:17:06,661 -> 00:17:08,741
"Locked up when you have 30 years?

336
00:17:11,065 -> 00:17:13,116
Well, what is supposed to be scared?

337
00:17:14,599 -> 00:17:16,198
What will you do now, hit me?

338
00:17:16,431 -> 00:17:17,074
Okay.

339
00:17:20,582 -> 00:17:21,972
Mom, what are you ....? hac

340
00:17:23,428 -> 00:17:24,860
Mom, calm down ...

341
00:17:25,157 -> 00:17:26,912
I do not know what you think you do but ...

342
00:17:27,113 -> 00:17:27,845
I think I've been through.

343
00:17:39,240 -> 00:17:42,501
When you can not do this,
will change the rules.

344
00:17:46,103 -> 00:17:49,881
Is it only $ 563?

345
00:17:49,881 -> 00:17:51,314
Come on, people!

346
00:17:51,937 -> 00:17:55,365
What if I need dentures,
what happens if you osteriosis?

347
00:17:58,392 -> 00:18:00,031
Well, okay ...

348
00:18:00,255 -> 00:18:05,600
Sorry little boy ... always
you get a job in a circus.

349
00:18:05,999 -> 00:18:10,280
While others conduct our
porsche and eat a good Salamin.

350
00:18:10,598 -> 00:18:13,390
Dad, I have a gut, let's go home.

351
00:18:13,390 -> 00:18:14,190
Not now son.

352
00:18:14,190 -> 00:18:15,609
Is that your son?

353
00:18:15,609 -> 00:18:16,757
Yes, why?

354
00:18:16,757 -> 00:18:20,780
This man has taken the
money for his own son!

355
00:18:20,780 -> 00:18:22,843
What?

356
00:18:22,843 -> 00:18:23,391
Dewey, did you tell these people that ...?

357
00:18:23,391 -> 00:18:24,908
What the hell are you doing sir?

358
00:18:24,908 -> 00:18:27,361
This has been shamelessly stolen!

359
00:18:27,361 -> 00:18:29,316
Wait, wait, wait ...

360
00:18:29,545 -> 00:18:31,119
I swear I did not know anything about it!

361
00:18:32,078 -> 00:18:33,455
And if he lied ... well ...

362
00:18:33,455 -> 00:18:36,454
... I assure you it is the type of
behavior that allow my family!

363
00:18:36,688 -> 00:18:38,170
Is your child?

364
00:18:39,386 -> 00:18:40,686
Has organized a black market.

365
00:18:41,221 -> 00:18:43,797
Diabetic has forced doshombres
smoking by insulin.

366
00:18:43,797 -> 00:18:45,454
Not true, Dad, is a liar.

367
00:18:48,708 -> 00:18:51,827
Wait, is that the discomfort
that caused this ...

368
00:18:51,827 -> 00:18:54,440
... But if I only get a moment I
say to fix this issue.

369
00:18:58,136 -> 00:19:00,654
Guys, your chamber
has been very bad!

370
00:19:01,133 -> 00:19:06,164
So I will apologize to those
people than ever have.

371
00:19:06,164 -> 00:19:07,007
Are you listening?

372
00:19:11,665 -> 00:19:12,111
Go ahead.

373
00:19:12,554 -> 00:19:13,838
Loud and clear.

374
00:19:14,488 -> 00:19:18,958
Sorry to have left the couch in the way
and have derailed the train.

375
00:19:25,588 -> 00:19:26,553
A run!

376
00:19:35,601 -> 00:19:36,820
Well, we arrived.

377
00:19:37,769 -> 00:19:39,815
Maybe one day you call.

378
00:19:39,815 -> 00:19:40,502
Anytime.

379
00:19:45,955 -> 00:19:48,533
Hey, I enjoyed it.

380
00:19:48,853 -> 00:19:49,736
Yeah, me too!

381
00:19:49,736 -> 00:19:51,908
You really are a good friend.

382
00:19:52,797 -> 00:19:53,113
Thanks.

383
00:19:58,552 -> 00:19:59,506
Sorry about tonight.

384
00:20:00,094 -> 00:20:05,219
Yes? Because you plan to torture me with a
12 year old girl failed. Had a great time.

385
00:20:05,688 -> 00:20:06,892
If, head of a poodle?

386
00:20:07,914 -> 00:20:10,497
You know what? I do not care
these useless sarcasm ...

387
00:20:10,999 -> 00:20:12,131
... You can call me anytime.

388
00:20:12,957 -> 00:20:14,548
I think I'll stick with,
"Head of a poodle"

389
00:20:14,548 -> 00:20:15,224
Okay.

390
00:20:17,796 -> 00:20:20,176
I'm glad you do not mind
call poodle head.

391
00:20:22,033 -> 00:20:22,755
But I would like ...

392
00:20:22,755 -> 00:20:23,535
Shut up!

393
00:20:24,830 -> 00:20:29,579
Do not put your feet off in this area.
Not think of stepping outside.

394
00:20:29,972 -> 00:20:31,302
I just want to stop
one thing clear ...

395
00:20:31,517 -> 00:20:33,890
When we go home you
still present ...

396
00:20:33,890 -> 00:20:35,798
... In the garden, right?

397
00:20:36,568 -> 00:20:40,207
If not I would take this uniform
personally it a shake.

398
00:20:40,207 -> 00:20:41,928
I see.

399
00:20:42,286 -> 00:20:45,240
Are you telling me I can not
punish my own child?

400
00:20:45,819 -> 00:20:47,753
Listen, there are many
people affected ...

401
00:20:47,753 -> 00:20:50,159
... It's better to stay here
with the rest of the rioters.

402
00:20:52,784 -> 00:20:54,974
We are told that we
within this square.

403
00:21:03,575 -> 00:21:04,605
This is outrageous!

404
00:21:06,616 -> 00:21:08,165
We'll freeze to death!

405
00:21:08,165 -> 00:21:09,147
What have we done?

406
00:21:09,349 -> 00:21:11,983
Maybe you can bring malcolm
some blankets, come on.

407
00:21:13,975 -> 00:21:16,621
Malcolm! Can you bring some blankets?

408
00:21:20,067 -> 00:21:22,597
Sorry. It is assumed that no
I leave my bed.

409
00:21:23,944 -> 00:21:27,044
Do not think you'll suffer the
consequences of this sir!
