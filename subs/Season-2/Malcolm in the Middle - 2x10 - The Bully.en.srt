1
00:00:15,500 -> 00:00:17,000
Hey guys, what do they do?

2
00:00:32,501 -> 00:00:34,001
Ojala be small forever.

3
00:00:36,002 -> 00:00:38,802
Malcolm 2x10 - The bully

4
00:00:39,002 -> 00:00:45,002
Subtitles made by matiasmab21
Enjoy them ^ ^

5
00:01:13,303 -> 00:01:15,503
Reese knows get people snot
Shock ...

6
00:01:15,804 -> 00:01:17,304
... And the truth is that winning a trophy for that!

7
00:01:17,605 -> 00:01:18,605
When it's up to Reese?

8
00:01:18,606 -> 00:01:19,606
I think it is as follows.

9
00:01:20,907 -> 00:01:22,007
GO REESE!

10
00:01:23,908 -> 00:01:25,008
Are the parents of Reese?

11
00:01:26,409 -> 00:01:27,009
Why?

12
00:01:27,010 -> 00:01:32,010
It's amazing! In the last competition
his fight was the best, he inspired the whole team.

13
00:01:33,811 -> 00:01:34,511
"Y. ..?

14
00:01:35,012 -> 00:01:36,812
Nothing ... It's great!

15
00:01:38,313 -> 00:01:39,813
Ences Gra ... ...

16
00:01:40,514 -> 00:01:43,314
Still do not get used to
be proud of Reese.

17
00:01:43,915 -> 00:01:45,315
Go team!

18
00:01:45,916 -> 00:01:47,016
Thanks, stupid.

19
00:01:48,917 -> 00:01:49,717
Where is Reese?

20
00:01:49,718 -> 00:01:51,018
Should not it be warmer?

21
00:01:53,119 -> 00:01:55,019
Reese! We're next!

22
00:02:00,020 -> 00:02:00,720
We Reese!

23
00:02:00,721 -> 00:02:01,921
Hurry

24
00:02:10,422 -> 00:02:11,922
That's not fair ...

25
00:02:12,523 -> 00:02:14,623
... Hope you stick to a pretty girl?

26
00:02:15,324 -> 00:02:17,624
I'm going to hit a girl ... great!

27
00:02:23,225 -> 00:02:24,025
We Reese!

28
00:02:32,626 -> 00:02:33,626
Two points.

29
00:02:44,727 -> 00:02:46,027
Two points.

30
00:02:53,028 -> 00:02:54,028
We Reese!

31
00:02:54,029 -> 00:02:55,029
Go son!

32
00:02:55,030 -> 00:02:56,530
Matala!

33
00:03:03,531 -> 00:03:04,831
Come on, referee!

34
00:03:04,832 -> 00:03:05,632
Let go warning.

35
00:03:05,633 -> 00:03:07,333
Go!

36
00:03:47,634 -> 00:03:49,334
"Reese is now a girl?

37
00:03:49,835 -> 00:03:51,335
No, Dewey, he is a lady.

38
00:03:51,336 -> 00:03:52,336
Shut up!

39
00:03:52,337 -> 00:03:53,337
Sorry lady.

40
00:03:53,338 -> 00:03:54,338
Well, that's enough.

41
00:03:54,939 -> 00:03:59,339
Reese lost a battle, there is no problem.
Sometimes you win and sometimes not.

42
00:03:59,340 -> 00:04:02,340
Yes, and you have no shame because, you worked.

43
00:04:02,841 -> 00:04:05,841
That girl was a better fighter than you without question ...

44
00:04:05,842 -> 00:04:09,042
... God made you fall on the platform as a rag!

45
00:04:14,143 -> 00:04:15,043
Hello?

46
00:04:14,944 -> 00:04:15,944
Hold him!

47
00:04:16,045 -> 00:04:17,545
You, afeitale ass!

48
00:04:17,546 -> 00:04:23,446
Mom, I remind you that today is the last day to buy me a ticket
plane to go home for my birthday ...!

49
00:04:23,447 -> 00:04:24,747
Honey, I talked about this ...

50
00:04:24,748 -> 00:04:27,748
... You can not come here in the middle of the week
'd just eight hours.

51
00:04:27,749 -> 00:04:28,749
But Mom ...!

52
00:04:28,750 -> 00:04:32,850
Heaven, I'm sorry. I wish things were different, and came
for Thanksgiving and we can not afford now.

53
00:04:32,951 -> 00:04:36,751
Mama, do not know what they do to people here
for his birthday ...!

54
00:04:36,752 -> 00:04:42,052
I removed the clothes, they shave all the hair on your body
and then thrown into the pond.

55
00:04:42,053 -> 00:04:43,553
Is that what you want for me?

56
00:04:43,554 -> 00:04:47,154
I am impressed Francis, your stories have improved
are at least more credible.

57
00:04:47,255 -> 00:04:48,455
What stories?

58
00:04:48,556 -> 00:04:53,056
When you wanted to come to the party and swore that
academy was being terrorized by wild dogs.

59
00:04:53,257 -> 00:04:54,757
Do you ever caught?

60
00:04:54,758 -> 00:04:59,458
Francis I also would like to have you home by your
birthday but we can not afford!

61
00:04:59,459 -> 00:05:05,159
Well, I guess I'll have to cope alone, I hope these monsters
not notice that my ... you know!

62
00:05:08,860 -> 00:05:10,660
It still remains an eyebrow him!

63
00:05:15,661 -> 00:05:18,861
Hey Malcolm, I know about your brother the other night.

64
00:05:18,862 -> 00:05:20,862
It was extremely fun Do not you see?

65
00:05:21,363 -> 00:05:23,763
A sports event ...?

66
00:05:23,764 -> 00:05:27,164
Yes .. I wonder how you feel being beaten by a girl.

67
00:05:27,165 -> 00:05:29,965
It's totally humiliating, you just want to kill.

68
00:05:30,366 -> 00:05:32,066
Your brother was not over, right?

69
00:05:33,667 -> 00:05:34,367
No. ..

70
00:05:34,368 -> 00:05:35,368
Me neither!

71
00:05:35,969 -> 00:05:40,669
You know, the shameful defeat of Reese may have
serious consequences for us ...

72
00:05:40,670 -> 00:05:43,670
... Will be stronger locking extra hard to prove
that is at the top.

73
00:05:43,871 -> 00:05:47,671
You mean we'd have to deal with a
Reese more evil than before?

74
00:05:47,672 -> 00:05:48,672
It is very probable.

75
00:05:49,173 -> 00:05:54,673
We can take the beating, but we should not use
underwear in case we split our ups and half.

76
00:05:55,874 -> 00:05:57,674
Here comes.

77
00:06:07,975 -> 00:06:10,675
This is the first time I'm glad to be me.

78
00:06:17,076 -> 00:06:18,776
Do not you have something else to look?

79
00:06:21,877 -> 00:06:23,777
I'll give you something to watch.

80
00:06:39,078 -> 00:06:42,878
Very good idea about the chocolate milk.
I will next time.

81
00:06:46,079 -> 00:06:48,679
Well, what the hell was that batter on the playground?

82
00:06:48,680 -> 00:06:50,380
I do not know, I had to do something!

83
00:06:50,981 -> 00:06:54,781
Echarte "milk over? Was not it better to hit
that child?

84
00:06:54,782 -> 00:06:56,282
Because I'm sick of doing that!

85
00:06:56,283 -> 00:06:57,983
I got sick of hitting children.

86
00:06:58,484 -> 00:06:59,484
It's horrible!

87
00:06:59,485 -> 00:07:01,285
But that's you, that's what you do.

88
00:07:01,286 -> 00:07:02,286
Not anymore.

89
00:07:02,487 -> 00:07:03,887
That's my old self.

90
00:07:03,888 -> 00:07:07,288
What I did today at school, I was destroying
the old Reese.

91
00:07:07,289 -> 00:07:10,989
So what of the chocolate was a
kind of baptism?

92
00:07:10,990 -> 00:07:14,590
No, idiot, I was cleaning out my old self for
start again!

93
00:07:14,591 -> 00:07:18,591
You know, you are very rare since that girl you
kicked ass.

94
00:07:18,592 -> 00:07:20,192
It is not just for the girl ...

95
00:07:20,793 -> 00:07:22,493
The fight made me feel good you know ...

96
00:07:23,194 -> 00:07:27,694
I was helping the school, people respected me and now
it was finished and I have nothing.

97
00:07:28,695 -> 00:07:30,495
But it will not be so anymore.

98
00:07:30,496 -> 00:07:32,996
I'll find a way for people
be proud of me again.

99
00:07:32,997 -> 00:07:34,397
So what are you doing?

100
00:07:34,398 -> 00:07:37,398
I do not know. Just want to be the good guy ...

101
00:07:37,999 -> 00:07:39,099
... Do good things ...

102
00:07:39,900 -> 00:07:40,900
... For good.

103
00:07:42,001 -> 00:07:43,301
Dewey, How I can help?

104
00:07:43,302 -> 00:07:44,102
Mamáaaaaaaaaaaa ....!

105
00:07:44,103 -> 00:07:46,303
Shut up, I'm trying to help!

106
00:07:49,604 -> 00:07:50,604
Hello my love.

107
00:07:52,305 -> 00:07:53,305
What happens?

108
00:07:54,306 -> 00:07:55,306
Is it Francis?

109
00:07:55,707 -> 00:07:56,507
If ...

110
00:07:57,208 -> 00:08:00,608
Has been calling lately and stupid
stories move me ...

111
00:08:00,809 -> 00:08:02,309
... The poor man just wants to come home.

112
00:08:02,610 -> 00:08:04,310
Want to be here on his birthday.

113
00:08:05,011 -> 00:08:08,011
Well maybe we could do something that night
not to think about that.

114
00:08:08,912 -> 00:08:12,012
A colleague got tickets
on the radio for a concert.

115
00:08:12,513 -> 00:08:13,413
"You're charging?

116
00:08:13,414 -> 00:08:15,514
He did not wanted! Can you believe it?

117
00:08:19,015 -> 00:08:19,615
Hello?

118
00:08:19,616 -> 00:08:22,216
Mom! It's great, I found a way to go
home on Wednesday.

119
00:08:22,217 -> 00:08:23,117
Francis ...

120
00:08:23,118 -> 00:08:24,718
No, not cost them anything.

121
00:08:24,719 -> 00:08:26,719
A parent of a cadet is a truck driver ...

122
00:08:26,720 -> 00:08:32,020
... Can you take it in the fridge to 609 and a friend
his pilot a plane fusilación ...

123
00:08:32,121 -> 00:08:35,721
... And if you are sober would leave me in the field of soybeans
next to the station.

124
00:08:35,722 -> 00:08:36,122
Honey.

125
00:08:36,123 -> 00:08:38,423
Francis, come on ... there will be other birthdays.

126
00:08:38,424 -> 00:08:40,324
Tell if you do not want a shirt to the concert.

127
00:08:41,625 -> 00:08:42,325
What concert?

128
00:08:43,426 -> 00:08:45,326
Your father got tickets to see
Jimmy Buffet.

129
00:08:45,427 -> 00:08:48,627
And this concert will not be a Wednesday night, right?

130
00:08:48,828 -> 00:08:49,828
"On my birthday?

131
00:08:50,029 -> 00:08:52,329
Yes, so it is but it has nothing to ...

132
00:08:52,330 -> 00:08:57,430
Now I understand ... can not afford to take me home
but somehow find the money for the entry of Jimmy Buffet.

133
00:08:57,431 -> 00:08:59,831
Francis, it is not. Tickets are free!

134
00:08:59,832 -> 00:09:00,632
Oh yeah ...

135
00:09:00,633 -> 00:09:02,233
A friend of your father gave to us.

136
00:09:02,234 -> 00:09:03,334
The truth is that there is a friend ...

137
00:09:04,335 -> 00:09:09,035
Agree on their stories before
try to keep me away in my ... Birthday!.

138
00:09:16,036 -> 00:09:16,736
Hey Malcolm!

139
00:09:16,737 -> 00:09:17,737
You want my cake?

140
00:09:17,738 -> 00:09:18,738
Are not you hungry?

141
00:09:18,739 -> 00:09:21,739
No, I ate the food they bring
as a decoy.

142
00:09:22,040 -> 00:09:24,840
Now that I no longer Reese robs me
are the two.

143
00:09:24,841 -> 00:09:28,841
And Reese has not made me eat garbage
in one week, the food tastes better!

144
00:09:28,942 -> 00:09:31,642
... Life is good!

145
00:09:32,643 -> 00:09:36,143
I take ballet classes, and I do not care that everyone knows.

146
00:09:36,444 -> 00:09:37,144
Well

147
00:09:39,545 -> 00:09:41,945
Two days ago, Reese would have killed that kid ...

148
00:09:41,946 -> 00:09:43,746
... Things are really changing.

149
00:09:43,847 -> 00:09:46,847
It is as if we had entered a civilized stage.
It's great!

150
00:09:48,948 -> 00:09:49,548
Hey.

151
00:09:49,949 -> 00:09:50,549
Hello!

152
00:09:51,750 -> 00:09:52,650
Why was that?

153
00:09:52,651 -> 00:09:55,251
That is very clever and laugh at me
all the time.

154
00:09:56,252 -> 00:09:59,352
As Reese and is not involved, I have it stand you more.

155
00:09:59,453 -> 00:10:00,653
What are you talking about?

156
00:10:00,654 -> 00:10:06,354
Now that your brother is a gallinam, I have no
worry that comes for me when I taught a lesson.

157
00:10:06,355 -> 00:10:07,355
But we're friends!

158
00:10:07,356 -> 00:10:10,356
You laughed when I painted my face and said it was a stupid ...

159
00:10:10,457 -> 00:10:12,057
... You call that friend?

160
00:10:12,058 -> 00:10:13,458
Those things were fun.

161
00:10:13,459 -> 00:10:18,459
Yes, very funny. I'll show you what's funny.
Knock Knock, Who's there?

162
00:10:19,860 -> 00:10:21,460
Just so you know.

163
00:10:23,261 -> 00:10:24,461
What about him?

164
00:10:26,062 -> 00:10:28,862
Remember me? "Moby Rick"

165
00:10:28,863 -> 00:10:30,563
That was sooo funny.

166
00:10:30,664 -> 00:10:34,064
I never called you Moby Rick, I called hippo y. ..

167
00:10:35,965 -> 00:10:37,765
Hey, just wait a minute!

168
00:10:40,566 -> 00:10:42,466
You really do not think I'm funny?

169
00:10:48,867 -> 00:10:51,467
Well, every day we learn something new.

170
00:10:54,168 -> 00:10:56,568
Obviously, it was not as fun as I thought.

171
00:10:58,069 -> 00:11:00,869
You know, your funny comments humiliated us enough.

172
00:11:00,870 -> 00:11:01,870
Siii!

173
00:11:01,871 -> 00:11:05,971
You know I'm unsure on my taste in clothes and
I always laughed at how I dressed.

174
00:11:05,972 -> 00:11:06,972
Siii!

175
00:11:06,973 -> 00:11:12,373
Always going around making you be smart and not
know that I slept all night crying.

176
00:11:12,374 -> 00:11:14,674
Ss ... Really?

177
00:11:15,675 -> 00:11:19,675
So the only reason I endured
those silly was because he feared for my brother?

178
00:11:21,676 -> 00:11:24,076
In reality we are also sick.

179
00:11:24,077 -> 00:11:26,177
These guys are crazy, I'm funny!

180
00:11:27,878 -> 00:11:29,578
Right, I'm funny?

181
00:11:29,579 -> 00:11:32,179
To be honest you something caustic.

182
00:11:32,580 -> 00:11:35,680
My word ... it's unbearable.

183
00:11:36,081 -> 00:11:38,881
How heavy, sarcastic, handsome?

184
00:11:40,682 -> 00:11:42,582
Hey, she's cute!

185
00:11:48,383 -> 00:11:49,583
Hi Jeffrey!

186
00:11:49,584 -> 00:11:51,584
Need help to cross the street?

187
00:11:52,585 -> 00:11:54,585
Do not worry, I'm good now.

188
00:11:57,886 -> 00:11:58,986
Jeffrey!

189
00:12:00,187 -> 00:12:03,487
How many times have I told you not to cross the road?!

190
00:12:04,488 -> 00:12:06,488
You'll see, you tell your mother Reese!

191
00:12:09,289 -> 00:12:09,989
Hello?

192
00:12:09,990 -> 00:12:10,990
Yes?

193
00:12:11,491 -> 00:12:12,791
I'm here to read.

194
00:12:12,792 -> 00:12:13,792
Okay.

195
00:12:15,293 -> 00:12:17,493
I was so happy when I said you were coming.

196
00:12:17,494 -> 00:12:18,994
Really? Great.

197
00:12:19,695 -> 00:12:20,595
I just want to help.

198
00:12:21,596 -> 00:12:24,596
They say that dying patients are encouraged with these things.

199
00:12:26,297 -> 00:12:29,197
Sorry. Di ... "said terminals?

200
00:12:35,998 -> 00:12:37,198
I was wrong room.

201
00:12:39,399 -> 00:12:40,399
And now that I think ...

202
00:12:40,600 -> 00:12:42,200
... I'm in the wrong hospital.

203
00:12:43,801 -> 00:12:46,501
Nurse ... enfermeraaa!

204
00:12:47,502 -> 00:12:49,502
Help, help, let me go!

205
00:12:49,503 -> 00:12:53,003
Happy Birthday Murphy!
We have been searching for hours!

206
00:12:53,004 -> 00:12:59,204
Please, please, my grandmother sent me
a gift, can stay, ayudaaaa!

207
00:12:59,205 -> 00:13:11,005
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU ... HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU ...
HAPPY BIRTHDAY DEAR MURPHY ...

208
00:13:11,006 -> 00:13:14,206
God! Be careful what you shave ...

209
00:13:14,507 -> 00:13:15,607
My God!

210
00:13:23,608 -> 00:13:26,008
I wish I could say that this is the stupidest thing
I've done ...

211
00:13:26,009 -> 00:13:29,209
... And to top it off I have to fix the window when I return.

212
00:13:29,210 -> 00:13:33,110
Do not be so hard on yourself. You have every
right to be worried ...

213
00:13:33,111 -> 00:13:36,111
I can not believe your parents let you
only on your birthday.

214
00:13:36,512 -> 00:13:37,912
Poor ...

215
00:13:39,613 -> 00:13:41,013
Well not that bad ...

216
00:13:41,014 -> 00:13:42,014
Yes it is.

217
00:13:42,015 -> 00:13:43,115
Yeah, I guess you're right.

218
00:13:44,116 -> 00:13:47,116
You know, this will be my first birthday
no cake.

219
00:13:47,217 -> 00:13:48,317
You know what?

220
00:13:49,018 -> 00:13:51,018
You're not going to spend your birthday alone ...

221
00:13:51,519 -> 00:13:54,019
Are you coming to my house and prepare you
a nice dinner.

222
00:13:54,320 -> 00:13:55,220
No. ..

223
00:13:55,721 -> 00:13:59,921
I do not want to bother you just because I have
hurt y. .. is just ...

224
00:14:00,622 -> 00:14:02,322
So I'll make a cake ... What flavor ...?

225
00:14:02,323 -> 00:14:03,323
I like chocolate!

226
00:14:05,824 -> 00:14:07,124
What happens?

227
00:14:07,525 -> 00:14:08,725
I do not know, Hal.

228
00:14:08,826 -> 00:14:11,126
I think it's all this about me Francis
is disturbing.

229
00:14:12,527 -> 00:14:13,527
Me too.

230
00:14:14,528 -> 00:14:17,528
You know what? Why not do something extra cool for him?

231
00:14:19,529 -> 00:14:20,529
What happened?

232
00:14:20,530 -> 00:14:21,530
What happened to me?

233
00:14:21,531 -> 00:14:22,831
I'll tell you what happened.

234
00:14:23,332 -> 00:14:26,432
From the girl that Reese has stopped being the bully
school ...

235
00:14:26,733 -> 00:14:32,433
... So now, no one is protecting me from people
who thinks I'm a smartass without grace, that is, for all.

236
00:14:33,334 -> 00:14:34,934
Well, you're a little sarcastic.

237
00:14:35,235 -> 00:14:36,735
Thanks Dad, I feel better.

238
00:14:36,736 -> 00:14:37,736
It's true.

239
00:14:40,337 -> 00:14:41,737
He's not funny!

240
00:14:43,638 -> 00:14:44,938
I'll go talk to him.

241
00:14:49,239 -> 00:14:50,439
A tough day eh ...

242
00:14:50,840 -> 00:14:51,740
If ...

243
00:14:52,541 -> 00:14:58,241
You know ... when people get angry with you
an apology can fix everything.

244
00:14:58,742 -> 00:14:59,942
Let me give a hypothetical example ...

245
00:15:00,243 -> 00:15:05,643
Suppose hypothetically that I tell a colleague that the head
dyes his hair ...

246
00:15:05,644 -> 00:15:10,444
... And let's say hypothetically that my partner
goes to my boss and told him what I said ...

247
00:15:11,345 -> 00:15:17,445
... And following hypothetically my boss sent me to the small
office at the end of the hallway next to the photocopier.

248
00:15:18,846 -> 00:15:23,446
... But if it would all be apologizing now
in an appropriate office.

249
00:15:24,347 -> 00:15:26,547
Or do you wish I be excused?

250
00:15:26,548 -> 00:15:28,048
In no way are stupid or what!

251
00:15:29,049 -> 00:15:32,249
Look, this scenario has not
to do with it.

252
00:15:32,250 -> 00:15:34,250
Just ... think about it.

253
00:15:36,751 -> 00:15:38,651
Well, I'll be there at eight o'clock.

254
00:15:39,052 -> 00:15:40,352
Yes, it feels much better.

255
00:15:40,953 -> 00:15:42,353
Okay, bye.

256
00:15:44,054 -> 00:15:45,354
I heard you got a hot date.

257
00:15:45,555 -> 00:15:46,955
No, just a nurse.

258
00:15:46,956 -> 00:15:48,456
With home ownership.

259
00:15:48,457 -> 00:15:49,257
Not too big.

260
00:15:49,258 -> 00:15:50,658
You are very lucky Francis.

261
00:15:51,059 -> 00:15:54,659
Flirt with girls, parents who have
I want ...

262
00:15:55,060 -> 00:15:56,260
What are you talking about?

263
00:16:00,661 -> 00:16:02,361
Hey, Who's birthday?

264
00:16:02,362 -> 00:16:04,262
According to the card you.

265
00:16:05,763 -> 00:16:09,063
Finally, my family sent me a gift ...
Eight months later.

266
00:16:10,264 -> 00:16:11,064
Which is ...

267
00:16:12,365 -> 00:16:18,765
... Ironic because my mom works in an office
Post, began in 1987, file ...

268
00:16:18,866 -> 00:16:20,866
Well, I put it here.

269
00:16:27,667 -> 00:16:28,267
Hello.

270
00:16:29,568 -> 00:16:30,468
What?

271
00:16:30,469 -> 00:16:31,569
I just want to talk.

272
00:16:32,470 -> 00:16:33,270
What?

273
00:16:33,271 -> 00:16:34,271
I just want to say I'm sorry.

274
00:16:34,472 -> 00:16:35,272
About what?

275
00:16:35,473 -> 00:16:40,173
Remember the day it was raining and said "Hey, it's raining"
and I said "Thanks Einstein"

276
00:16:40,174 -> 00:16:43,174
Yes, why did you say that? My name is not Einstein.

277
00:16:43,275 -> 00:16:47,675
I was referring to Albert Einstein was a physicist who was a genius.

278
00:16:47,676 -> 00:16:48,876
And you think I'm a genius?

279
00:16:50,477 -> 00:16:54,477
Heavens, I find a lot of jokes there ... but I have to change!

280
00:16:55,478 -> 00:16:59,378
No, I was being sarcastic, I was saying you were the opposite
a genius.

281
00:16:59,479 -> 00:17:01,979
So you were calling me stupid?

282
00:17:01,979 -> 00:17:04,379
Yes, and that is why I ...

283
00:17:13,480 -> 00:17:15,380
I'm glad we talked Malcolm.

284
00:17:15,981 -> 00:17:17,881
Yes, I also feel better.

285
00:17:18,382 -> 00:17:19,482
Malcolm Hey, come here!

286
00:17:21,883 -> 00:17:25,983
Finally I discovered, I found the answer, I know
what I do with my life.

287
00:17:25,984 -> 00:17:27,784
Do you sell these games yet?

288
00:17:27,785 -> 00:17:29,885
Yes, $ 5.

289
00:17:32,086 -> 00:17:33,086
What are you doing?

290
00:17:33,087 -> 00:17:34,587
Sell my possessions.

291
00:17:34,588 -> 00:17:35,588
Why?!

292
00:17:35,789 -> 00:17:37,489
Because Billy's brother recommended it to me.

293
00:17:37,490 -> 00:17:38,490
Is the brother Billy?

294
00:17:38,791 -> 00:17:42,491
You mean that crazy going on a school bus
leafleting?

295
00:17:42,492 -> 00:17:43,892
Called manifest.

296
00:17:44,293 -> 00:17:46,693
And it's no crazy when you think about it.

297
00:17:46,694 -> 00:17:50,694
He and his followers have an amazing house in Orehon
while living on earth.

298
00:17:51,195 -> 00:17:52,295
Do not you mean to him?

299
00:17:52,296 -> 00:17:53,996
Do not worry, it's totally safe.

300
00:17:53,997 -> 00:17:56,297
There are guard dogs, watchtowers ...

301
00:17:56,298 -> 00:17:57,298
Mom and Dad know about this?

302
00:17:57,299 -> 00:17:58,899
No, you can not tell.

303
00:17:59,100 -> 00:18:01,900
Billy's brother says they have power
negative and bad karma.

304
00:18:02,101 -> 00:18:04,001
You're talking about joining a cult!

305
00:18:04,002 -> 00:18:05,002
Are you crazy?

306
00:18:06,003 -> 00:18:09,703
Billy's brother never talks to me and makes me feel
good about myself.

307
00:18:09,804 -> 00:18:12,004
It's called brainwashing Reese.

308
00:18:12,005 -> 00:18:13,705
My name is not Reese.

309
00:18:14,306 -> 00:18:15,306
And what is it?

310
00:18:16,707 -> 00:18:18,407
I do not remember, but it's not Reese!

311
00:18:18,608 -> 00:18:21,308
Now if you'll excuse me, I have to distribute manifestos.

312
00:18:22,009 -> 00:18:22,909
Reese!

313
00:18:23,110 -> 00:18:24,310
You need help!

314
00:18:24,511 -> 00:18:25,211
What?

315
00:18:25,312 -> 00:18:28,012
As you stopped being the bully has created a power vacuum.

316
00:18:28,013 -> 00:18:33,013
Now the school is full of abusers
Good deal for spheres of influence.

317
00:18:33,014 -> 00:18:35,514
Today I took twice the money for food.

318
00:18:35,715 -> 00:18:41,115
Took it to me three times, and when I had nothing,
I pulled the shirt!

319
00:18:41,516 -> 00:18:42,516
They took my shoes!

320
00:18:43,017 -> 00:18:44,017
My shoes!

321
00:18:44,718 -> 00:18:45,818
What is supposed to I have to do that?

322
00:18:45,919 -> 00:18:47,019
We need you back.

323
00:18:47,620 -> 00:18:48,920
Why? He was an idiot!

324
00:18:49,021 -> 00:18:51,521
Yes, but were the dominant idiot!
