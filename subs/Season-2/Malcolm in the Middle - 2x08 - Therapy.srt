1
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:04,004
Did you get the eclairs?

2
00:00:04,045 --> 00:00:05,923
I did, but they
only had three left,

3
00:00:05,965 --> 00:00:09,009
and I had to cut in front
of an old woman to get those.

4
00:00:12,011 --> 00:00:14,348
Well, I just
won't have one.

5
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:16,183
No, no, no, no.
I won't have one.

6
00:00:16,224 --> 00:00:17,852
You and Dewey
can split one.

7
00:00:17,893 --> 00:00:19,979
That's not fair
to Dewey.

8
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:21,939
Forget it.

9
00:00:21,981 --> 00:00:24,149
We'll just let
the boys have them.

10
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:34,743
False alarm.

As near as I can figure,

24
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:13,365
my school was created
for the sole purpose

25
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:14,909
of making me miserable.

26
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:18,037
Today in Krelboyne class,
we start Medieval Week.

27
00:01:20,039 --> 00:01:21,122
Where's your
jester costume?

28
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:23,124
In my backpack.
I'll wear it at school.

29
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:24,626
Put it on.

30
00:01:24,668 --> 00:01:28,047
I didn't stay up all night
making it for my health.

31
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:35,512
Bells-- oh, I
forgot the bells.

32
00:01:35,554 --> 00:01:36,680
You look so adorable.

33
00:01:36,722 --> 00:01:38,473
You know what I love
about Medieval Week?

34
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:40,141
Is that you can spot
the Krelboynes

35
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:43,144
from super far away, and
they jingle when you hit them.

36
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:44,145
Reese.

37
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:46,648
Leave your brother alone.

38
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:49,109
Although you are asking for it.

39
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:52,112
Okay, ready?

40
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:53,697
Ready?

41
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:57,076
Come here.

42
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,661
Why don't you just put
a bull's-eye on my chest

43
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:00,829
and get it over with?

44
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:02,163
Oh, you look fine.

45
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:04,124
And Reese will tell me
if you take these off.

46
00:02:09,004 --> 00:02:12,173
When I was six, I dove in a pool
and my trunks came off.

47
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:14,175
God, I wish I was there
right now.

48
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:17,178
All right, children, it's time
to begin the harvest dance.

49
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:20,891
I'd demonstrate myself,
but being in my third trimester,

50
00:02:20,933 --> 00:02:22,183
I don't want to risk

51
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:25,646
the placenta separating
from my uterine wall.

52
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,148
Oh, come on.

53
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:29,316
We studied this.

54
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:32,193
There's nothing dirty
about the miracle of life.

55
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:34,738
And we should all be able
to discuss this openly.

56
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,197
Who's the father?

57
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,575
Does he... work here?

58
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:40,077
All right, you know, I told you

59
00:02:40,119 --> 00:02:43,080
we are not playing
this game again.

60
00:02:43,122 --> 00:02:45,874
All right, everyone, gather
their dance props, please.

61
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:48,376
Dabney, don't forget
you have a dentist appointment.

62
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:55,134
Okay.

63
00:02:55,174 --> 00:02:59,220
Your Holiness, would you start
the gay-- as in happy--

64
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:00,722
Harvest Procession?

65
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:04,726
Let's... kick it.

66
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:28,834
Dabney has three dentist
appointments every week.

67
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:30,293
His teeth look fine to me.

68
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:32,420
He's not going
to the dentist.

69
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:34,255
He's going to the "dentist."

70
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:37,217
It's a secret code
for the school therapist.

71
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:42,931
How come you know that?
You see the shrink, too?

72
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:44,725
Yes, I'm currently
seeing Ms. Gilbert.

73
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:46,518
My mother and stepfather
suggested it

74
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,062
as a preemptive strike

75
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:49,938
against my anger
displacement tendencies.

76
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:53,441
But ultimately,
therapy was my decision.

77
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:56,778
Not theirs... mine.

78
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,280
It was voluntary.

79
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:00,281
Okay.

80
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:01,282
Yes, I am!

81
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:04,244
My fear of rejection
is virtually gone,

82
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:07,414
and my self-worth is
at an all-time high.

83
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,836
I really think you're going to
like laundry duty, Francis.

84
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:16,548
Basically, you wash it,
you dry it, you fold it.

85
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,550
You want me to go
through that again?

86
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:19,885
No, twice was good.

87
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:22,179
Actually, I don't mind
doing laundry.

88
00:04:22,221 --> 00:04:24,181
Mom always thought
she was punishing me,

89
00:04:24,223 --> 00:04:27,768
but I always
found it relaxing.

90
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,310
Geez, this detergent is awful.

91
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:32,355
This is way too coarse
for our cotton blends.

92
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:33,690
Wasn't this stuff banned?

93
00:04:33,732 --> 00:04:35,316
Yeah, this is what we use.

94
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:38,361
You see, there is an arrangement
with the distributor.

95
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:40,321
We take this crappy
soap off his hands,

96
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:43,242
and, uh, he makes it
worth our while.

97
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,827
The Alabama Opera?

98
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:47,370
There's plenty more
where that came from.

99
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:48,622
No thanks.

100
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:50,415
Opera's not your thing.

101
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:51,875
That's fine.

102
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:53,794
This guy's got connections.

103
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:56,880
Cords of firewood,
tractor show,

104
00:04:56,922 --> 00:04:58,632
free burgers from Churchill's
when you buy a burger

105
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:00,259
of equal or greater value.

106
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,343
Don't you think
Marlin Academy is hard enough

107
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:04,054
without our own guys
selling us out?

108
00:05:04,096 --> 00:05:05,346
I mean, look at these.

109
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:07,474
You ever heard
of fabric softener?

110
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:08,600
These sheets are like

111
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:10,102
sleeping on straw.

112
00:05:10,144 --> 00:05:12,437
Hey, it was good enough
for the baby Jesus.

113
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,148
Get out.

114
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:23,740
Where are my cooling racks?

115
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:25,366
I know I put them in here.
What a mess!

116
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:26,409
Honey, please.

117
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:27,619
I'll go to the store,

118
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:28,662
and I'll buy you
new cooling racks.

119
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,080
No! I want to find these.

120
00:05:30,122 --> 00:05:31,915
And when I do, we are
all going to clean out

121
00:05:31,957 --> 00:05:33,374
this disaster of a closet.

122
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,127
It's going to be our
new family project.

123
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:37,171
We never finished our
last family project.

124
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:39,464
Because it's in here,
under two tons of crap.

125
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:45,887
Your dentist appointment, Lloyd?

126
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:47,848
My teeth feel fine today,
Caroline.

127
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,891
I like myself.

128
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:54,188
Oh, who am I kidding?

129
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:56,397
Great news!

130
00:05:56,439 --> 00:06:00,527
We have been granted permission
to perform the harvest dance

131
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:02,403
at the all-school
assembly today.

132
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:06,449
And fruit will be handed out
to the student body

133
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:08,243
in case they want to join in.

134
00:06:10,162 --> 00:06:11,538
Okay, everyone get
in their circles,

135
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:12,873
and...

136
00:06:22,216 --> 00:06:24,343
Sorry! Damn!

137
00:06:24,383 --> 00:06:25,552
Stupid!

138
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:26,803
I can't do it!

139
00:06:26,845 --> 00:06:28,596
I'm stupid and I'm terrible!

140
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,682
I suck at everything!

141
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:32,893
And I'm fat!

142
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,734
Okay, you just get comfortable.

143
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:42,027
We'll talk when you're ready.

144
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:43,111
Thank you, Ms. Gilbert.

145
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:44,988
Okay, so I faked it.

146
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:46,447
But with the
family I have,

147
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:49,368
it would've only been a
matter of time anyway.

148
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:02,381
We should probably
talk a little now.
Do we have to?

149
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:05,092
Well, that's sort of
why you're here.

150
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:08,469
That sucked! Where'd that
flamethrower come from?

151
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:09,221
Malcolm,

152
00:07:09,263 --> 00:07:11,348
I want you to feel relaxed here.

153
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:13,934
Now, school's really stressful
and can be pretty demanding.

154
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:15,394
This could be...

155
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,979
this could be a safe place
for you to unwind.

156
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:21,191
Not the face! Not the face!

157
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:26,280
Could I... unwind...
four or five times a week?

158
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:28,573
Maybe. What would
we talk about?

159
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:30,158
I don't know
where to begin.

160
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,160
I really don't.

161
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:34,621
Well, that was quite an episode
you had in class.

162
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:36,456
Did you want to talk
about that?

163
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:37,374
No.

164
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:38,875
You'll just think it's stupid.

165
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:42,503
Nothing you ever say in here
will be stupid.

166
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:44,798
But all I ever do
is make mistakes.

167
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:49,261
I feel like I don't even deserve
to beat my own high score.

168
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:51,512
Oh, yes, you do, Malcolm.

169
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:52,806
Thank you so much.

170
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:55,058
The tricky part is,
I need to keep this up

171
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,227
without being put
on medication.

172
00:07:58,061 --> 00:08:01,022
Underpants!
In a closet!

173
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:03,066
Human underpants!

174
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:05,526
I must not
threaten you people enough!

175
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:07,404
Oh, my Lord.

176
00:08:07,446 --> 00:08:08,780
Skittles!

177
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:14,119
You've been missing
for years.

178
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:15,578
You missed a
great assembly.

179
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,080
I can't believe it.

180
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:19,582
They actually gave us fruit
to throw at the Krelboynes.

181
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:21,542
What were they thinking?

182
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:24,129
Don't you ever get tired
of making their lives miserable?

183
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:26,840
Nope. Besides, I want them
to remember who's boss.

184
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:29,343
When they're living
in their mansions

185
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:30,593
with their
supermodel wives,

186
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:32,012
they're going to know--

187
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:34,555
the guy cleaning their pool
kicked their ass.

188
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:35,556
Hey.

189
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:37,600
I had six tomatoes
with your name on them.

190
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:39,019
Where were you?

191
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,146
None of your business.

192
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:42,439
Maybe it's Mom's business.

193
00:08:42,481 --> 00:08:43,815
I ditched to go
to the arcade.

194
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:44,732
Don't tell Mom.

195
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:45,900
The arcade's closed.

196
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:48,111
Not the one at the mall.

197
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:49,654
Wait a minute...

198
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:54,493
I  can  smell
my own breath.

199
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,580
You throw the ball
around the post;

200
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:03,584
it swings back and knocks
down the pins, okay?

201
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:04,961
I was good.

202
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:06,546
I was real good.

203
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:08,048
All right, now,
don't be upset

204
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:12,511
if the first time you
throw it, nothing hap...

205
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:13,636
Wow!

206
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,972
That was...
that was a flopper!

207
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:18,599
Ooh, man! Oh, man!

208
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:20,643
That was, that was
a lucky shot, okay?

209
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:22,562
Now, the real key

210
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:25,648
to Skittles is the
release point, all right?

211
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,150
When you release
the ball,

212
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:31,696
make sure that it goes
through on a parallel...

213
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:34,282
I can't believe it!

214
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:36,076
This collar's so crisp,
yet it doesn't chafe.

215
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:37,536
And these sheets...

216
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,079
it's like sleeping
on a cloud.

217
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,872
My pleasure, guys.

218
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:42,416
Dude...

219
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:43,166
thank you.

220
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:44,292
I've been hoping
for months

221
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:46,086
that my rash was
from the laundry.

222
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:47,421
Turns out it was.

223
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:48,171
Thanks.

224
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:49,630
Glad I could help.

225
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,174
Here, this is for you.

226
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:52,551
No, Joe, you don't have to.

227
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:53,552
I insist.

228
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:54,635
Wow.

229
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:56,263
Well, that was nice of you.

230
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:00,725
Hey, would you mind tossing in
some of my civilian stuff

231
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:02,602
with the academy rags?

232
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:05,146
Oh, I'd love to, but I'm
really swamped down here.

233
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:06,565
Well, yeah, whatever.

234
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,608
Guess I could find some time
for your stuff.

235
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:12,404
Hey... thanks, man.

236
00:10:13,572 --> 00:10:14,655
No, no, no, you don't have to...

237
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:15,615
You're the best.

238
00:10:28,462 --> 00:10:29,796
Go.

239
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:32,632
Ha-cha!

240
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:35,843
Garbage! In a closet!

241
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,845
Coffee grounds? Hal!

242
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:39,680
Lois, you've
got to see this.

243
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:41,558
The boy's a prodigy. Go.

244
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,767
Yes.

245
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:44,478
Who are the Petersons?

246
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:45,812
Why do we have
their photo albums?

247
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:46,729
Here we go.

248
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:48,689
Now.

249
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:51,067
Amazing!

250
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:52,735
Hi, Malcolm.
How was school?

251
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:54,779
It was normal.

252
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:56,239
Yeah, I'd say normal.

253
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:57,740
Very medieval.

254
00:10:57,782 --> 00:10:59,826
Is that a truck tire?

255
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:00,827
What?!

256
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:03,622
Oh, my G... Hal!

257
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,836
♪ ♪

258
00:11:35,654 --> 00:11:37,531
Um, Malcolm...

259
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:40,741
I wanted you to know
how proud I am of you.

260
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:43,286
Admitting you needed help
is the hardest step.

261
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:44,204
No, keeping up with all

262
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:46,289
the new cognitive
and behavioral therapies

263
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:48,249
is the hardest step, Lloyd.

264
00:11:50,168 --> 00:11:52,462
My self-worth is
still skyrocketing.

265
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,551
Okay, everybody...

266
00:11:57,592 --> 00:11:59,260
tomorrow's looming
demonstration

267
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:01,221
has been canceled.

268
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:03,557
Instead, we will be going
to see a reenactment

269
00:12:03,598 --> 00:12:05,266
of the slaughter
of French troops

270
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:06,476
at Azincourt

271
00:12:06,518 --> 00:12:09,229
followed by a visit to
the Museum of Torture...

272
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,104
and then pizza.

273
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:11,231
Museum of Torture?

274
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:12,815
That's awesome.

275
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:14,442
Do they have a gift shop?

276
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:16,528
I'm sorry, Malcolm.
You can't go.

277
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:18,530
You've a dentist
appointment.

278
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:20,323
You're lucky
you're not going.

279
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:21,866
My brother
went last year,

280
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:24,035
and there was so
much fake blood

281
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:26,538
that he fainted.

282
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:29,790
I think it's time I had
a major breakthrough in therapy.

283
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:32,669
Then a butterfly landed
on my wrist and I woke up.

284
00:12:32,711 --> 00:12:34,546
What color was that butterfly?

285
00:12:34,588 --> 00:12:37,965
It was either blue or purple.

286
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:39,384
Definitely not red or orange.

287
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:40,594
That I can remember.

288
00:12:40,635 --> 00:12:43,346
Your dream, Malcolm, is so...

289
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:45,306
so tranquil and soothing.

290
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:46,933
This is, this is encouraging.

291
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:48,268
Yeah?
Mm-hmm.

292
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:49,477
Yep, you're starting to relax.

293
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,104
I think I might be, too.

294
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:52,855
I need to seem cured,

295
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:54,815
but to leave the door open
for a relapse

296
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:56,775
when we start ballet
next semester.

297
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:58,819
I know I'll have
my ups and downs,

298
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:01,573
but right now
it feels good to be happy.

299
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:03,199
Well, I'm glad to hear it,

300
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:05,868
and I think we've made
a lot of progress.

301
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,995
Thanks, Ms. Gilbert.

302
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:12,208
I like myself now.

303
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,793
And I know I couldn't have
said that on Tuesday.

304
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:20,967
What are you doing here?

305
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:21,968
I figured out your scam.

306
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:23,094
It turns out

307
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:24,929
crazy runs in the family.
Reese...

308
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:26,765
you don't know
what you're doing.

309
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:28,516
You're going to ruin everything.

310
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:30,518
Relax. I've got it covered.

311
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,729
I'm ready to see you
now, Reese.

312
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:35,148
Reese isn't here right now.

313
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:37,816
This is Davey.

314
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:48,869
That's ten in a row.

315
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:50,747
Oh, Lois, he's got the gift.

316
00:13:50,789 --> 00:13:52,540
Since the end
of the big war,

317
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:55,418
there's only been one documented
triple consecutive flopper

318
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,753
in English
Alley Skittles.

319
00:13:56,795 --> 00:13:57,836
You know what
this means?

320
00:13:57,878 --> 00:13:59,880
I finally have
something to rub in the face

321
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:02,676
of that blowhard Higgins
and his little tennis champion.

322
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:04,135
What are you
talking about?

323
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:06,262
Oh, he's constantly
harping about his kid

324
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:07,555
winning this tournament,

325
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:08,931
winning that tournament.

326
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:10,224
Going to the White House.

327
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:11,559
I'm taking Dewey
over there

328
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:13,186
to shut that guy up
once and for all.

329
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:14,895
Hey, you ready to
shut that guy up

330
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:15,938
once and for all, son?

331
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,607
What guy?
He's ready.

332
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:18,899
Hal, you're
just doing this

333
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:20,943
to get out of
cleaning out that closet.

334
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:22,069
Not entirely.

335
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:23,822
Let's go, son.

336
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:26,907
What happened?

337
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:27,908
Did you get caught?

338
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:28,785
Where were you?

339
00:14:28,827 --> 00:14:30,370
Geez.
You're always so angry.

340
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:31,912
Maybe you really do
need therapy.

341
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:34,915
What I  need  is for you
not to ruin everything for me.

342
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:38,044
Do you know how much trouble
we'll be in if we get caught?

343
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:39,462
With Mom? With the school?

344
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:40,463
With  Mom?

345
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:42,215
Give me a little credit, psycho.

346
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:43,924
I've been doing my own research.

347
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:46,386
See, I rented
Silence of the Lambs,

348
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:48,805
Seven,  and  The Nutty Professor.

349
00:14:48,847 --> 00:14:49,972
Oh, God.

350
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:52,099
Reese, tell me
exactly what you told her.

351
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:53,934
Nope. That's confidential.

352
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,269
Now, which one
do you like more?

353
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:58,272
Hannibal Lecter
or the hockey mask?

354
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:04,738
Malcolm, Reese.

355
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:07,824
What do you have
to say for yourselves?

356
00:15:07,866 --> 00:15:10,993
Don't blame Reese.
Blame Davey.

357
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:12,704
Ow! Ow, ow.

358
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:13,872
Ow!

359
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:22,463
I'm sorry it's last minute,
but I need these tonight.

360
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:24,841
I got another date with Rebecca.

361
00:15:24,883 --> 00:15:27,719
Okay...

362
00:15:27,761 --> 00:15:30,847
Seven items... 30 bucks.

363
00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:33,140
I don't have that kind of money.

364
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:34,726
Last time it cost ten.

365
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:36,977
You can cut me some slack,
can't you?

366
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:39,647
I'd love to do you
a solid, Eric, but I'm booked,

367
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:41,982
and it would be unethical
to play favorites.

368
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,651
You can't do this to me.

369
00:15:43,693 --> 00:15:45,779
I need to wear my bowling shirt.

370
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:48,865
Rebecca loves
my bowling shirt.

371
00:15:48,907 --> 00:15:50,991
Francis, I don't have the money.

372
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:53,369
Well, then,
you don't have the clothes.

373
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:55,037
Got to pay to be a player.

374
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,373
Look at yourself.

375
00:15:57,415 --> 00:16:01,335
I remember the Francis
who cared about his job.

376
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:04,130
A cap and a half
of fabric softener, Francis.

377
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:06,382
Remember that?

378
00:16:06,424 --> 00:16:08,885
A cap and a half!

379
00:16:08,927 --> 00:16:12,012
If you'll excuse me, I
have some ironing to do.

380
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:17,351
I can't believe him.

381
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:19,562
Yeah. I had
to give him three CDs

382
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:22,022
just to get
my dress blues pressed.

383
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:25,192
I think it's time somebody
taught that guy a lesson.

384
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:27,487
Yeah.

385
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:30,156
We'll make him wear
a lame T-shirt.

386
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:34,160
Or we could put it
in a load of whites.

387
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:35,662
Just follow me.

388
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,960
So, my children
are emotionally disturbed?

389
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,378
Oh, we don't like
to use those labels.

390
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,506
I spent a whole week
with Malcolm.

391
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:49,008
Really? A whole week.

392
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:50,510
Yes, and, uh...

393
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:52,762
to be honest, I think,
I think there are

394
00:16:52,804 --> 00:16:54,221
some, uh, definite issues

395
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:56,808
that you and he
need to talk about.

396
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,309
Malcolm, you want to share

397
00:16:58,351 --> 00:16:59,978
this drawing
with your mother?

398
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,061
No, that's okay.

399
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:08,194
I like what you've
done with my teeth.

400
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:09,320
There are
some things

401
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:10,738
that Malcolm told me

402
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,114
that I think
you should hear.

403
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:15,075
Oh, well, I'd love
to hear them.

404
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,122
Go ahead, Malcolm.

405
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:21,248
Yeah, go ahead.

406
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:27,171
Everybody
wants to help.

407
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:28,798
You're safe here.

408
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:36,055
About the
anger thing?

409
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:37,348
Yeah.

410
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:40,059
Tell me about the anger thing.

411
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:44,480
When you're angry,

412
00:17:44,522 --> 00:17:46,399
you bottle up your feelings

413
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,068
and you freeze me out
with silence.

414
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:55,366
Well, I will, uh...
I'll  try  to be more vocal.

415
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:56,910
Go on.

416
00:17:56,951 --> 00:17:57,827
Please.

417
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:03,123
I wish you would spend
more time at home

418
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:05,125
and less time at the...

419
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:06,586
the racetrack.

420
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:10,631
Well, I guess I'm going
to have to change that, too.

421
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:12,675
Come on, Malcolm.

422
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:15,595
Tell her about
the pressure.

423
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:17,430
Well...

424
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,139
I feel you put a lot
of pressure on me,

425
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:21,141
and I can't live up
to your expectations.

426
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:22,268
What pressure?

427
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:23,519
Maybe not. I don't know.

428
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:25,145
No, no, no. Go back.
What were you saying?

429
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:28,441
Well, you put a lot
of pressure on me, and stuff.

430
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:30,401
What do you mean?
When do I pressure you?

431
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:31,485
All the time!

432
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,153
If it's not
the extra-credit reports,

433
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:35,281
it's all the advanced classes
you sign me up for,

434
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:36,657
and after that, I have

435
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:38,534
to help Reese and Dewey
with their homework.

436
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:40,160
That's not pressure.

437
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:41,871
You know,
I didn't ask to be born smart.

438
00:18:41,913 --> 00:18:44,040
We just want you to live up
to your potential.

439
00:18:44,082 --> 00:18:46,667
That.  That's exactly
what I'm talking about.

440
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:48,168
I tried to stop him.

441
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,713
I said, "Hey, don't put
that red T-shirt in there.

442
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:52,172
That's not colorfast."

443
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:53,340
But he just laughed.

444
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:55,093
He said pink was a better color

445
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,887
'cause that's what
"little, weak girls wear."

446
00:18:57,929 --> 00:18:59,430
We've looked everywhere else.

447
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:01,057
He's in here somewhere.

448
00:19:01,099 --> 00:19:02,683
Shh, shh!

449
00:19:16,114 --> 00:19:18,157
Francis?

450
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:21,368
No.

451
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:22,536
It's okay, Dewey.

452
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:24,330
Even the best of them
have off-days.

453
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:25,665
Uh-huh.

454
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:26,916
16 misses in a row.

455
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:30,252
Some people might think
you did it on purpose.

456
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:31,462
Huh.

457
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:33,965
Hey...

458
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:36,884
There something
you want to tell me, son?

459
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:38,719
I don't want to do this anymore.

460
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:40,179
It's boring.

461
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,931
You'd be giving up

462
00:19:41,973 --> 00:19:45,225
what might very well be
your one true talent.

463
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:49,147
You could be
another Chap Sanders, hmm?

464
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:53,818
Son, are you willing to turn
your back on your destiny?

465
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,695
Yeah. Can I go now?

466
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:57,237
All right,
if that's what you want.

467
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:58,739
Wait.

468
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:02,368
Can you throw it
for me one more time? Hmm?

469
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:05,245
One last flopper
for your old dad?

470
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:06,413
No.

471
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:11,044
All right, then.

472
00:20:11,085 --> 00:20:12,294
I'm sorry.

473
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:13,504
Oh, no, don't be.

474
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:15,381
I'm the one
who should apologize.

475
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:18,509
No, you guys just want
what's best for me. I know that.

476
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:20,260
Oh, we do. We love you.

477
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:21,846
I love you, too.

478
00:20:27,101 --> 00:20:28,019
Mom?

479
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:29,269
You really pissed me off

480
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,855
when you took away
my hockey stick

481
00:20:30,897 --> 00:20:32,606
'cause I was hitting
Dewey with it.

482
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:35,193
I know you're sorry.

483
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:38,237
I'll go in the attic
and take it down later.

484
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:44,785
Another Peterson box.

485
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:49,165
Ooh. This is
from the '60s.

486
00:20:49,207 --> 00:20:51,291
Huh. I forgot LBJ had
his gall bladder out.

487
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:52,668
I don't understand.

488
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:55,295
Didn't we clean out this
closet when we moved in?

489
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:56,422
Apparently not.

490
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:59,466
Oh, for crying out loud.

491
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:01,260
They left an
old toilet.

492
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:17,110
This is a bathroom.

493
00:21:17,151 --> 00:21:19,653
We have a second bathroom!

494
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:21,239
Shh.

495
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:26,368
If we don't tell them,
they won't know.

496
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:29,997
It'll just be
our little secret.

497
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:31,791
Our beautiful little secret.

498
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:36,420
Here.

499
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:37,880
Yeah.
