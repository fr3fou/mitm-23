1
00:00:10,046 -> 00:00:10,921
Hal!

2
00:00:15,919 -> 00:00:16,807
Are you smoking again?

3
00:00:17,276 -> 00:00:20,158
No! I'm cleaning, "Do you smell smoke?

4
00:00:20,466 -> 00:00:21,187
No, but I ...

5
00:00:21,187 -> 00:00:25,890
Lois if she wanted a cigarette would not be hiding like a scared teenager.

6
00:00:26,408 -> 00:00:28,576
What would the world view as a man.

7
00:00:34,669 -> 00:00:37,799
It was our third vacuum and
is our last cleaner.

8
00:01:13,090 -> 00:01:17,756
Francis did not want to hear any more argument!
You're going to fix the roof!

9
00:01:18,229 -> 00:01:22,061
It is totally unfair, I come home from school
and I immediately assign tasks.

10
00:01:22,061 -> 00:01:25,302
Well, someone has to,
you know your father was terrified of heights.

11
00:01:25,302 -> 00:01:26,729
Do not panic!

12
00:01:27,098 -> 00:01:30,022
The last time we had change a light bulb to guide him to lower the table.

13
00:01:30,521 -> 00:01:32,055
You're going to do this!

14
00:01:32,380 -> 00:01:35,613
Why not put me in the neck chain
and make me sleep in the garage?!

15
00:01:38,977 -> 00:01:40,837
This is what we call anger level 4

16
00:01:41,309 -> 00:01:45,723
The only way not to be challenged is to avoid
sudden movement and eye contact at all costs.

17
00:01:52,419 -> 00:01:57,009
And you think !...¿ hide the note, the board
Parents and teachers will be canceled?

18
00:01:57,462 -> 00:01:59,509
Mom, the teacher Woodward is against me

19
00:01:59,509 -> 00:02:01,756
All your teachers from kindergarten
have been against you.

20
00:02:02,044 -> 00:02:03,289
Yes, I know. It also bothers me.

21
00:02:28,335 -> 00:02:29,694
Why is clogged drain?

22
00:02:34,385 -> 00:02:39,759
Ah, well .. that .. is .. it was a crocodile ..
... Was about to do .. but .. very funny ...

23
00:02:40,037 -> 00:02:43,442
but, look at that mess is here ..
There is a spot of milk on the table ..

24
00:02:48,006 -> 00:02:50,760
Reese is still looking for a true academic

25
00:02:55,615 -> 00:03:02,571
Your attention is fluctuating, the initiative will
declining and that prevents potential reaches the maximum.

26
00:03:04,731 -> 00:03:05,427
What?

27
00:03:05,848 -> 00:03:09,239
In other words, Reese is not self-conscious.

28
00:03:09,854 -> 00:03:14,488
Hey, better I give you a topic
says "good or bad." That will help us better.

29
00:03:15,926 -> 00:03:18,174
Reese is failing on almost all subjects

30
00:03:18,743 -> 00:03:22,614
From what I've decided to recommend that
transferred into the class of slow learners

31
00:03:23,083 -> 00:03:24,239
And that's a metaphor ...

32
00:03:24,693 -> 00:03:25,933
... Kind of slow learners ...

33
00:03:28,228 -> 00:03:29,994
! Nooooo!

34
00:03:30,418 -> 00:03:32,083
No, no, no, no ...

35
00:03:32,536 -> 00:03:34,333
No, no ... this is not an option.

36
00:03:34,333 -> 00:03:35,400
We who strive

37
00:03:35,789 -> 00:03:36,613
I wish it were that easy.

38
00:03:36,613 -> 00:03:39,244
Reese will be updated,
will even kill him.

39
00:03:39,915 -> 00:03:44,458
I'm glad your level of commitment.
I'm really happy to have this conversation.

40
00:03:45,854 -> 00:03:46,823
Then we can go now.

41
00:03:48,503 -> 00:03:53,253
I do not want to hear any excuses, you sit all night and work up to raise scores.

42
00:03:53,459 -> 00:03:54,824
Why do I have to teach me?

43
00:03:55,183 -> 00:03:57,603
Because God gave you a brain big, Blame him.

44
00:03:57,603 -> 00:04:00,650
"Reese failed and to torment me?
What is the logic in that?

45
00:04:00,941 -> 00:04:03,429
Malcolm I have 0 tolerance for this

46
00:04:03,723 -> 00:04:06,347
Mom finally found his courage to express his thoughts.

47
00:04:06,821 -> 00:04:08,832
Why do not you fix that roof?

48
00:04:09,037 -> 00:04:12,086
We are 5 degrees I'll freeze and it will rain.

49
00:04:12,341 -> 00:04:13,865
Therefore you need to shave that roof

50
00:04:14,163 -> 00:04:17,366
Maybe if not buy as cheap tiles would not leak all the time.

51
00:04:17,614 -> 00:04:21,039
Francis while in this house
will do everything I say.

52
00:04:21,411 -> 00:04:26,582
You know what Mom? No!
'm Too big to be handled for you.

53
00:04:27,193 -> 00:04:31,098
Our whole life all you've done is make
what you want.

54
00:04:31,587 -> 00:04:37,268
You're the boss of the world and we're tired.
This may be your roof but also live here.

55
00:04:37,268 -> 00:04:41,413
We are human beings with rights and therefore
I put an end to your reign of terror.

56
00:04:42,337 -> 00:04:44,568
You should see the look on his face but it worked completely.

57
00:04:45,066 -> 00:04:47,175
Sounds like you went wrong

58
00:04:47,879 -> 00:04:48,820
Friend, you have no idea.

59
00:04:51,693 -> 00:04:52,207
Thanks

60
00:04:52,849 -> 00:04:54,757
I have a shelter near the bus station.

61
00:04:55,379 -> 00:05:01,996
And it is warm and fairly dry.
You can stay there for a while, if that want.

62
00:05:02,723 -> 00:05:03,519
Would you do that for me?

63
00:05:03,963 -> 00:05:07,628
It's a tough world, we have to guard us.

64
00:05:08,319 -> 00:05:08,823
Thanks.

65
00:05:13,695 -> 00:05:15,488
Richi! Brother!

66
00:05:16,026 -> 00:05:18,582
Listen to your mom I miss you!
Do you want to stay in my house?

67
00:05:19,164 -> 00:05:20,195
You are a lifesaver ..

68
00:05:20,920 -> 00:05:21,914
Can bring about ...

69
00:05:21,914 -> 00:05:23,378
... I'm going in another direction ...

70
00:05:31,085 -> 00:05:39,262
Hello! Why not fly? My name is Dewey
Much like Tony. Want to play?

71
00:05:39,692 -> 00:05:41,447
But I'm the red team

72
00:05:44,631 -> 00:05:47,174
I do not like listening more than you
Finish quickly.

73
00:05:48,670 -> 00:05:51,100
This book is a mess.
What did you do?

74
00:05:51,457 -> 00:05:52,294
He threw a duck.

75
00:05:53,805 -> 00:05:54,770
And where is your book of algebra?

76
00:05:55,584 -> 00:05:56,400
Which half?

77
00:05:56,738 -> 00:05:57,776
Start with geography.

78
00:05:58,039 -> 00:05:59,254
I have no geography!

79
00:05:59,254 -> 00:06:01,225
Of course if you have notes on it.

80
00:06:02,646 -> 00:06:03,895
Ah, that can not be good.

81
00:06:06,255 -> 00:06:07,550
Mi casa es su casa.

82
00:06:08,164 -> 00:06:12,926
May be the home of my parents,
but a friend down here is worth everything.

83
00:06:13,583 -> 00:06:15,128
What is that smell?

84
00:06:15,518 -> 00:06:19,535
Could be my socks, my pants could be
the rat could be killed.

85
00:06:20,397 -> 00:06:24,574
I think I hurt ... must have entered into a hole
on the wall to die ... or something.

86
00:06:26,614 -> 00:06:27,038
What is this?

87
00:06:27,678 -> 00:06:28,961
Your bed, you have to inflate.

88
00:06:35,131 -> 00:06:36,268
Welcome to the ranch Richi.

89
00:06:38,018 -> 00:06:41,559
Rule No. 1: There are no rules.

90
00:06:42,753 -> 00:06:44,666
Rule No. 2: Do not post the shoes to the couch.

91
00:06:53,221 -> 00:06:54,698
Of course they're real.

92
00:07:04,244 -> 00:07:06,846
! Let What's the answer?
You can do this!

93
00:07:18,274 -> 00:07:20,195
And go over this a million times.

94
00:07:22,087 -> 00:07:27,258
You have to climb the tenths, the tenths have to go somewhere, not floating around the tenth.

95
00:07:28,052 -> 00:07:29,284
Become more intelligent already!

96
00:07:29,601 -> 00:07:31,565
Think! ! Make your brain work!

97
00:07:32,053 -> 00:07:35,286
Could be out doing something else before it but no, I'm stuck doing babysitting ..

98
00:07:36,194 -> 00:07:37,102
4.2

99
00:07:39,637 -> 00:07:40,337
That's right!

100
00:07:41,525 -> 00:07:43,971
I could really understand.

101
00:07:44,613 -> 00:07:46,554
The tenth have to go somewhere

102
00:07:47,394 -> 00:07:48,758
Great, go to the next.

103
00:08:09,410 -> 00:08:11,378
Hal! And down from there.

104
00:08:11,659 -> 00:08:12,395
Hello heaven.

105
00:08:13,178 -> 00:08:14,105
What do you think you're doing?

106
00:08:14,573 -> 00:08:16,603
Under the shingles.

107
00:08:16,899 -> 00:08:19,821
Francis has responsibilities
can not keep covering it.

108
00:08:20,133 -> 00:08:21,988
Oh no, not him.
It is for me.

109
00:08:22,228 -> 00:08:28,347
I wanted fresh air y. .. the view from here is ..
... Is amazing.

110
00:08:29,133 -> 00:08:32,182
Lois you thinking I'm having fun ...

111
00:08:38,193 -> 00:08:42,649
I spent 2 days on this and I even saw a paragraph
that really sucked and then I rewrote it.

112
00:08:43,332 -> 00:08:49,003
Malcolm had never done this before, but last night, I say look I can not stop talking while you try to read.

113
00:08:49,802 -> 00:08:51,231
How about grammar? ... Never mind.

114
00:08:56,363 -> 00:08:58,020
Reese .. this job is like for a 6.

115
00:08:59,505 -> 00:09:01,134
Great! Good job!

116
00:09:01,711 -> 00:09:02,378
You do not say to look good, right?

117
00:09:02,378 -> 00:09:04,535
No this is the best job I've seen
do.

118
00:09:04,909 -> 00:09:07,614
If! great, would not have done without you ... thanks Malcolm.

119
00:09:12,319 -> 00:09:13,380
I kicked his ass.

120
00:09:14,382 -> 00:09:15,711
"You got another 5?

121
00:09:15,971 -> 00:09:18,167
Mom read that work, not for 5.

122
00:09:18,167 -> 00:09:18,821
So what is this?

123
00:09:19,024 -> 00:09:20,707
We studied 4 hours a night.

124
00:09:20,707 -> 00:09:25,538
You know what? That's not enough, to study 8 hours per night
if that's what it takes to upload your grades.

125
00:09:25,538 -> 00:09:26,162
And it will!

126
00:09:26,162 -> 00:09:26,925
Mom!

127
00:09:26,925 -> 00:09:31,940
I do not see your mom, I'm just a janitor with
2 prisoners outside their cells. Now again there.

128
00:09:39,472 -> 00:09:40,226
I'm fine!

129
00:09:41,083 -> 00:09:41,926
I'm fine!

130
00:09:47,519 -> 00:09:50,253
I'm freezing but not heat
because justice is on my side.

131
00:09:51,397 -> 00:09:54,494
Mom surrender, surrender and be so sweet.

132
00:09:57,927 -> 00:09:59,097
Could you do that in the bathroom, Richie?

133
00:10:00,284 -> 00:10:03,007
Brother, nobody will come there for at least 6 hours.

134
00:10:03,598 -> 00:10:05,489
Then do it over a trash can.

135
00:10:06,710 -> 00:10:08,615
And could remove pornography for 5 minutes?

136
00:10:09,198 -> 00:10:12,038
Yes, it is over.
I will put "the girls at the conference"

137
00:10:12,038 -> 00:10:13,721
No, no, no more porn!

138
00:10:14,382 -> 00:10:15,996
Brother, that's a documentary

139
00:10:19,880 -> 00:10:22,049
Au!, God! My eye!

140
00:10:22,863 -> 00:10:26,488
Try to find that one Francis,
walk disgusting stuff.

141
00:10:27,959 -> 00:10:30,176
We Reese, the test is in two hours.

142
00:10:30,694 -> 00:10:36,191
Malcolm never too pass this exam. T or F There are 30 questions, 5 test. It is impossible.

143
00:10:36,597 -> 00:10:38,255
Then Reese, today is the big test.

144
00:10:38,675 -> 00:10:41,112
How much you have to get to not go to class
slow learner?

145
00:10:41,785 -> 00:10:42,491
Nine!

146
00:10:44,362 -> 00:10:45,597
Guys, it seriously.

147
00:10:46,332 -> 00:10:48,179
But you're an idiot.

148
00:10:50,086 -> 00:10:50,833
You're right.

149
00:10:52,396 -> 00:10:57,494
Yes, the only way to pass the idiot test is if someone does it for the idiot, are you stupid?

150
00:10:58,847 -> 00:11:00,597
Steve established the precedent had the chance ...

151
00:11:00,597 -> 00:11:04,143
... But not answered and rest your right
therefore it is a mutual agreement.

152
00:11:05,761 -> 00:11:11,192
What do I do? I can not go to class for slow learners. Go to the cafeteria Rising up the belt.

153
00:11:11,974 -> 00:11:16,663
Loi Unless perhaps you're right,
maybe someone should take the test for you

154
00:11:17,502 -> 00:11:18,085
You mean cheat?

155
00:11:19,868 -> 00:11:26,026
Mom can not cheat and kill us is wrong.
And most importantly, Mom will kill us.

156
00:11:26,333 -> 00:11:28,244
Hey we run out of options here, Reese.

157
00:11:28,447 -> 00:11:29,378
They're going to discover

158
00:11:29,599 -> 00:11:34,050
No, they will not, do you know why?.
We have 4 bright minds to help plan it.

159
00:11:34,558 -> 00:11:36,298
You had to appeal to my vanity right?

160
00:11:36,989 -> 00:11:37,533
I am inside.

161
00:11:38,130 -> 00:11:42,644
Sorry, but the honor compels me to report this conversation with the deputy

162
00:11:42,942 -> 00:11:46,415
Then the honor to report that requires us to sleep
with a sheet of elmo.

163
00:11:46,881 -> 00:11:47,583
Okay I'm inside.

164
00:12:00,658 -> 00:12:02,711
Here is the video-cassettera ordered.

165
00:12:03,019 -> 00:12:04,335
I did not order a video cassettera ..

166
00:12:04,335 -> 00:12:09,789
If you did, check with confidence.
Be the extension number, there is someone out there right now.

167
00:12:10,377 -> 00:12:10,909
That will not be ..

168
00:12:10,909 -> 00:12:15,284
Watch the audio-visual equipment and class name is here on page 7 in the letter that is not a student.

169
00:12:18,346 -> 00:12:19,707
Right. Can leave.

170
00:12:20,879 -> 00:12:21,598
Alright!

171
00:12:22,143 -> 00:12:25,023
No, said he wanted the cart.
So I do not have it.

172
00:12:25,720 -> 00:12:27,285
With your permission I will push to the door.

173
00:12:28,864 -> 00:12:29,745
Ah, here it is.

174
00:12:48,428 -> 00:12:50,397
Be the cannonball.

175
00:12:57,600 -> 00:12:58,191
Are you okay?

176
00:12:58,943 -> 00:13:01,319
Way to go! Bolido

177
00:13:37,224 -> 00:13:38,823
Ay! I have found the rat.

178
00:13:41,646 -> 00:13:48,193
No Tony, that's not fair. Today is my cartoon before school, and yours is after school.

179
00:13:50,099 -> 00:13:54,630
Well Tony, as you want .. and anyway I wanted to
be your friend.

180
00:14:04,300 -> 00:14:07,743
Tony, I can not get angry with you either.

181
00:14:09,038 -> 00:14:09,518
Takes

182
00:14:11,491 -> 00:14:12,816
Do you already have the results of the test of history?

183
00:14:12,816 -> 00:14:13,758
No! I have not seen yet!

184
00:14:14,398 -> 00:14:16,556
You'd better have removed a 9!

185
00:14:19,129 -> 00:14:20,495
Hey, I'm not calling Francis to work yet?

186
00:14:20,972 -> 00:14:22,744
No, I have not spoken to him since ..

187
00:14:22,744 -> 00:14:25,317
Think you're going to try something cutting all contact.

188
00:14:26,088 -> 00:14:30,380
He should know .. that until
diculpe is really no reason to call ...

189
00:14:30,905 -> 00:14:34,243
I can not wait to see your expression when
realize that as we discovered.

190
00:14:35,267 -> 00:14:36,419
Oh, and we have to discover what, honey?

191
00:14:36,883 -> 00:14:38,214
I will not give

192
00:14:40,060 -> 00:14:42,527
You know that I will get to the distance.

193
00:14:43,435 -> 00:14:44,955
I think she likes the tomatoes on their sandwiches.

194
00:14:45,494 -> 00:14:46,198
In the other bag Hal!

195
00:14:48,526 -> 00:14:52,103
A wonderful 9 Malcolm,
never would a ridiculous as this.

196
00:14:53,122 -> 00:14:55,272
This I find very disturbing 5

197
00:14:55,991 -> 00:14:59,085
Something stinks

198
00:14:59,649 -> 00:15:03,153
He knows that we cheated, we will have to deal separately.

199
00:15:03,884 -> 00:15:06,789
Darni he knows nothing, I'll go talk to him.

200
00:15:08,995 -> 00:15:10,744
Mr. Woodward.
I'm Malcolm's brother Reese.

201
00:15:10,992 -> 00:15:11,788
Oh hi, how are you?

202
00:15:12,287 -> 00:15:15,944
Reese is upset, thinks he deserves more than a 5 on your screen history.

203
00:15:16,527 -> 00:15:19,881
Review and think is not bad.

204
00:15:20,694 -> 00:15:23,148
Believed that there would be another way to have a look.

205
00:15:23,400 -> 00:15:27,790
Malcolm should congratulate you for your fraternity.
But the test is worth 5.

206
00:15:28,244 -> 00:15:30,446
Maybe if Mr. Woodward reviewed again ..

207
00:15:30,805 -> 00:15:34,321
I can not spend much time in Reese,
it would be unfair to other students.

208
00:15:34,631 -> 00:15:36,615
But did not deserve a 5 therein.

209
00:15:36,958 -> 00:15:41,102
Malcolm looks have been a teacher long time
and I think I know what Reese is capable.

210
00:15:41,583 -> 00:15:43,135
I really do not think it ...

211
00:15:43,135 -> 00:15:48,996
Hey, do not want to hear this about your brother.
But I've known guys like Reese all my life.

212
00:15:49,354 -> 00:15:52,539
They are the ones you throw water to look like you peed your pants.

213
00:15:53,216 -> 00:15:57,210
Point to your legs to play ball and fall to the floor and break your chin ..

214
00:15:57,590 -> 00:16:01,743
And I have to fix with no wires and your teeth
are correctly

215
00:16:02,030 -> 00:16:08,350
And spent 6 years in orthodontics with the most painful and equipment ever designed embarasoso

216
00:16:08,919 -> 00:16:14,121
And that was only because they were not aware of themselves.

217
00:16:15,789 -> 00:16:17,366
It is totally against you

218
00:16:17,868 -> 00:16:19,921
Man, only used as an excuse.

219
00:16:20,384 -> 00:16:22,348
It will die when mom finds out.

220
00:16:22,614 -> 00:16:25,618
Reese can not blame him, if he betrayed
Mom will know you cheated.

221
00:16:29,137 -> 00:16:29,978
I'm dead!

222
00:16:30,818 -> 00:16:41,458
The 2 following 1, 3 follows 2, 4 is to 3,
Something follows something and then we got to 10!

223
00:16:49,339 -> 00:16:50,998
God!

224
00:16:50,998 -> 00:16:52,968
Thank God!, You're here
I feared that would give you the message at work

225
00:16:53,226 -> 00:16:53,739
What happened to you?

226
00:16:53,739 -> 00:16:55,005
Hey, how do you want your burger?

227
00:16:55,278 -> 00:16:55,980
Just one second, friend

228
00:16:56,287 -> 00:17:02,257
I have it all arranged. Tell your mom you want to repair the mower and then I'm fooling around y. ..

229
00:17:02,257 -> 00:17:03,804
No, no, no, I will not do that Francis.

230
00:17:04,209 -> 00:17:08,103
Decide soon Hey, this is melting pot cheap.

231
00:17:08,381 -> 00:17:12,105
Maybe you could talk to her, calm her down a bit so you can go home, maybe today ..

232
00:17:12,105 -> 00:17:14,726
Francis please get you to stop in the middle.

233
00:17:15,006 -> 00:17:16,574
What will you leave that wins this round too?

234
00:17:16,574 -> 00:17:20,662
Francis is nothing I can do, you know what is the problem? You and your mother are exactly alike.

235
00:17:20,662 -> 00:17:21,630
That's a lie.

236
00:17:21,886 -> 00:17:26,490
That's true. Both are foolish and imcapaces to bow. So good ... won.

237
00:17:26,817 -> 00:17:29,099
Congratulations that your prize is ...

238
00:17:29,649 -> 00:17:33,277
If you'll excuse me I have to go,
smells like something died here.

239
00:17:33,756 -> 00:17:34,522
Take!

240
00:17:36,823 -> 00:17:40,149
Your father is right man, sometimes you're so stupid.

241
00:17:47,194 -> 00:17:49,709
Sorry, no one wanted to prove so.

242
00:17:50,226 -> 00:17:51,651
I feel that I failed to Reese.

243
00:17:52,668 -> 00:17:53,677
Just do not stop Tony.

244
00:17:55,121 -> 00:17:56,311
So .. what does this leave us?

245
00:17:57,449 -> 00:18:00,368
I think the best thing is to change it as soon as possible.

246
00:18:02,557 -> 00:18:04,382
Must see this as an opportunity.

247
00:18:05,137 -> 00:18:06,915
Opportunity to be in the kind of silly.

248
00:18:08,369 -> 00:18:11,427
Reese is not what I wanted,
but let us not choice.

249
00:18:16,100 -> 00:18:20,758
Mama do not, not the fault of Reese
did not deserve a 5 on your screen.

250
00:18:21,008 -> 00:18:23,072
Malcolm already had this discussion.

251
00:18:23,494 -> 00:18:25,959
I saw his test and he did a good job, deserved a 9.

252
00:18:26,370 -> 00:18:28,288
This guy is against

253
00:18:28,288 -> 00:18:32,559
I'm sorry you feel that way but you can not blame me
the defects of your brother.

254
00:18:32,792 -> 00:18:35,248
Mom this is your test, look at this question ..

255
00:18:36,348 -> 00:18:40,037
What was the cause of the Great Depression?
He replied on Thursday, black, is the correct answer.

256
00:18:40,270 -> 00:18:41,820
No this is a partial response.

257
00:18:42,196 -> 00:18:46,256
To get all the credit should have included the vast overproduction of U.S. ...

258
00:18:46,460 -> 00:18:48,320
... Protectionism in foreign markets ...

259
00:18:48,584 -> 00:18:51,208
... On credit expansion and speculation in the stock market.

260
00:18:51,553 -> 00:18:53,415
Yes, it would have been the correct answer.

261
00:18:53,646 -> 00:18:56,085
You did not read the answer
because that is what I wrote.

262
00:18:57,290 -> 00:18:58,585
"I signed up?

263
00:19:01,120 -> 00:19:01,718
What I noticed!

264
00:19:02,367 -> 00:19:06,834
Reese did and it seems that we all identify with what he is going through.

265
00:19:07,895 -> 00:19:13,631
Did you do this test, no?
You cheated!

266
00:19:14,558 -> 00:19:16,069
"I left for you to cheat?

267
00:19:17,598 -> 00:19:19,965
He put a 5 to something he wrote

268
00:19:21,699 -> 00:19:23,091
You if you are against

269
00:19:24,052 -> 00:19:29,177
And want to see him removed or fired or whatever they do to the hombresillos who abuse their power.

270
00:19:29,450 -> 00:19:31,167
No need for insults.

271
00:19:31,638 -> 00:19:34,092
Le sugieron we leave things as they are.

272
00:19:34,350 -> 00:19:36,097
Oh no, do not think so!

273
00:19:36,540 -> 00:19:41,302
This is the situation, if you notify the school, then the school will know that Malcolm cheated and ejected.

274
00:19:42,725 -> 00:19:44,149
It threatens me!

275
00:19:44,991 -> 00:19:51,598
It is not a threat. Just do not think that he gave his son that if he meets ... for ... well .. Reese.

276
00:19:51,948 -> 00:19:53,415
Think you do not sacrifice this one?

277
00:19:55,552 -> 00:20:00,411
Let me explain something to you. Malcolm would leave the
sabar creek without thinking for Reese.

278
00:20:00,411 -> 00:20:00,839
What?

279
00:20:01,114 -> 00:20:02,758
Malcolm would be fine no matter what.

280
00:20:03,258 -> 00:20:06,928
He may go to an expensive university or working in the bureaucracy, but come to management.

281
00:20:07,505 -> 00:20:09,249
Reese is the one that needs to be saved

282
00:20:11,833 -> 00:20:12,677
I can not believe it.

283
00:20:14,647 -> 00:20:17,867
No mother can be so cruel to his own son.

284
00:20:21,866 -> 00:20:26,057
Mama please leave me cold and I have again I have hunger.

285
00:20:26,570 -> 00:20:32,729
Please will repair the roof and paint the house, I'll do anything, Mom. Only dajame enter.

286
00:20:33,540 -> 00:20:38,160
Let me live under one roof I want to be warm.
Mom please.

287
00:20:40,130 -> 00:20:41,490
Maybe we can do something about it.

288
00:20:45,104 -> 00:20:47,021
Stay there Tony, Good evening.

289
00:20:49,699 -> 00:20:51,728
Oh god, look at the size of that thing.

290
00:20:52,467 -> 00:20:54,122
Aaaah, Dewey what is wrong with you?

291
00:20:55,131 -> 00:20:56,552
Run Tony Run!

292
00:20:57,729 -> 00:20:59,773
Why always called Tony?

293
00:21:01,130 -> 00:21:03,870
Goodbye Tony. I love you.

294
00:21:15,497 -> 00:21:20,677
If it is cold and dangerous. But I think we did well if we hurry to end in a week.

295
00:21:21,245 -> 00:21:22,884
Hey hurry up!

296
00:21:23,557 -> 00:21:25,756
I try, I have pitch in his eyes.

9999
00:00:0,500 -> 00:00:2,00
<font color="#ffff00" size=14> www.tvsubtitles.net </ font>

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>
