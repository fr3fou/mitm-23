1
00:00:09,300 -> 00:00:10,200
Hey.

2
00:00:10,800 -> 00:00:12,100
Does your branch is bigger than mine?

3
00:00:13,000 -> 00:00:15,300
I do not know. Are just branches.

4
00:00:15,300 -> 00:00:17,300
Yes, but how the industry got bigger?

5
00:00:20,900 -> 00:00:23,000
I always get broken branches.

6
00:00:23,800 -> 00:00:25,800
Why does everything in me is so bad?

7
00:00:26,800 -> 00:00:28,400
I never get anything good!

8
00:00:28,900 -> 00:00:30,100
My life sucks!

9
00:00:32,800 -> 00:00:33,700
Give me that.

10
00:00:38,600 -> 00:00:40,900
Sometimes unfortunate things
solve everything.

11
00:01:20,410 -> 00:01:22,410
I do not understand why we need a nanny.

12
00:01:22,410 -> 00:01:24,610
Yes, especially because only
 would be for two days.

13
00:01:24,610 -> 00:01:26,110
Why not trust us?

14
00:01:27,310 -> 00:01:28,810
It is not fair.

15
00:01:30,710 -> 00:01:31,810
I hope they manage themselves.

16
00:01:32,010 -> 00:01:34,810
 the nurse came in two hours.

17
00:01:34,910 -> 00:01:37,410
Do nothing.

18
00:01:42,110 -> 00:01:45,810
Honey, come on. I see Britney
6:30, do not want to be late.

19
00:01:52,210 -> 00:01:53,510
Goodbye!

20
00:01:55,310 -> 00:01:56,310
See what happens?

21
00:01:56,310 -> 00:01:58,310
We said we did not want nanny ...

22
00:01:58,310 -> 00:01:59,310
... And we listened.

23
00:01:59,410 -> 00:02:01,677
So now you have to suffer.

24
00:02:13,320 -> 00:02:14,620
What is that?

25
00:02:15,020 -> 00:02:16,320
It's the cesspool.

26
00:02:16,320 -> 00:02:17,420
Is it like a pool?

27
00:02:17,620 -> 00:02:18,820
Is drainage of the house.

28
00:02:19,520 -> 00:02:23,120
Pets are dead
and bacteria of all kinds.

29
00:02:23,120 -> 00:02:25,175
Hurry, it sucks.

30
00:02:30,720 -> 00:02:31,820
Great.

31
00:02:32,420 -> 00:02:34,720
Vamos! Arrive at any moment!

32
00:02:34,720 -> 00:02:37,998
Sorry. We let
"Lemonade" in the refrigerator.

33
00:02:58,220 -> 00:03:00,079
Maybe scared and left.

34
00:03:26,030 -> 00:03:27,930
Hey guys, I'm Patty.

35
00:03:30,130 -> 00:03:31,530
I'm your babysitter.

36
00:03:33,930 -> 00:03:36,050
"We apologize for a second?

37
00:03:53,530 -> 00:03:55,830
I hope Barbara and Tom come
this year ...

38
00:03:55,830 -> 00:03:57,530
... Are some people very funny.

39
00:03:58,230 -> 00:04:00,830
Well, I'm sure Jack Kanilly
going to be there.

40
00:04:00,830 -> 00:04:02,930
Honey, why do not you talk to him?

41
00:04:02,930 -> 00:04:04,689
It is the most reasonable

42
00:04:04,830 -> 00:04:08,830
Talk to me will not change anything
is something to meet you.

43
00:04:09,030 -> 00:04:10,330
Already exceeded.

44
00:04:10,340 -> 00:04:11,340
Not true.

45
00:04:12,140 -> 00:04:14,940
It's all of what you speak
whenever we

46
00:04:14,940 -> 00:04:19,940
As stole your idea for improving
competition by 4% in 1998 ...

47
00:04:21,240 -> 00:04:22,640
Honey, you're obsessed.

48
00:04:22,640 -> 00:04:23,640
I'm not obsessed!

49
00:04:26,340 -> 00:04:29,240
Only I have this look
he always gives me.

50
00:04:30,340 -> 00:04:32,240
And those little chills disjointed.

51
00:04:35,240 -> 00:04:38,040
Did I tell you the story of how Ephen Vegans
he grew his land?

52
00:04:38,040 -> 00:04:41,440
Yes, a thousand times, but never mind
because the count again.

53
00:04:41,440 -> 00:04:46,440
Well, first it was a stolen space
Zylla, but it would not kill him ....

54
00:04:47,440 -> 00:04:49,840
So guys, what kind
snack's want to eat?

55
00:04:51,940 -> 00:04:52,640
Excuse me?

56
00:04:52,840 -> 00:04:55,840
Well, I could make some popcorn
or chocolate biscuits.

57
00:04:56,640 -> 00:04:58,740
But Mom says that these things are not healthy.

58
00:04:58,740 -> 00:05:00,540
Okay, they are so cute!

59
00:05:05,240 -> 00:05:05,740
Hello?

60
00:05:05,840 -> 00:05:08,640
Malcolm, how are you? Listen, I need
do me a favor.

61
00:05:08,640 -> 00:05:11,640
There are 200 or 300 identifiable
false in the washer.

62
00:05:11,640 -> 00:05:14,640
Now that mom is not safe
transfer to the garage.

63
00:05:14,650 -> 00:05:16,750
But Francis, I can not
do that now.

64
00:05:16,750 -> 00:05:17,750
What?

65
00:05:17,750 -> 00:05:18,750
What are you talking about?

66
00:05:18,750 -> 00:05:20,750
"Francis? Is that Francis?

67
00:05:20,450 -> 00:05:23,450
Tell Patty Anderson of the
great bra is here.

68
00:05:23,450 -> 00:05:25,250
Patty Anderson sends you greetings.

69
00:05:25,250 -> 00:05:28,250
My God! Your nanny is Patty Anderson?

70
00:05:28,250 -> 00:05:29,250
Let me talk to him.

71
00:05:29,250 -> 00:05:30,750
Do not leave it ...!
"Hi!

72
00:05:31,150 -> 00:05:32,950
Hello ... Patty ...

73
00:05:32,950 -> 00:05:34,450
Been a long time!

74
00:05:35,150 -> 00:05:36,850
You probably will not remember me.

75
00:05:40,250 -> 00:05:41,150
Hi Francis!

76
00:05:41,150 -> 00:05:42,150
Hello ... Patty ...

77
00:05:45,960 -> 00:05:47,960
Yeah, I remember you, how ...

78
00:05:47,960 -> 00:05:51,960
- What happened? Do you have to use the phone? Sorry
Patty I have to go, bye!

79
00:05:53,460 -> 00:05:55,260
Francis is so great.

80
00:05:55,260 -> 00:05:57,760
He was the only kid who always
 was good to me.

81
00:06:00,560 -> 00:06:03,260
Come on guys! Not so fat!

82
00:06:04,960 -> 00:06:06,260
That cute!

83
00:06:06,760 -> 00:06:07,760
It's so cute!

84
00:06:08,360 -> 00:06:10,760
Yes .. I'm very like him.

85
00:06:11,360 -> 00:06:15,160
I'll tell you, before dinner
Why not order the house together?

86
00:06:15,160 -> 00:06:16,160
Good idea!

87
00:06:16,170 -> 00:06:17,170
Great!

88
00:06:37,470 -> 00:06:41,968
Look! They did very similar to a television
free on the beach, and there that the food PPS.

89
00:06:42,770 -> 00:06:43,970
They are Barbara and Tom.

90
00:06:46,670 -> 00:06:47,970
There is Kanilly.

91
00:06:47,970 -> 00:06:49,970
For the love of God, Hal!

92
00:06:50,370 -> 00:06:53,270
You have to overcome
just reach out and talk.

93
00:06:53,570 -> 00:06:55,270
Despejate!

94
00:06:59,470 -> 00:07:00,470
Okay, according ....

95
00:07:00,470 -> 00:07:01,467
Coming.

96
00:07:23,970 -> 00:07:27,788
What do you do when you have a
amazing woman in your room?

97
00:07:28,380 -> 00:07:32,280
O. .. I ... I ...

98
00:07:33,280 -> 00:07:36,280
It's the best thing that happened to me, bring the
premature.

99
00:07:36,580 -> 00:07:38,280
Well, nice to meet you guys.

100
00:07:38,280 -> 00:07:39,280
You want something?

101
00:07:41,880 -> 00:07:42,880
Well.

102
00:07:42,880 -> 00:07:43,880
Okay.

103
00:07:43,880 -> 00:07:44,880
Have fun.

104
00:07:47,380 -> 00:07:50,180
She is a trophy as a babysitter.

105
00:07:50,680 -> 00:07:53,380
Impacted me ... deep ...

106
00:07:53,380 -> 00:07:56,680
I wonder if you know how
get a shirt.

107
00:07:57,290 -> 00:07:58,690
What about you?

108
00:07:59,290 -> 00:08:00,690
How could you do this?

109
00:08:00,690 -> 00:08:02,290
What are you talking about?

110
00:08:02,290 -> 00:08:06,886
Invite the fools who consider Patty
like a piece of meat.

111
00:08:07,290 -> 00:08:10,090
Mom and Dad will pay good money.
She is ours!

112
00:08:10,090 -> 00:08:10,890
We're going.

113
00:08:10,890 -> 00:08:13,290
He will not do anything with it at home.

114
00:08:14,590 -> 00:08:16,690
fence, is Kryptonite.

115
00:08:16,890 -> 00:08:22,690
So ... Is this the teddy Reese?
It's so charming!

116
00:08:22,690 -> 00:08:25,994
Suddenly I see you have
a fututo ..

117
00:08:26,094 -> 00:08:28,265
I never saw it ... just ...

118
00:08:29,400 -> 00:08:31,763
Whenever I was so sorry Patty.

119
00:08:32,400 -> 00:08:35,118
I was in love with me ...

120
00:08:35,768 -> 00:08:38,382
used to follow me everywhere

121
00:08:38,811 -> 00:08:40,750
Big arms, very unpleasant

122
00:08:41,200 -> 00:08:44,134
... I mean, it was nice and had
feelings but

123
00:08:44,334 -> 00:08:48,401
you can do when he likes you
someone so horrible

124
00:08:48,700 -> 00:08:50,800
Gave a good fight!

125
00:08:50,800 -> 00:08:52,800
No. .. I'm ashamed of it.

126
00:08:52,800 -> 00:08:55,000
Hey, he stole your idea!

127
00:08:55,500 -> 00:08:59,000
How often can happen to you
ideas to improve something at 4%?

128
00:08:59,200 -> 00:09:01,621
at least you did
scream like a girl.

129
00:09:01,756 -> 00:09:02,977
No, that was me.

130
00:09:03,300 -> 00:09:06,591
I do not know what happened to Hal, never
had been doing so.

131
00:09:06,710 -> 00:09:10,310
Also this time there was no
provocation ... or false testimony.

132
00:09:10,310 -> 00:09:12,110
Men are animals.

133
00:09:13,110 -> 00:09:15,110
Or at least that I was told.

134
00:09:15,510 -> 00:09:17,210
Are you already drunk?

135
00:09:17,510 -> 00:09:21,014
No, I wish I could but I have to go back
my things in 24 hours.

136
00:09:23,410 -> 00:09:25,510
Look how stupid I am.

137
00:09:25,510 -> 00:09:29,531
I mean, these are people I worked with
and thus should not quarrel.

138
00:09:31,110 -> 00:09:33,510
Should apologize to Kennelly.

139
00:09:34,210 -> 00:09:39,510
Did you know that can be used here
wear whatever without even rent it?

140
00:09:39,510 -> 00:09:42,510
Well, I knew I could with
T-shirts of the kids but ...

141
00:09:51,820 -> 00:09:56,520
Enough is enough, stop fighting!

142
00:09:57,220 -> 00:09:58,820
Do not stand there, Do Something!

143
00:09:59,620 -> 00:10:01,894
- You Look another drink.
- Okay

144
00:10:11,520 -> 00:10:12,520
What?

145
00:10:16,120 -> 00:10:17,520
What are you doing?

146
00:10:17,520 -> 00:10:18,820
What are you doing?

147
00:10:22,820 -> 00:10:23,820
Here you go.

148
00:10:31,320 -> 00:10:32,320
Hungry?

149
00:10:32,820 -> 00:10:34,320
I do not know because I am.

150
00:10:34,530 -> 00:10:35,330
"Dewey?

151
00:10:35,530 -> 00:10:37,377
Go ahead guys, eat.

152
00:10:40,630 -> 00:10:42,538
These potatoes are heavenly.

153
00:10:42,673 -> 00:10:43,788
Thanks.

154
00:10:46,230 -> 00:10:50,730
yesterday in my gifted class.
Not that I would be, by so called "class."

155
00:10:50,731 -> 00:10:52,930
We explained how to feed
other bodies.

156
00:10:53,330 -> 00:10:54,830
It covers diseases
cows.

157
00:10:54,830 -> 00:10:58,830
Started because they said using dead cows
is fed to other cows.

158
00:10:59,630 -> 00:11:04,130
Basically, the brain becomes
in soups with brains.

159
00:11:04,430 -> 00:11:10,130
It is very similar to a disease with
cannibals, because they eat brains.

160
00:11:16,140 -> 00:11:19,940
Hey Patty, let me ask.
What is your address?

161
00:11:20,040 -> 00:11:21,740
Northcand 531.

162
00:11:21,740 -> 00:11:22,740
What is your favorite color?

163
00:11:22,740 -> 00:11:24,540
I dunno, I guess blue.

164
00:11:24,740 -> 00:11:26,540
Mine too.

165
00:11:30,840 -> 00:11:36,540
"Hello Patty, address Nortchand 531
and her favorite color is blue, like mine "

166
00:11:41,540 -> 00:11:44,174
I can dance with me, let me show you.

167
00:11:44,540 -> 00:11:45,540
All right.

168
00:12:03,840 -> 00:12:05,540
This is embarrassing.

169
00:12:08,950 -> 00:12:13,550
My God you are an angel! That is a
very nice scene.

170
00:12:19,650 -> 00:12:21,250
Why does the dishes?

171
00:12:21,250 -> 00:12:23,250
I do not know, just shut up.

172
00:12:34,150 -> 00:12:35,450
Very good!

173
00:12:40,750 -> 00:12:42,850
Gosh, It was under the bed!

174
00:12:43,350 -> 00:12:44,350
Here it is!

175
00:12:44,450 -> 00:12:46,550
Wait just a little more.

176
00:12:46,850 -> 00:12:49,550
My God, just threw it against the wall.

177
00:12:49,550 -> 00:12:51,050
I grabbed it, is this!

178
00:13:04,050 -> 00:13:07,150
Well, now you're completely clean.

179
00:13:09,000 -> 00:13:10,800
Now put on your pajamas.

180
00:13:15,800 -> 00:13:17,300
Hi guys.

181
00:13:17,300 -> 00:13:19,300
Well, stop the role of the cute little thing.

182
00:13:19,300 -> 00:13:20,900
What cute little thing?

183
00:13:20,900 -> 00:13:21,700
You!

184
00:13:21,700 -> 00:13:24,700
Get out with your big eyes and your
finite voice!

185
00:13:24,700 -> 00:13:26,600
I have to resist
ruin my efforts.

186
00:13:26,600 -> 00:13:28,100
I'm not doing anything!

187
00:13:28,100 -> 00:13:30,100
Yes? So what is it?

188
00:13:31,210 -> 00:13:32,110
Nothing!

189
00:13:34,510 -> 00:13:36,610
Are you going to do a card?

190
00:13:36,610 -> 00:13:37,610
No!

191
00:13:38,710 -> 00:13:40,610
Do you like glitter, Dewey?

192
00:13:44,310 -> 00:13:45,010
Dewey!

193
00:13:46,410 -> 00:13:50,010
This is his way of being, is a
walking disaster for this area.

194
00:13:51,410 -> 00:13:53,210
I guess I need another shower!

195
00:13:54,110 -> 00:13:55,110
Vamos!

196
00:14:03,310 -> 00:14:06,110
And not much ice this time
 I'm not cold.

197
00:14:08,610 -> 00:14:12,010
Hey, why not pay for dinner and
we get benefits?

198
00:14:12,020 -> 00:14:14,220
Are you abusing me because I'm drunk?

199
00:14:14,220 -> 00:14:15,020
Yes.

200
00:14:15,220 -> 00:14:16,620
Hopefully he did.

201
00:14:17,520 -> 00:14:18,320
Okay.

202
00:14:19,620 -> 00:14:21,720
I hope you're proud
yourself.

203
00:14:21,720 -> 00:14:26,720
I can not help it! I do not know what it is.
It's like this man gives some presumption ...

204
00:14:27,020 -> 00:14:29,820
... And makes my hair stand on end and
I want to tear it down!

205
00:14:29,820 -> 00:14:31,820
I never would fight me and someone.

206
00:14:32,020 -> 00:14:36,320
Of course occasionally yell at others, always
that the window of the car is lifted.

207
00:14:36,820 -> 00:14:39,020
I just say ... "thanks."

208
00:14:39,330 -> 00:14:40,730
Tom, do not give sermons.

209
00:14:40,930 -> 00:14:42,930
I'm saying that Hal would do what he did
if I could.

210
00:14:42,930 -> 00:14:44,930
But you can not because you're a coward.

211
00:14:45,230 -> 00:14:46,430
That's my point.

212
00:14:48,430 -> 00:14:53,030
And I have Sr.Solins in mathematics
Do you think you change your pants? I think not ...

213
00:14:53,030 -> 00:14:54,030
Really?

214
00:14:54,030 -> 00:14:57,530
And I keep talking!
I lost track of time!

215
00:14:57,530 -> 00:15:00,030
97 minutes go

216
00:15:00,030 -> 00:15:01,630
It was so nice talking to you!

217
00:15:02,330 -> 00:15:03,830
Yes, yes ... you too.

218
00:15:03,830 -> 00:15:05,830
You were always so nice to me.

219
00:15:05,830 -> 00:15:09,830
Well, you deserve it ...
because you're a good person.

220
00:15:10,230 -> 00:15:15,630
I will use a shirt of yours to sleep ...
I hope you do not mind ...

221
00:15:15,640 -> 00:15:17,440
No, no.

222
00:15:19,440 -> 00:15:24,640
Anyway, I do not know how to say this
so I just tell him ...

223
00:15:24,640 -> 00:15:26,640
I think you are really special.

224
00:15:27,440 -> 00:15:34,240
Ohi ... coming in a couple of weeks
and my parents will be out of town ...

225
00:15:34,240 -> 00:15:39,202
... And thought you might stay in
my house and we could ... well ... you know ...

226
00:15:40,340 -> 00:15:42,440
Patty Listen, I have to say this ...

227
00:15:42,440 -> 00:15:44,840
... Sorry but I do not get that to you ...

228
00:15:45,440 -> 00:15:49,840
... I feel so ... no physical attraction to you ...

229
00:15:51,040 -> 00:15:52,440
... And ... all ...

230
00:15:53,340 -> 00:15:54,840
... I think of you only as a friend.

231
00:15:57,350 -> 00:15:59,550
Patty Oh, now I hurt your feelings.

232
00:15:59,550 -> 00:16:02,423
I know it's hard to believe but

233
00:16:02,424 -> 00:16:06,088
out there someone you
encotraba physically attractive ...

234
00:16:06,123 -> 00:16:08,050
... And you'll find ... and when you do ...

235
00:16:08,050 -> 00:16:12,050
Francis I understand it, there's someone for me out there
and not you!

236
00:16:12,250 -> 00:16:13,650
That's the spirit!

237
00:16:18,350 -> 00:16:19,650
You had to do.

238
00:16:19,650 -> 00:16:25,550
It's sad when you steal someone's happiness ...
This is going to go straight to the refrigerator.

239
00:16:27,450 -> 00:16:29,250
Hey Patty, do you want to play something?

240
00:16:29,750 -> 00:16:31,350
Not now.

241
00:16:35,750 -> 00:16:36,750
Where you going?

242
00:16:36,760 -> 00:16:38,960
To find out what is wrong, and make her feel better.

243
00:16:38,960 -> 00:16:41,560
No, I'll go see what happened and make you feel better!

244
00:16:41,560 -> 00:16:43,460
Only'll feel more sad!

245
00:16:43,460 -> 00:16:44,860
I have to be sensitive.

246
00:16:44,860 -> 00:16:46,560
You are stupid and insensitive.

247
00:16:46,560 -> 00:16:47,560
I'll break your ass!

248
00:16:50,160 -> 00:16:51,560
Say that I can make you feel better!

249
00:16:51,560 -> 00:16:52,560
No!

250
00:17:00,460 -> 00:17:01,960
You're so sweet.

251
00:17:05,660 -> 00:17:06,960
It's nice.

252
00:17:08,170 -> 00:17:10,970
I hate to be nice!

253
00:17:14,370 -> 00:17:18,570
I feel great
maybe it was the food.

254
00:17:20,070 -> 00:17:21,570
"Hal's my ...?

255
00:17:22,170 -> 00:17:23,070
"Where is Hal?

256
00:17:28,070 -> 00:17:31,070
I used to have a life more
quieter than this, I apologize.

257
00:17:50,970 -> 00:17:53,470
I can not believe she
sleeping in the bed under the hall.

258
00:17:53,870 -> 00:17:55,470
I can not sleep.

259
00:18:00,470 -> 00:18:01,470
Is it so cute?

260
00:18:07,470 -> 00:18:08,270
What?!

261
00:18:08,770 -> 00:18:09,770
I'm scared.

262
00:18:10,380 -> 00:18:11,780
I had a nightmare.

263
00:18:12,580 -> 00:18:13,780
Poor.

264
00:18:14,780 -> 00:18:16,180
Would you sleep with me?

265
00:18:18,080 -> 00:18:19,180
Okay, let's go.

266
00:18:21,180 -> 00:18:22,180
There.

267
00:18:31,180 -> 00:18:33,773
I can not believe it! I'm supposed to be a genius

268
00:18:33,773 -> 00:18:36,770
What I'm being beaten by a
child who can not tie his shoes?

269
00:18:36,880 -> 00:18:38,680
We can not let him get away with it.

270
00:18:39,480 -> 00:18:41,280
Let's overthrow.

271
00:18:44,280 -> 00:18:46,280
Could you please stop?

272
00:18:46,280 -> 00:18:49,480
You are humiliating me in front of my friends!

273
00:18:50,490 -> 00:18:51,790
I'm fine!

274
00:18:53,890 -> 00:18:55,790
The two big men already!

275
00:18:55,790 -> 00:18:59,090
And not have to go fighting here!

276
00:18:59,090 -> 00:19:00,090
Too late!

277
00:19:00,090 -> 00:19:08,090
I can not, I am a wild animal!
and let nature take its course ...

278
00:19:08,490 -> 00:19:09,890
... And kill!

279
00:19:14,790 -> 00:19:16,790
In 30 seconds ...

280
00:19:16,790 -> 00:19:19,590
I will guide you mentally ...
to go.

281
00:19:19,890 -> 00:19:21,390
Thank you my love, thanks!

282
00:19:21,890 -> 00:19:24,190
And then you have the choice ...

283
00:19:24,500 -> 00:19:28,200
... You can use your animal instincts with him o. ..

284
00:19:29,900 -> 00:19:31,200
... Can return to the hotel ...

285
00:19:32,500 -> 00:19:34,700
... And download this anger me.

286
00:19:44,500 -> 00:19:46,700
Do not play my anger, Lois!

287
00:19:50,300 -> 00:19:53,700
There are things you can not
talk to people like him.

288
00:20:00,300 -> 00:20:02,200
It is a very complicated situation.

289
00:20:02,600 -> 00:20:03,700
I know, honey.

290
00:20:46,400 -> 00:20:47,300
It's working!

291
00:20:47,600 -> 00:20:50,200
Well, I grabbed him and you will
put the tape on his mouth ...

292
00:20:50,400 -> 00:20:51,600
... And then we put it in the garage.

293
00:20:53,910 -> 00:20:54,710
Where did he go?

294
00:20:57,410 -> 00:20:58,310
There it is.

295
00:20:58,810 -> 00:20:59,810
Come to daddy.

296
00:21:08,210 -> 00:21:09,510
The locked!

297
00:21:09,810 -> 00:21:11,910
Dewey, come to bed.

298
00:21:12,210 -> 00:21:13,410
All right.

299
00:21:17,610 -> 00:21:18,710
Great ...

300
00:21:19,310 -> 00:21:21,510
What are we supposed to do now?

301
00:21:27,610 -> 00:21:29,910
My God! What is this?

302
00:21:30,010 -> 00:21:33,210
Well, at least not today
was all a waste.

303
00:21:33,220 -> 00:21:36,020
Heaven ... What is this?
