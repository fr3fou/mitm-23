Why I can not go bowling?

9
00:01:09,901 -> 00:01:12,648
Because they will spend the night in your room.
You are punished.

Only a reproach for their behavior
and you will regret it

20
00:01:36,387 -> 00:01:39,839
Many strikes, a spell
and when they are ready to go ...

21
00:01:40,092 -> 00:01:42,401
... The girls looking at them you will go behind the back.

"I have to go to the bathroom.

160
00:13:44,679 -> 00:13:46,398
"No, no, no no one is going
"But ...

161
00:13:46,398 -> 00:13:49,834
No, not everything should stay the same,
please I need you here

162
00:13:50,246 -> 00:13:53,038
Never ...
had never been so close to this before.

163
00:13:53,888 -> 00:13:57,382
You're part of it,
all are part of it.

164
00:13:58,262 -> 00:14:02,587
All are part of the fabric
my perfect game

165
00:14:03,461 -> 00:14:07,671
Oh my name will be clear that

166
00:14:07,671 -> 00:14:12,024

part of my great success

167
00:14:12,459 -> 00:14:16,412
"Okay, only fast
"Thank you

168
00:14:40,101 -> 00:14:41,863
Only two

169
00:14:41,863 -> 00:14:45,881
- What is your problem?
"Yes, it's just bowling, to relax

170
00:14:46,516 -> 00:14:47,960
I wish we were alone

171
00:14:49,163 -> 00:14:52,915
- Outside?
"There is no security cameras outside, believe me

172
00:15:08,831 -> 00:15:12,535
You see Malcolm's great not having to worry
through the channels, you can play and have fun.

173
00:15:14,379 -> 00:15:16,678
"I wish we were alone
"Me too

I'm still waiting joke

175
00:15:21,005 -> 00:15:28,519
Would you like to walk on the beach and feel the breeze ..
You know what? Not as good joke.

176
00:15:30,195 -> 00:15:31,789
Mom did not want to do this

177
00:15:32,412 -> 00:15:37,115
Malcolm taught you not to give up when something is difficult
You can do this

178
00:15:37,505 -> 00:15:39,964
Just concentrate on the pines
Throw the ball

179
00:15:40,321 -> 00:15:42,542
Do not give up until you make a strike

180
00:15:43,261 -> 00:15:47,074
"Your mother is right connie
- My name is Connie!

181
00:15:47,791 -> 00:15:49,855
"Okay mom, you want to see a strike?

182
00:15:51,519 -> 00:15:55,474
Malcolm, what are you doing?
"Look at me I'm the best player of bowling

183
00:15:55,807 -> 00:15:59,975
I worry a lot about the bowling!
Bowling is so important!

184
00:16:00,474 -> 00:16:02,167
Malcolm back here!

185
00:16:02,717 -> 00:16:04,811
Do you want a strike?
I'll give you a strike!

186
00:16:05,287 -> 00:16:06,512
Here's your damn strike!

187
00:16:20,770 -> 00:16:23,540
Way to go Connie

188
00:16:25,317 -> 00:16:26,615
Listen, maybe you should not ...

189
00:16:26,933 -> 00:16:29,489
Connie! Connie! Connie!

190
00:16:29,785 -> 00:16:32,881
Connie! Connie! Connie!

191
00:16:33,223 -> 00:16:35,417
This is a classic
Let's kiss!

192
00:16:35,943 -> 00:16:37,069
I think not

193
00:16:37,506 -> 00:16:41,442
Connie! Connie! Connie!

194
00:16:41,711 -> 00:16:43,433
Listen I think the bowling is over

195
00:16:43,898 -> 00:16:46,212
Take their coats, take everyone home

196
00:16:49,761 -> 00:16:51,100
Returns shoes

197
00:16:52,692 -> 00:16:54,181
See you outside

198
00:17:04,414 -> 00:17:06,646
"You see there's nobody here
- Yes!

199
00:17:10,091 -> 00:17:11,852
Hey, think you're very cute

200
00:17:12,444 -> 00:17:14,737
Thanks you are cute too.

201
00:17:18,739 -> 00:17:19,792
Just one more

202
00:17:30,039 -> 00:17:33,082
Okay. I will dare,
I will totally kiss

203
00:17:59,415 -> 00:18:00,785
That counts right?

204
00:18:08,052 -> 00:18:09,507
Three, zero, zero

205
00:18:09,507 -> 00:18:15,879
Three, zero, zero

206
00:18:20,537 -> 00:18:23,646
What happens?
You have not made a noise just over an hour.

207
00:18:24,192 -> 00:18:25,097
I'm a little tired

208
00:18:26,029 -> 00:18:28,817
But you have not tried your flight false
and your zonambulismo.

209
00:18:29,597 -> 00:18:31,518
Never give up so easily

210
00:18:33,130 -> 00:18:36,863
Maybe you learned your tricks
do not take you anywhere.

211
00:18:37,269 -> 00:18:38,445
I think

212
00:18:38,445 -> 00:18:42,925
When you have learned here the sentence is served
do not walk with little games.

213
00:18:45,100 -> 00:18:49,520
Well I see you've had enough
20 minutes of television can not hurt.

214
00:18:50,319 -> 00:18:52,348
"Well
"One moment

215
00:18:52,738 -> 00:18:57,533
Unless a new trick
Back to that bed boy

216
00:18:57,943 -> 00:18:59,174
Okay

217
00:19:00,130 -> 00:19:03,768
No, no, I hold are exaggerated
Go watch TV

218
00:19:05,333 -> 00:19:07,722
Wait not so fast

219
00:19:08,597 -> 00:19:10,553
I will not fall again

220
00:19:11,321 -> 00:19:14,476
Oh, I say I'm ridiculous
but do not get away with it.

221
00:19:14,992 -> 00:19:16,631
Come see TV
hopes not, stay where you are.

222
00:19:18,740 -> 00:19:22,737
Agree, agree .. we'll tell you
going to watch TV ...

223
00:19:22,984 -> 00:19:27,451
... But it will not be a channel that you enjoy ...
telenovelas, that will suffice.

224
00:19:30,734 -> 00:19:33,718
- Who do you think won?
I'm not sure

225
00:19:36,581 -> 00:19:40,094
Hey Mom I have something to say
at first I convinced you to stay ...

226
00:19:40,491 -> 00:19:43,455
... But in the end, well tonight was magical.

227
00:19:49,299 -> 00:19:51,489
"Hello
- What? Want to make fun of me too?

228
00:19:51,782 -> 00:19:56,375
No, I just wanted to tell you that was very brave of you to confront your mother

229
00:19:58,115 -> 00:20:03,379
And I think that was so funny that you throw
pine one being a few inches.

230
00:20:03,882 -> 00:20:04,943
Do you have other comments?

231
00:20:06,021 -> 00:20:08,490
No. Would you kiss me?

232
00:20:08,759 -> 00:20:10,687
What?
Think you can come to mock me and.

233
00:13:27,587 -> 00:13:30,411
I can not believe your parents
'll leave you alone on your birthday.

234
00:20:18,137 -> 00:20:22,011
Okay, that's it!
"Oh you can not be worse than your father.

235
00:20:22,886 -> 00:20:24,891
Separate sit in the car

236
00:20:26,652 -> 00:20:30,808
I know it's pure envy so I will not have
but you and I know that this was a perfect game.

237
00:20:37,196 -> 00:20:38,686
Reese salt machine photos

238
00:20:44,262 -> 00:20:46,719
Hi, you probably want to use the car right?
I better go ..

239
00:21:29,137 -> 00:21:30,449
And how did it go?

240
00:21:30,823 -> 00:21:32,668
