1
00:00:02,847 -> 00:00:03,693
Vamos!

2
00:00:04,115 -> 00:00:05,741
They said I could play

3
00:00:13,269 -> 00:00:14,568
You have to download again

4
00:00:14,862 -> 00:00:15,443
No

5
00:00:15,818 -> 00:00:17,442
Vamos! You're the only one coming

6
00:00:17,664 -> 00:00:18,366
No

7
00:00:18,740 -> 00:00:21,104
Always on and never let me play

8
00:00:21,627 -> 00:00:22,567
We'll let you play

9
00:00:23,002 -> 00:00:23,629
It's a promise

10
00:00:28,660 -> 00:00:29,262
Vamos!

11
00:00:29,551 -> 00:00:31,560
Around here, they promised

12
00:00:31,976 -> 00:00:32,747
No

13
00:00:33,276 -> 00:00:34,087
Promised

14
00:00:34,087 -> 00:00:37,072
The first 50 times he was funny
then was sad.

15
00:00:38,053 -> 00:00:40,489
It is not fair, it's my turn.

16
00:00:40,910 -> 00:00:42,301
It is funny again

17
00:01:19,672 -> 00:01:23,014
Francis dad back to school tomorrow
Can we not see what he wants?

18
00:01:23,342 -> 00:01:27,552
This is educational
Is a celebration of human spirit

19
00:01:28,152 -> 00:01:31,403
Shows a way to keep
though we are defeated.

20
00:01:33,013 -> 00:01:34,950
No, do not use the rocket skates.

21
00:01:35,807 -> 00:01:37,326
Hal, are you coming to my room?

22
00:01:37,326 -> 00:01:38,387
Yes, if a second is ...

23
00:01:38,607 -> 00:01:39,215
Hal!

24
00:01:44,879 -> 00:01:45,803
Okay, who did what?

25
00:01:46,270 -> 00:01:47,692
You did, I have two weeks late

26
00:01:50,080 -> 00:01:50,664
What?

27
00:01:51,176 -> 00:01:51,577
No!

28
00:01:51,797 -> 00:01:52,194
If

29
00:01:52,562 -> 00:01:57,236
No, no, you can be, can not be
We have been careful.

30
00:01:58,155 -> 00:01:59,163
How do you let that happen?

31
00:01:59,438 -> 00:02:01,421
Which as I leave
this happen?

32
00:02:01,687 -> 00:02:02,773
You're kidding right?

33
00:02:03,084 -> 00:02:04,609
Just say, you are the woman.

34
00:02:05,234 -> 00:02:06,797
What's that supposed to mean?

35
00:02:07,096 -> 00:02:09,062
You know I'm not reliable in those things

36
00:02:10,333 -> 00:02:11,736
You're the keeper

37
00:02:12,422 -> 00:02:14,812
That's the dumbest thing you've said in your life.

38
00:02:15,022 -> 00:02:15,734
Not even close!

39
00:02:16,421 -> 00:02:17,985
How much are you making me a soda, Dewey?

40
00:02:18,611 -> 00:02:19,690
Mom and dad are fighting

41
00:02:19,762 -> 00:02:20,397
Really?

42
00:02:21,697 -> 00:02:23,599
Do not be afraid boy, everything will be fine.

43
00:02:23,731 -> 00:02:24,512
Believe me

44
00:02:25,936 -> 00:02:27,200
Do you know that distract you from that?

45
00:02:27,984 -> 00:02:29,247
Prepare a sandwich

46
00:02:30,411 -> 00:02:32,294
Sorry, this is just disgusting.

47
00:02:32,535 -> 00:02:33,873
It is disgusting to me too.

48
00:02:34,483 -> 00:02:35,968
Can not be pregnant

49
00:02:36,660 -> 00:02:37,651
We are not ready for this

50
00:02:37,959 -> 00:02:39,637
And when we were ready for this, Hal?

51
00:02:46,161 -> 00:02:46,935
Okay, go ahead

52
00:02:47,762 -> 00:02:50,825
The holy bond of marriage is a sacred act

53
00:02:53,122 -> 00:02:54,138
Maybe we should take to hospital

54
00:02:54,373 -> 00:02:54,859
No

55
00:02:55,340 -> 00:02:57,769
I will not give birth to our baby out of wedlock.

56
00:02:58,357 -> 00:03:00,784
Do not understand why suddenly
you're so obsessed with this

57
00:03:01,434 -> 00:03:04,047
A week ago the certificate
marriage was just a paper

58
00:03:06,537 -> 00:03:08,272
Change of opinion

59
00:03:09,845 -> 00:03:12,084
Yes, and made me the happiest man in the world.

60
00:03:16,103 -> 00:03:17,330
Welcome home, Francis.

61
00:03:18,321 -> 00:03:19,628
This place is beautiful!

62
00:03:19,870 -> 00:03:25,078
Oh thanks I can not accept all the credit
the decorator did it but .. here it is. Save the change.

63
00:03:25,790 -> 00:03:27,666
A second ...
a second ...

64
00:03:28,767 -> 00:03:31,576
Oh almost forgot ... with so much emotion.

65
00:03:33,291 -> 00:03:34,567
Here are a cigar is Cuban

66
00:03:34,593 -> 00:03:35,203
Thanks

67
00:03:35,165 -> 00:03:35,922
Nothing

68
00:03:44,555 -> 00:03:46,258
Hal have a baby

69
00:03:46,619 -> 00:03:47,408
Yes, we do.

70
00:03:52,667 -> 00:03:53,518
Baby

71
00:03:56,806 -> 00:04:00,478
Baby, baby

72
00:04:00,707 -> 00:04:03,119
It's beautiful, we are lucky is not hal?

73
00:04:03,884 -> 00:04:04,614
Yes, luck

74
00:04:05,443 -> 00:04:06,454
Do you think we'll be good parents?

75
00:04:06,690 -> 00:04:07,605
You're kidding, the best

76
00:04:08,097 -> 00:04:09,455
Do you think that will change our relationship?

77
00:04:09,759 -> 00:04:10,446
"Our what ..?

78
00:04:10,768 -> 00:04:12,033
No, no!

79
00:04:12,518 -> 00:04:13,798
Because now we get along

80
00:04:14,128 -> 00:04:16,818
And everybody says that a baby changes everything

81
00:04:18,784 -> 00:04:20,082
I have to feed

82
00:04:20,808 -> 00:04:21,382
Why?

83
00:04:21,881 -> 00:04:23,643
We have to watch their weight

84
00:04:24,035 -> 00:04:26,291
Hal, the nurse said that
fed every four hours.

85
00:04:26,579 -> 00:04:28,317
Yeah, well, you saw the appearance
the nurse.

86
00:04:30,055 -> 00:04:32,144
Hal .. where's the baby?

87
00:04:32,645 -> 00:04:35,240
I do not know how to say exactly but
I think the baby is ...

88
00:04:36,605 -> 00:04:37,457
... In the closet.

89
00:04:38,426 -> 00:04:39,216
Yes!

90
00:04:41,679 -> 00:04:42,429
Here it is!

91
00:04:43,821 -> 00:04:44,691
Perfectly safe.

92
00:04:45,096 -> 00:04:46,716
"Baby got involved in the closet?

93
00:04:47,411 -> 00:04:49,355
So what? You left the milk on the shelf.

94
00:04:51,817 -> 00:04:53,354
Come, my love.

95
00:04:57,678 -> 00:04:59,817
I never turn away from me again

96
00:05:01,957 -> 00:05:03,254
Hey Mom's OK if I take ..

97
00:05:03,527 -> 00:05:04,631
Get out!

98
00:05:05,753 -> 00:05:09,128
You had to blame for using
pants that are broken knee

99
00:05:09,395 -> 00:05:13,958
Hal Oh, if you throw everything you would walk soaked exita
with a napkin and a baseball cap.

100
00:05:15,582 -> 00:05:16,269
Basta!

101
00:05:16,792 -> 00:05:17,879
What you want from me?

102
00:05:18,192 -> 00:05:19,025
I'm just a human

103
00:05:19,025 -> 00:05:24,038
Oh please hal as you enter the room you become more beast than man.

104
00:05:24,815 -> 00:05:26,318
Well, then all my fault

105
00:05:26,568 -> 00:05:29,395
Yes, great here comes the rain!

106
00:05:31,739 -> 00:05:32,644
Mosquito stupid

107
00:05:33,166 -> 00:05:34,354
What happens to Mom and Dad?

108
00:05:34,778 -> 00:05:37,240
Oh, just wait .. in an hour
will be kissing

109
00:05:37,677 -> 00:05:38,366
It's unpleasant

110
00:05:40,807 -> 00:05:41,791
Mosquito stupid

111
00:05:46,056 -> 00:05:46,755
Stupid!

112
00:05:52,586 -> 00:05:54,006
Oh, God give me a break Reese!

113
00:05:55,193 -> 00:05:56,753
Ready Francis is fast asleep

114
00:05:57,770 -> 00:06:00,191
Empty the dishwasher
and loaded the dishwasher.

115
00:06:00,692 -> 00:06:03,706
I had no time to remove the pudding
Your hair dryer, maybe tomorrow.

116
00:06:04,818 -> 00:06:05,333
Adios

117
00:06:11,041 -> 00:06:11,694
What time you're at home?

118
00:06:11,694 -> 00:06:13,616
I do not know .. 5 ... 6 ... 9

119
00:06:14,065 -> 00:06:15,128
Did you say 9?

120
00:06:15,675 -> 00:06:19,940
Honey I can not cancel another engagement
I have to go eat, I have to catch up.

121
00:06:19,940 -> 00:06:22,674
Hal this is ridiculous,
work 14 hour shifts.

122
00:06:23,463 -> 00:06:25,103
This baby hits kills me from within

123
00:06:25,103 -> 00:06:27,018
And Francis is out of control

124
00:06:27,353 -> 00:06:29,041
Something has to change

125
00:06:29,402 -> 00:06:30,591
This also will talk with my boss.

126
00:06:30,927 -> 00:06:31,852
Yeah, I said before.

127
00:06:32,052 -> 00:06:37,005
Yes, and then it I fell from the sky and
was not a good time, now is better.

128
00:06:37,926 -> 00:06:39,066
Okay?
I love you

129
00:06:48,839 -> 00:06:52,628
Martin have been leading sales is
Company 5 years in a row.

130
00:06:52,840 -> 00:06:54,341
No one has succeeded in overcoming

131
00:06:54,816 -> 00:06:58,894
Just do my hours cut
a bit just to help around the house.

132
00:06:59,880 -> 00:07:01,081
You understand, you have kids.

133
00:07:01,456 -> 00:07:02,753
Absolutely, hal

134
00:07:03,289 -> 00:07:05,568
Do not worry, I'll find the way
to which I work.

135
00:07:09,417 -> 00:07:09,941
Hi hal!

136
00:07:10,652 -> 00:07:11,568
Hi Bil

137
00:07:20,504 -> 00:07:22,582
Hal supplies ..!

138
00:07:24,485 -> 00:07:25,150
What?

139
00:07:25,602 -> 00:07:28,721
I trained in that subject
I gave half my agenda

140
00:07:29,239 -> 00:07:30,626
And do you know why I said this morning?

141
00:07:31,113 -> 00:07:35,664
Need more cargo
and not even need my burden

142
00:07:36,315 -> 00:07:37,378
God!

143
00:07:37,806 -> 00:07:38,492
"Another contraction?

144
00:07:38,757 -> 00:07:40,968
No, kicking me between contractions

145
00:07:41,181 -> 00:07:42,446
"What happens to this child?!

146
00:07:43,135 -> 00:07:44,365
Are you having fun go?

147
00:07:45,882 -> 00:07:47,697
Okay, let's take a look at the oven.

148
00:07:49,100 -> 00:07:51,407
God! How much will I need?

149
00:07:51,728 -> 00:07:53,586
Because I swear I'll kick the kidneys

150
00:07:54,007 -> 00:07:57,107
There are 2 centimeters dilated
I would say 4 to 5 hours at least.

151
00:07:58,359 -> 00:07:59,281
No!

152
00:07:59,743 -> 00:08:00,921
Heaven, the doctor said .. NO!

153
00:08:00,921 -> 00:08:05,245
Going to leave now, I'm sick of this.
Going out now sir.

154
00:08:10,932 -> 00:08:11,729
What are you doing?

155
00:08:12,508 -> 00:08:13,531
Not the time to push

156
00:08:14,147 -> 00:08:15,668
Only going to prolong your labor

157
00:08:16,132 -> 00:08:17,866
Great, it became a challenge.

158
00:08:19,397 -> 00:08:21,419
Lady's only going to run out

159
00:08:21,634 -> 00:08:24,591
And when it's time to bid
really be exhausted.

160
00:08:25,838 -> 00:08:28,194
Look can I just say
force all you want.

161
00:08:28,463 -> 00:08:29,294
But it will not a. ..

162
00:08:30,821 -> 00:08:32,024
Oh god, nurse

163
00:08:34,135 -> 00:08:36,009
Going great, going great
Do not forget to breathe

164
00:08:37,822 -> 00:08:40,244
Do you think we're ready
for a second child?

165
00:08:40,929 -> 00:08:43,070
We have twice as many children and half the money

166
00:08:43,508 -> 00:08:45,043
What will happen to us?

167
00:08:45,509 -> 00:08:47,840
Well, well ... find a way

168
00:08:48,233 -> 00:08:49,492
You know, we love.

169
00:08:50,132 -> 00:08:52,007
We will adjust and
mucho.

170
00:08:52,697 -> 00:08:53,570
Children alone are

171
00:08:54,347 -> 00:08:54,729
Yes!

172
00:08:54,729 -> 00:08:56,135
And here it comes ... AH!

173
00:08:57,609 -> 00:08:59,777
By god, I kicked the nose

174
00:09:02,283 -> 00:09:03,029
While Esters

175
00:09:08,888 -> 00:09:09,888
Pregnancy test

176
00:09:10,335 -> 00:09:11,386
What took you so long?

177
00:09:11,728 -> 00:09:13,840
Wanted to go to the supermarket
where you work.

178
00:09:14,228 -> 00:09:15,789
Were the other side of town

179
00:09:15,789 -> 00:09:17,930
Yes, if you want to give you the path
Do you want details too?

180
00:09:19,218 -> 00:09:19,893
Open up!

181
00:09:20,189 -> 00:09:20,745
Busy!

182
00:09:22,294 -> 00:09:22,928
Garden!

183
00:09:23,391 -> 00:09:24,343
Lost your head?

184
00:09:24,614 -> 00:09:26,764
Come and let you choose the tree.

185
00:09:30,953 -> 00:09:32,320
Mom and Dad are getting divorced?

186
00:09:33,004 -> 00:09:33,890
What are you talking about?

187
00:09:35,702 -> 00:09:37,218
Is that they are very angry

188
00:09:38,703 -> 00:09:40,017
Do not worry everything will be fine

189
00:09:40,377 -> 00:09:41,265
How do you know?

190
00:09:41,726 -> 00:09:45,423
Look, I'm also scared but
have a way to solve everything!

191
00:09:45,802 -> 00:09:46,367
How?

192
00:09:46,704 -> 00:09:47,735
I do not know, just do it.

193
00:09:48,392 -> 00:09:49,186
But how?

194
00:09:50,343 -> 00:09:51,550
How can I tell you so you understand?

195
00:09:52,164 -> 00:09:52,890
Shut up!

196
00:10:01,928 -> 00:10:05,740
Reese wants to bear!

197
00:10:06,928 -> 00:10:08,491
This is smaller than the department

198
00:10:09,045 -> 00:10:10,170
Remind me not to let

199
00:10:10,392 -> 00:10:11,656
What choice had Lois?

200
00:10:11,858 -> 00:10:13,290
If it is smaller ...
and cheap.

201
00:10:13,843 -> 00:10:15,453
The department was not
to educate children

202
00:10:15,691 -> 00:10:20,874
There was no more than museums, clubs
nightclubs and expensive restaurants.

203
00:10:22,577 -> 00:10:26,815
At least we have a garden to play right?
Ya want to get my hands dirty with this garden.

204
00:10:29,048 -> 00:10:30,640
Children, children's enough to play!

205
00:10:30,410 -> 00:10:31,448
It's time for Reese lesson

206
00:10:32,924 -> 00:10:33,912
What we see today son?

207
00:10:34,829 -> 00:10:38,335
Russian literature or we will soak
circulatory system

208
00:10:40,548 -> 00:10:42,508
If the circulatory system!

209
00:10:43,897 -> 00:10:46,938
If great. Ignores the pregnant woman
8 months which loads the boxes ..

210
00:10:48,838 -> 00:10:53,909
The Da vinci monalisa was
Marconi invented the radio

211
00:10:54,276 -> 00:10:56,636
9 is the product of 3x3

212
00:10:57,113 -> 00:10:59,361
Darwin says that we came from apes

213
00:11:00,010 -> 00:11:04,566
But not literally

214
00:11:04,862 -> 00:11:05,751
Hal want to stop!

215
00:11:06,112 -> 00:11:09,413
Lois have to do this 35 minutes
3 times a day.

216
00:11:09,799 -> 00:11:11,611
Reese just sits there.

217
00:11:11,611 -> 00:11:13,135
Lois is a thinker.

218
00:11:13,751 -> 00:11:16,486
It's a thinker
relentlessly focused

219
00:11:16,907 -> 00:11:18,259
Absorbs information

220
00:11:18,564 -> 00:11:22,784
Studies show that developing minds absorb information at a tremendous rate

221
00:11:23,072 -> 00:11:28,191
Hal is 2 years old, tells you your
do not know who want to help but is not Reese.

222
00:11:32,399 -> 00:11:33,984
God I hit the trigeminal nerve

223
00:11:35,313 -> 00:11:37,549
We were studying the nervous system
all morning

224
00:11:37,549 -> 00:11:41,174
Oh Hal Want to come back to reality
and help me unpack?

225
00:11:42,835 -> 00:11:47,656
Lois did you have crossed his mind what would be nice to support what I'm doing here?

226
00:11:47,860 -> 00:11:49,191
You know why that's a good question

227
00:11:49,735 -> 00:11:52,626
Do you know what you're doing here?
Because I tell you what you're doing ...

228
00:11:52,554 -> 00:11:53,314
... And that's help.

229
00:11:53,692 -> 00:11:54,615
I know that ..

230
00:11:57,441 -> 00:12:00,653
... I should go for a walk
before deciding something I'll regret

231
00:12:05,295 -> 00:12:06,643
Phone adios!

232
00:12:07,294 -> 00:12:08,966
Or not ... Honey

233
00:12:09,628 -> 00:12:15,106
Honey is good. Mom and Dad
just had a bad time

234
00:12:16,420 -> 00:12:17,581
The last months

235
00:12:18,204 -> 00:12:19,735
But do not Preo ... OUCH!

236
00:12:24,450 -> 00:12:25,455
No, not now!

237
00:12:27,610 -> 00:12:28,777
Hal!

238
00:12:30,449 -> 00:12:33,892
We'll give a little back and
Dad eventually find out where we are ...

239
00:12:33,892 -> 00:12:35,451
And we'll be together in the hospital

240
00:12:36,106 -> 00:12:38,079
I do not need to go to hospital

241
00:12:38,079 -> 00:12:39,253
No heaven for me

242
00:12:39,253 -> 00:12:41,061
You want me inject lying

243
00:12:41,263 -> 00:12:44,465
No, that was the last time and I apologized
Now get in the car!

244
00:12:44,857 -> 00:12:48,437
Mom is lying!

245
00:12:54,106 -> 00:12:55,732
Francis opened the door

246
00:12:56,916 -> 00:12:57,900
Open the door right now

247
00:12:58,524 -> 00:13:00,918
You're lying and you run out

248
00:13:01,149 -> 00:13:03,062
Francis please mommy has to go to hospital

249
00:13:03,634 -> 00:13:04,868
Say you're sorry

250
00:13:05,186 -> 00:13:05,839
Open the door!

251
00:13:06,212 -> 00:13:07,697
Say that you popo

252
00:13:08,463 -> 00:13:09,934
I will not say I'm popo

253
00:13:09,934 -> 00:13:11,329
Open that door!

254
00:13:14,087 -> 00:13:15,479
I'm having a baby!

255
00:13:15,950 -> 00:13:16,937
Congratulations

256
00:13:30,215 -> 00:13:30,668
What happens?

257
00:13:30,922 -> 00:13:32,386
His wife gave birth in the garden

258
00:13:33,424 -> 00:13:34,753
Congratulations, I guess.

259
00:13:35,123 -> 00:13:36,062
Oh god!

260
00:13:36,399 -> 00:13:37,202
Mira

261
00:13:37,759 -> 00:13:39,189
Lois is a ..

262
00:13:39,821 -> 00:13:42,188
... A baby ...

263
00:13:44,715 -> 00:13:45,652
Want my straw?

264
00:13:46,305 -> 00:13:47,527
Hal leave me alone.

265
00:13:49,753 -> 00:13:50,527
Need Help?

266
00:13:50,887 -> 00:13:51,904
Hal leave me alone.

267
00:13:52,874 -> 00:13:53,652
Take this

268
00:13:54,142 -> 00:13:55,924
You could not buy a minute's takes 5

269
00:13:56,560 -> 00:13:58,562
4 minutes we'll be together dear

270
00:13:58,810 -> 00:13:59,809
Do not use that tone with me

271
00:14:00,403 -> 00:14:02,235
Sorry is the only tone that I have

272
00:14:02,715 -> 00:14:04,641
Is my tone of panic for the future

273
00:14:05,354 -> 00:14:07,753
We do not have enough money
Have you ever considered that?

274
00:14:08,019 -> 00:14:11,792
Hey enjoy both urinating in the
garden that I have not thought of anything

275
00:14:12,002 -> 00:14:14,230
Another good response that does not help much

276
00:14:14,488 -> 00:14:15,778
What did not help much?

277
00:14:16,292 -> 00:14:20,260
Let me say something Hal ...
why not take that test and you take in the ...

278
00:14:26,105 -> 00:14:31,951
Reese please just sit 5 minutes
I beg you. Play with this.

279
00:14:35,093 -> 00:14:37,279
Malcolm please raise your things

280
00:14:37,939 -> 00:14:40,289
Why a 4 year old child
plays with a microscope?

281
00:14:41,138 -> 00:14:43,055
I see that we still have moved the microwave

282
00:14:43,327 -> 00:14:47,823
As you've specified multiple times
this is the only outlet in the kitchen works

283
00:14:48,028 -> 00:14:50,767
Maybe we desenvolsar for
a luxurious extension cable

284
00:14:51,118 -> 00:14:55,602
Extension cords, but we are busy
by the enormous heat in the room ...

285
00:14:55,602 -> 00:14:57,148
... Because someone gives you cold

286
00:14:57,719 -> 00:15:00,140
Maybe you want to share a bed
with someone who is not cold

287
00:15:07,398 -> 00:15:08,057
Hi Lois

288
00:15:08,464 -> 00:15:09,679
Now what did this time?

289
00:15:10,000 -> 00:15:11,790
Fly will ride as a street sweeper

290
00:15:12,010 -> 00:15:12,705
Enter here

291
00:15:12,890 -> 00:15:13,545
Francis ..

292
00:15:13,996 -> 00:15:18,218
His citation ... his day in court
is 12 and knows the routine well ..

293
00:15:18,546 -> 00:15:19,446
Official Thanks

294
00:15:23,183 -> 00:15:25,150
Are you caught in a street sweeper?

295
00:15:25,150 -> 00:15:26,496
What were you thinking?

296
00:15:26,870 -> 00:15:28,180
I could go faster.

297
00:15:28,495 -> 00:15:29,370
Go to your room

298
00:15:30,182 -> 00:15:30,932
Are you already happy?

299
00:15:31,265 -> 00:15:31,906
Me?

300
00:15:32,134 -> 00:15:33,433
Now this is my fault?

301
00:15:33,251 -> 00:15:36,324
Whenever you tell the stories
in your wild youth

302
00:15:36,534 -> 00:15:38,450
These were cautionary tales

303
00:15:38,686 -> 00:15:41,434
The cautionary tales
not end with "was grandiose"

304
00:15:41,747 -> 00:15:44,689
Mom I think my game
chemistry is broken

305
00:15:44,689 -> 00:15:45,612
Malcolm In a second

306
00:15:45,596 -> 00:15:46,406
I ask a favor Lois

307
00:15:46,659 -> 00:15:52,611
Make me a list of childhood memories
to know what I can and I can not tell my children

308
00:15:55,490 -> 00:15:56,320
God ..

309
00:15:57,813 -> 00:16:00,275
Hal Take it that will not work
to the emergency room

310
00:16:00,275 -> 00:16:02,167
We do not need an emergency room

311
00:16:03,491 -> 00:16:06,482
Hal's going to undir more in your mouth
and you are going to suffocation

312
00:16:07,471 -> 00:16:10,390
For once you can stop me
I'm wrong

313
00:16:11,125 -> 00:16:12,749
And you want to stop telling me to do

314
00:16:15,532 -> 00:16:16,173
But ..

315
00:16:16,173 -> 00:16:19,999
Try to make invisible ink
but I think manufactured gas

316
00:16:20,752 -> 00:16:22,266
God, everyone outside

317
00:16:22,737 -> 00:16:24,048
Corran children

318
00:16:29,796 -> 00:16:30,798
Is everyone okay?

319
00:16:31,077 -> 00:16:31,985
Yes, we are well

320
00:16:33,439 -> 00:16:34,437
Let's wait for the house ...

321
00:16:37,396 -> 00:16:38,392
Rain!

322
00:16:43,923 -> 00:16:49,596
Oh yeah cool, let's hear it has
to be my fault somehow

323
00:16:49,875 -> 00:16:51,516
Go ahead, say it

324
00:16:51,811 -> 00:16:53,087
Say we

325
00:16:53,352 -> 00:16:56,392
I am the cause of all evil in the universe

326
00:16:56,718 -> 00:16:59,609
Everything I touch turn it into manure

327
00:17:00,437 -> 00:17:03,814
And now I bring you rain!

328
00:17:05,249 -> 00:17:08,999
I know you feel better when
Lois kicks him in, say it!

329
00:17:10,376 -> 00:17:12,235
I'll have the baby

330
00:17:19,366 -> 00:17:21,689
Well, that's good ..

331
00:17:22,423 -> 00:17:25,767
Because the car keys
are inside the house

332
00:17:26,187 -> 00:17:29,017
So I can suffocate
in if I find them

333
00:17:29,351 -> 00:17:31,595
Or you can have another
baby here in the garden

334
00:17:32,413 -> 00:17:34,628
So do you think maybe the flowers bloom!

335
00:17:49,771 -> 00:17:51,282
We can not do this!

336
00:17:52,609 -> 00:17:55,140
We will not have a baby if we continue like this ..

337
00:17:55,875 -> 00:17:58,537
We have to think of a
way to solve this

338
00:17:59,539 -> 00:18:00,765
I'll have to find another job y. ..

339
00:18:00,816 -> 00:18:03,738
No! We have to think
on how to work it out

340
00:18:05,095 -> 00:18:08,332
I'm not talking now because
always have bad times

341
00:18:08,971 -> 00:18:11,942
We have to think about how out of this
killing unfinished

342
00:18:12,209 -> 00:18:13,714
Well I'm open to suggestions ...

343
00:18:18,220 -> 00:18:23,711
Under this is what we do.
Vas say 3, not 5, not 7 ...

344
00:18:24,517 -> 00:18:28,222
I want to know 7
things that you love me

345
00:18:29,587 -> 00:18:32,392
7 reasons why it is worth

346
00:18:32,737 -> 00:18:34,581
7 reasons why we are here

347
00:18:37,635 -> 00:18:38,547
"7?
7!

348
00:18:39,094 -> 00:18:42,188
And I have to believe it all
you must tell me now.

349
00:18:42,342 -> 00:18:42,960
"7?

350
00:18:43,238 -> 00:18:44,791
Please Hal, just do it

351
00:18:44,791 -> 00:18:46,069
Well, well ...

352
00:18:49,394 -> 00:18:52,135
I love your neck smells like morning

353
00:18:53,477 -> 00:18:54,981
Okay, this is a ...

354
00:18:58,431 -> 00:19:02,783
And I love all your toes
People look different

355
00:19:03,136 -> 00:19:03,907
What?

356
00:19:05,874 -> 00:19:11,996
I love that you are an honest and fearless and
I get sick when you treat me like a baby.

357
00:19:13,543 -> 00:19:16,745
The latter account for two
I only have three more.

358
00:19:21,361 -> 00:19:24,761
I can tell you that I have always adored this ...

359
00:19:26,021 -> 00:19:28,182
Wrinkle your forehead when you worry

360
00:19:30,146 -> 00:19:34,360
I love how you spend cutting edge of your pan
comiendotelos even end up anyway ..

361
00:19:35,396 -> 00:19:36,547
I love your loyalty

362
00:19:37,267 -> 00:19:38,435
And your tenderness

363
00:19:38,903 -> 00:19:42,285
And you're still sinking
stomach when I enter the room

364
00:19:43,956 -> 00:19:46,534
And I love when they rejected me
when you knew I loved you

365
00:19:47,409 -> 00:19:51,012
I love that you've married me yet
after meeting my parents

366
00:19:54,215 -> 00:19:55,769
And I love you more than anything in my life

367
00:19:56,920 -> 00:19:58,307
More than an argument with Dad

368
00:20:00,234 -> 00:20:01,917
Or a new album Van Hellen

369
00:20:02,884 -> 00:20:04,885
Or an old album, all the same

370
00:20:05,496 -> 00:20:06,249
O solo discs

371
00:20:06,249 -> 00:20:07,060
Hal!

372
00:20:08,289 -> 00:20:12,352
I love that about my life is complete
to share it with you

373
00:20:28,298 -> 00:20:34,048
And I love that you send the kids to their room
just to have some time alone ...

374
00:20:34,821 -> 00:20:35,925
And I just I love you

375
00:20:42,763 -> 00:20:43,359
It is my sandwich!

376
00:20:57,634 -> 00:20:59,484
You know I would not change any of them

377
00:21:00,674 -> 00:21:02,758
They are our children
nobody else can say that

378
00:21:04,122 -> 00:21:05,074
Our boys

379
00:21:06,922 -> 00:21:07,902
Negative!

380
00:21:08,250 -> 00:21:09,652
Do not worry about anything

381
00:21:11,188 -> 00:21:12,923
Although it would have been nice

382
00:21:13,587 -> 00:21:16,695
You say we are 5 against
and we still dominate

383
00:21:31,383 -> 00:21:33,353
Boys! Go to your room!
