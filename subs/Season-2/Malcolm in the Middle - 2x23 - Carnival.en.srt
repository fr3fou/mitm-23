1
00:00:36,768 -> 00:00:37,746
I'm late for work

2
00:00:47,438 -> 00:00:50,832
When the television, you are privileged to have been removed
you have to do something to entertain.

3
00:00:51,098 -> 00:00:52,528
This is totally a change

4
00:01:28,882 -> 00:01:31,048
Well, two mysteries solved

5
00:01:31,252 -> 00:01:35,612
Because the toaster was stinking
and where Dewey left goldfish.

6
00:01:35,859 -> 00:01:37,991
Hal, could you wear a decent shirt?
Steve is here.

7
00:01:39,328 -> 00:01:39,875
So?

8
00:01:39,875 -> 00:01:41,409
And I like him here.

9
00:01:42,036 -> 00:01:45,141
Look, to put the children to read the newspaper.

10
00:01:46,432 -> 00:01:48,421
Wait. I have not finished yet

11
00:01:50,160 -> 00:01:51,539
Lingerie Sale

12
00:01:53,834 -> 00:01:55,885
Hey check, the county fair.

13
00:01:56,503 -> 00:01:59,427
Look at that, they have roller coasters,
phenomena, knife throwers.

14
00:02:00,097 -> 00:02:03,660
Written in your name .. ... rice

15
00:02:04,199 -> 00:02:07,349
Oh man, this is the last weekend
gotta go.

16
00:02:07,800 -> 00:02:09,270
If, as if Mom would let us go

17
00:02:10,255 -> 00:02:14,134
Why it .. must ... know?

18
00:02:15,818 -> 00:02:16,585
Do you have an idea?

19
00:02:18,726 -> 00:02:24,007
Maybe ... if you ... .. stay asleep.

20
00:02:24,446 -> 00:02:25,946
Your parents will not let us go to the fair.

21
00:02:26,474 -> 00:02:32,371
Think I'm sleeping in your house

22
00:02:33,211 -> 00:02:34,254
Double alibi

23
00:02:34,694 -> 00:02:35,979
It's a classic for a reason.

24
00:02:37,070 -> 00:02:41,695
Can you talk to your mom about staying the night?

25
00:02:42,117 -> 00:02:43,606
Mom, can we sleep in tonight Stevie?

26
00:02:43,606 -> 00:02:44,057
Clear

27
00:02:46,460 -> 00:02:48,833
Now my parents

28
00:02:49,459 -> 00:02:52,723
Sleeping Out?
Does someone else's home?

29
00:02:54,083 -> 00:02:55,792
Would not you like to sleep here, son?

30
00:02:56,177 -> 00:02:57,612
I do not think this is a good idea, Steve

31
00:02:57,612 -> 00:03:00,278
Malcolm's family has no air purifier

32
00:03:00,506 -> 00:03:02,934
And God know how
modern alarm systems have.

33
00:03:03,290 -> 00:03:05,184
They probably even
have no motion detectors.

34
00:03:05,427 -> 00:03:07,605
Be honest, son.
Are my snoring?

35
00:03:08,255 -> 00:03:11,044
You have a hypoallergenic mattress
perfectly good here.

36
00:03:11,548 -> 00:03:13,192
Just do not see the point.

37
00:03:14,224 -> 00:03:20,312
Help me feel normal.

38
00:03:25,538 -> 00:03:27,411
Calleron round

39
00:03:28,602 -> 00:03:29,375
Well, see you there.

40
00:03:29,873 -> 00:03:30,710
Steve did it.

41
00:03:30,710 -> 00:03:33,037
We find him at the bus stop half an hour

42
00:03:33,037 -> 00:03:37,238
Do not take the express 37 to the fair, have fun a little while and go home at midnight.

43
00:03:45,327 -> 00:03:46,199
Your little worm

44
00:03:46,199 -> 00:03:46,993
Let me

45
00:03:46,993 -> 00:03:47,762
What did you hear?

46
00:03:48,120 -> 00:03:49,868
Everything. I want to go to the fair.

47
00:03:49,868 -> 00:03:51,742
Dewey No, you're too small.

48
00:03:52,448 -> 00:03:54,335
Take me or I'll tell mom.

49
00:03:55,274 -> 00:03:57,819
If you do, I'll stomp.

50
00:03:58,183 -> 00:03:59,587
Go ahead, tell him yet

51
00:04:00,055 -> 00:04:02,399
Dewey, you're not going to go and you will not tell.

52
00:04:03,120 -> 00:04:08,693
If you talk to mom, gripping each pet
dejeremos you have and the free.

53
00:04:09,283 -> 00:04:14,949
Destroy every toy, every game, everything you love.

54
00:04:16,538 -> 00:04:17,727
Do what you do.

55
00:04:19,633 -> 00:04:20,992
Dewey will go with us to Steve.

56
00:04:20,992 -> 00:04:21,695
Why?

57
00:04:22,573 -> 00:04:23,539
Because we want

58
00:04:23,929 -> 00:04:25,244
And it's fun

59
00:04:26,037 -> 00:04:27,590
What Steve's mom agree with that?

60
00:04:27,901 -> 00:04:28,465
If

61
00:04:28,759 -> 00:04:31,288
Maybe, but she has no idea
what is messing with you 3 there.

62
00:04:31,977 -> 00:04:32,573
Should call

63
00:04:32,807 -> 00:04:33,902
Honey, Kitty can speak for itself.

64
00:04:34,745 -> 00:04:37,791
She has made a decision and I think
would not have to contradict.

65
00:04:38,070 -> 00:04:38,649
What?

66
00:04:38,850 -> 00:04:43,354
Oh, if Dewey is also going to try
think of something to do alone.

67
00:04:46,035 -> 00:04:46,988
Okay guys, have fun.

68
00:04:48,448 -> 00:04:48,973
Adios

69
00:04:58,103 -> 00:04:59,992
Oh Hal, we got all night.

70
00:05:00,212 -> 00:05:01,914
Take it heats the roles.

71
00:05:13,166 -> 00:05:16,508
Oh dad would kill me if I
caught with one of the employees.

72
00:05:22,622 -> 00:05:23,307
Let the sound machine

73
00:05:26,917 -> 00:05:27,807
Hello, is Francis.

74
00:05:28,655 -> 00:05:29,916
Mom, Dad .. attend.

75
00:05:31,133 -> 00:05:34,809
I'm in the emergency room doctors
think they can save my leg when they ..

76
00:05:35,196 -> 00:05:36,507
Francis, are you okay?

77
00:05:36,933 -> 00:05:40,622
Ha! Avoiding your own children,
that good parents are.

78
00:05:40,854 -> 00:05:41,529
Honey, did something wrong?

79
00:05:41,921 -> 00:05:45,266
The fact that I have to resort to lies to get me to talk. That is wrong.

80
00:05:45,641 -> 00:05:46,440
What is it, Francis?

81
00:05:46,826 -> 00:05:49,330
I do not know, it's Saturday night.
I thought I could call and say hello.

82
00:05:49,589 -> 00:05:51,393
Can we call you later?
Dad and I are a little busy now.

83
00:05:51,930 -> 00:05:53,048
Okay, let me talk to my brothers

84
00:05:53,339 -> 00:05:53,977
They are not here.

85
00:05:54,711 -> 00:05:57,589
So what are ... ow

86
00:06:14,181 -> 00:06:15,278
Where are you going everyone?

87
00:06:17,182 -> 00:06:19,526
Are going. This place is closing in 15 minutes.

88
00:06:19,977 -> 00:06:23,091
We would have arrived 2 hours ago
if we had not lowered the bus

89
00:06:23,432 -> 00:06:24,462
I have to pee

90
00:06:24,854 -> 00:06:28,703
And it cost us 2 hours.
Just so you will not see a Siamese pigs.

91
00:06:29,296 -> 00:06:29,901
No!

92
00:06:30,528 -> 00:06:35,417
Can we stop fighting and start living!?

93
00:06:36,369 -> 00:06:38,533
Ok, we only have time for a game
worthwhile.

94
00:06:39,112 -> 00:06:40,244
What camera terror?

95
00:06:40,870 -> 00:06:42,154
On the other side halfway

96
00:06:50,611 -> 00:06:51,598
Close game.

97
00:06:52,176 -> 00:06:54,428
What
We still have 5 minutes.

98
00:06:55,177 -> 00:06:56,423
Not according to my watch.

99
00:06:56,971 -> 00:06:58,692
Hey! You have to let ourselves go.

100
00:06:59,044 -> 00:07:01,542
This is the county fair.
This belongs to the people.

101
00:07:01,900 -> 00:07:03,832
I want to pay taxes then.

102
00:07:04,305 -> 00:07:07,912
Police. The only one call if you do not get out of here. Is closed.

103
00:07:11,793 -> 00:07:12,601
This sucks.

104
00:07:13,044 -> 00:07:15,671
He just messes with us because we
children and can not do anything about it.

105
00:07:15,671 -> 00:07:16,992
I know, this is unfair.

106
00:07:18,055 -> 00:07:20,891
He could let us pass. But
only has an attitude problem.

107
00:07:21,679 -> 00:07:23,672
What happened to customer service?

108
00:07:24,960 -> 00:07:26,357
Are you sure we should do this?

109
00:07:27,053 -> 00:07:29,086
Steve might get angry
viniendolo we only see.

110
00:07:29,319 -> 00:07:31,165
We're not doing anything wrong.
We are your parents

111
00:07:31,400 -> 00:07:33,266
And results will be in the neighborhood.

112
00:07:35,088 -> 00:07:36,381
You just want to kiss her goodnight.

113
00:07:36,837 -> 00:07:37,869
And what if so?

114
00:07:38,149 -> 00:07:40,884
I gave the kiss of good
nights that child since he was born.

115
00:07:41,136 -> 00:07:43,544
That makes me sleep better and sleep better.

116
00:07:46,366 -> 00:07:48,200
What takes so long?

117
00:07:49,213 -> 00:07:53,492
They are boys. Are probably looking
ninjas movies and eating cookies.

118
00:07:55,672 -> 00:07:58,766
Hello! Is everything okay in there?

119
00:07:59,923 -> 00:08:02,612
We can not pretend that we are here. They did not see us but probably heard noises.

120
00:08:03,938 -> 00:08:08,752
Oh Kitty, Abe What are you doing here?

121
00:08:08,752 -> 00:08:10,033
Hello Hal!

122
00:08:10,033 -> 00:08:12,282
Is everything okay? We heard a noise.

123
00:08:12,564 -> 00:08:15,940
Yeah, sure. We are moving furniture.

124
00:08:16,534 -> 00:08:17,600
What brings you here?

125
00:08:17,600 -> 00:08:19,129
We only came to see Steve.

126
00:08:19,848 -> 00:08:20,549
Steve?

127
00:08:21,190 -> 00:08:23,596
Steve is not here.
I thought he was with you.

128
00:08:24,286 -> 00:08:26,549
What are you talking about?
Where is my baby?

129
00:08:27,178 -> 00:08:29,267
Abe, Kitty. What are you doing here?

130
00:08:29,549 -> 00:08:32,788
We came to see Steve.
"He is not here in a Catch me with your kids?

131
00:08:33,172 -> 00:08:36,269
No, they told us they would
night at home in a Catch me.

132
00:08:41,151 -> 00:08:43,740
Hal brings my bra.

133
00:08:48,440 -> 00:08:50,161
I guess I should be
scared, but I'm not.

134
00:08:55,354 -> 00:08:56,011
Fake Blood

135
00:08:56,630 -> 00:08:58,172
Is that a Zombie?

136
00:08:59,082 -> 00:09:00,036
Tire casings

137
00:09:05,796 -> 00:09:13,962
Stevie, Stevie, Stevie, Stevie, Stevie, Stevie, Stevie ...

138
00:09:14,953 -> 00:09:19,256
Kitty have to leave space between
Stevies your answer or not hear.

139
00:09:19,256 -> 00:09:21,334
Sorry. I'm just a little nervous.

140
00:09:21,727 -> 00:09:24,883
I have little experience
with my son in mortal danger.

141
00:09:25,103 -> 00:09:29,820
Okay, just calm down. You have to focus on something positive like that so we will punish them.

142
00:09:30,136 -> 00:09:33,757
As in something when I can enforcable
Stevie is out alone and scared.

143
00:09:34,289 -> 00:09:35,663
I understand what you feel, Kitty.

144
00:09:35,663 -> 00:09:37,819
I'm worried too.
We are all worried.

145
00:09:38,102 -> 00:09:42,338
Abe, this truck is a palace.
How much do you leave?

146
00:09:42,338 -> 00:09:43,810
Not as much as you think.

147
00:09:44,039 -> 00:09:49,245
When I bought the DVD player and flat screen monitor gave us free GPS system ...

148
00:09:53,264 -> 00:09:57,123
Steve, Steve, Steve ..

149
00:09:57,637 -> 00:09:58,887
Where the hell is the exit?

150
00:09:59,337 -> 00:10:01,233
We were hanging around here for 20 minutes.

151
00:10:01,593 -> 00:10:03,105
This place is creepy

152
00:10:03,744 -> 00:10:05,495
Boys. We went back where we started.

153
00:10:05,775 -> 00:10:09,815
This is where we got the car.
I can feel the saliva of Dewey.

154
00:10:10,090 -> 00:10:13,294
Ok. I think we're out of options.
Let's make a bonfire.

155
00:10:14,249 -> 00:10:16,790
Just calm down. We must find
the way out of here.

156
00:10:17,041 -> 00:10:19,125
We need to stick together and hold hands.

157
00:10:19,028 -> 00:10:19,684
Resse give me your hand.

158
00:10:22,146 -> 00:10:23,459
I thought I was holding your hand.

159
00:10:34,327 -> 00:10:37,037
So start all
horror movies I've seen.

160
00:10:37,962 -> 00:10:39,303
I think we should separate.

161
00:10:44,787 -> 00:10:47,493
This place is like a graveyard
with a wheel of fortune.

162
00:10:47,820 -> 00:10:48,491
Are we in trouble?

163
00:10:48,886 -> 00:10:52,959
No, the last bus leaves in 20 minutes.
We just need to get out and wait.

164
00:10:54,046 -> 00:10:57,919
Hey ask him help

165
00:10:58,179 -> 00:11:01,005
No, we get into trouble.
Jumped the fence and get out of here.

166
00:11:01,005 -> 00:11:03,351
The grid measured as 12 feet tall.
What about Steve?

167
00:11:03,592 -> 00:11:04,616
We will in stages.

168
00:11:04,913 -> 00:11:07,852
Climb the chair and then
throw, do the same with Steve.

169
00:11:08,289 -> 00:11:09,147
Hello!

170
00:11:11,615 -> 00:11:12,215
The lost brother!

171
00:11:12,448 -> 00:11:12,914
Yes, go ahead

172
00:11:13,984 -> 00:11:18,469
Hi, sorry. But my brother was lost and
we get caught here after closing.

173
00:11:19,093 -> 00:11:23,599
You care to open the door and let us out.
We live only a few streets, it will give you more problems.

174
00:11:25,951 -> 00:11:27,636
Do you think the rules do not apply?

175
00:11:28,107 -> 00:11:28,930
Excuse me?

176
00:11:29,493 -> 00:11:31,712
######

177
00:11:35,900 -> 00:11:36,568
Is he mad?

178
00:11:36,919 -> 00:11:38,458
I dunno, looks a bit ...

179
00:11:49,649 -> 00:11:53,398
My God, window defrosters.
I've never seen that before.

180
00:11:53,725 -> 00:11:54,243
Hello!

181
00:11:54,243 -> 00:11:57,198
Francis!? Wait, I'll put on the speaker.

182
00:11:59,899 -> 00:12:00,400
Who is it?

183
00:12:00,608 -> 00:12:02,024
Francis, is Mom.
We need to talk.

184
00:12:02,453 -> 00:12:05,868
You know, with the images I have in my brain
I think the best thing for me right now ...

185
00:12:05,868 -> 00:12:08,868
... Is a short distance and
15 hours of public television.

186
00:12:09,131 -> 00:12:11,818
Francis, you could let the antics.
The boys are lost.

187
00:12:12,187 -> 00:12:12,837
What are you talking about?

188
00:12:13,184 -> 00:12:16,293
We are all hoping that you can help us by giving us some ideas of where to find them.

189
00:12:16,759 -> 00:12:17,148
Change

190
00:12:17,507 -> 00:12:20,931
Hal!. If you can give us some clues,
that could really speed up things.

191
00:12:23,256 -> 00:12:25,156
You see, he does not know you finished talking.

192
00:12:26,064 -> 00:12:30,336
No, I put in an awkward position.
You are asking me to betray my brothers.

193
00:12:30,553 -> 00:12:33,725
Francis, we are concerned about the kids.
They will not get into trouble.

194
00:12:34,134 -> 00:12:35,383
Wow, when got new parents?

195
00:12:35,633 -> 00:12:37,896
Listen, little grain, better tell me where they are

196
00:12:37,896 -> 00:12:41,053
Before you jump on the phone and you
rip your fucking mouth face.

197
00:12:41,053 -> 00:12:41,882
Who is it?

198
00:12:42,131 -> 00:12:45,445
Kenarban my name is Kitty, and my
Little Stevie is lost outside.

199
00:12:45,445 -> 00:12:48,935
Your inhaler is running out
and have poor night vision.

200
00:12:49,459 -> 00:12:50,648
Wait, Stevie is with them?

201
00:12:50,976 -> 00:12:53,915
Ok, you did not hear from me but
checaría old paint factory.

202
00:12:54,185 -> 00:12:55,509
It's full of paint cans.

203
00:12:56,022 -> 00:12:58,962
Oh and the store at night in the 5th has a back door that is loose.

204
00:12:58,962 -> 00:13:02,305
If Stevie can swim, well I guess
They are now 40 miles.

205
00:13:03,471 -> 00:13:05,237
Look, just start with those places.

206
00:13:05,673 -> 00:13:08,704
The others are too alarming and there is no necessary sense of panic.

207
00:13:15,472 -> 00:13:17,407
Happy thoughts, happy thoughts.

208
00:13:17,407 -> 00:13:20,031
Puppies, ice cream, fat people falling.

209
00:13:20,641 -> 00:13:21,485
I think we lost.

210
00:13:21,701 -> 00:13:23,610
... Where's Dewey?

211
00:13:24,935 -> 00:13:25,969
My God, where is it?

212
00:13:26,377 -> 00:13:27,717
Look, I see as we go from here.

213
00:13:28,210 -> 00:13:31,383
We can meet to Dewey, he is quiet.
Mom and Dad never know who left.

214
00:13:31,641 -> 00:13:35,582
Do not leave a fallen comrade

215
00:13:35,582 -> 00:13:38,577
Shut up. Would not be in this mess
if you had not asked for help.

216
00:13:38,577 -> 00:13:42,046
Keep pushing silly

217
00:13:42,765 -> 00:13:44,380
Look, we can find Dewey.

218
00:13:44,591 -> 00:13:48,611
We just need to start on one side of the park to the other and stay away from that duty.

219
00:13:48,611 -> 00:13:52,095
That does not, not that.
We'll stay right here.

220
00:13:54,048 -> 00:13:57,344
The maniac is out there somewhere
waiting for us.

221
00:14:03,562 -> 00:14:05,576
Save yourself

222
00:14:25,437 -> 00:14:27,863
Man, he has to Stevie.
We must do something.

223
00:14:28,076 -> 00:14:30,686
Why? Maybe this is your time.
Who are we to judge God?

224
00:14:32,296 -> 00:14:32,849
Reese!

225
00:14:35,722 -> 00:14:37,532
What is taking so long?

226
00:14:38,095 -> 00:14:40,658
In few places kids can hide in a desguesadero.

227
00:14:44,097 -> 00:14:46,687
Auto lights, auto lights

228
00:14:49,086 -> 00:14:50,813
Come, come, come on!

229
00:14:56,055 -> 00:14:58,032
Eat my dust!
Stupid dog!

230
00:14:58,089 -> 00:14:59,578
Hal wins again!

231
00:15:03,630 -> 00:15:04,470
They were not there.

232
00:15:05,644 -> 00:15:06,923
How can this be happening?

233
00:15:07,330 -> 00:15:10,722
Steve never usually do things like that.
The is usually a good boy.

234
00:15:11,455 -> 00:15:16,072
He held my fabric and yarn when I
held her yarn when the fabric.

235
00:15:16,517 -> 00:15:17,692
He made this sweater.

236
00:15:18,643 -> 00:15:22,109
Kitty I'm so sorry.
This is all because of my children.

237
00:15:22,473 -> 00:15:27,100
They make everyone they have contact
criminals. They are like a virus

238
00:15:27,553 -> 00:15:28,975
Look, do not blame your children.

239
00:15:29,750 -> 00:15:32,352
Well, yes. The thing is that Stevie
put his hand on this

240
00:15:32,352 -> 00:15:38,813
He has changed. Since entering high school has
become reserved and silent and locks herself in her room.

241
00:15:39,411 -> 00:15:41,222
We should not allow you to have that door.

242
00:15:42,191 -> 00:15:44,723
I guess a few months ahead difficult.

243
00:15:45,925 -> 00:15:46,988
"A few months?

244
00:15:47,550 -> 00:15:50,923
Well, when I grow up and understand
the damage we do ...

245
00:15:51,221 -> 00:15:53,109
Then it will be much better at it.

246
00:15:53,578 -> 00:15:57,640
Let's face it, teenagers are reckless and small eating machines.

247
00:15:57,845 -> 00:16:01,145
Dedicated to show us hell
and send to an early grave

248
00:16:01,861 -> 00:16:04,548
These guys just do not know how much we suffer.

249
00:16:06,203 -> 00:16:07,047
What is that buzzing?

250
00:16:07,833 -> 00:16:08,850
Ah, is massage

251
00:16:10,760 -> 00:16:11,550
I put out.

252
00:16:17,189 -> 00:16:19,251
You kids do not know who put

253
00:16:20,047 -> 00:16:24,924
I catch a child in wheelchair
that skillful

254
00:16:25,166 -> 00:16:28,062
Shut up, you were talking when I say

255
00:16:28,456 -> 00:16:30,508
Shudder ... in my chair

256
00:16:45,299 -> 00:16:46,501
Do not go anywhere.

257
00:16:51,876 -> 00:16:53,868
I think we should run to the gate
and call the police

258
00:16:53,868 -> 00:16:55,400
No, we should stay right here

259
00:16:55,725 -> 00:16:57,162
This is good
This is smart

260
00:17:01,439 -> 00:17:03,204
We are exposed,
we have to move

261
00:17:03,204 -> 00:17:05,113
No, this guy is a psychopath.

262
00:17:05,455 -> 00:17:07,846
He probably should have
bodies buried all over the country

263
00:17:08,142 -> 00:17:12,860
The fair comes to town, he kills a few
residents and packed to go kill some more.

264
00:17:12,860 -> 00:17:14,367
Shut up, we'll be okay.

265
00:17:19,448 -> 00:17:22,144
Look, I just want you to know that
Always try to be a good brother

266
00:17:22,394 -> 00:17:26,019
And when you hit and all those things I did
because you deserved it and it was fun.

267
00:17:26,298 -> 00:17:27,566
But that does not mean it is well

268
00:17:27,566 -> 00:17:29,925
Reese please stop talking like that.
We'll be alright.

269
00:17:31,219 -> 00:17:31,809
Be careful.

270
00:17:32,701 -> 00:17:33,435
Hi guys

271
00:17:33,981 -> 00:17:35,784
Dewey, this is not funny

272
00:17:36,496 -> 00:17:37,349
Where's Stevie?

273
00:17:37,349 -> 00:17:38,191
I grabbed the guard

274
00:17:38,495 -> 00:17:41,386
If, locked him in his trailer
and he is doing who knows what.

275
00:17:42,469 -> 00:17:43,527
Maybe my friends can help.

276
00:17:43,969 -> 00:17:44,581
What friends?

277
00:18:07,519 -> 00:18:08,838
We come in peace

278
00:18:11,760 -> 00:18:12,339
Hello?

279
00:18:12,608 -> 00:18:13,231
I am

280
00:18:13,231 -> 00:18:15,565
I talked to Richie.
He has a couple of ideas if they want to hear them.

281
00:18:15,809 -> 00:18:16,785
Francis, change.

282
00:18:18,559 -> 00:18:22,123
First he said that the porn shop is having a window Redford auction

283
00:18:22,463 -> 00:18:24,449
Oh yeah and the county fair
is in town now.

284
00:18:25,778 -> 00:18:26,436
Okay

285
00:18:29,904 -> 00:18:31,374
Of course, fair.

286
00:18:45,120 -> 00:18:46,670
Your friends think they can hide.

287
00:18:48,105 -> 00:18:49,782
I teach a small lesson

288
00:18:50,495 -> 00:18:55,810
They already know how to win 6 dollars per hour.

289
00:18:56,270 -> 00:18:56,936
Shut up!

290
00:19:34,301 -> 00:19:36,981
Phil let's be reasonable about it

291
00:19:37,830 -> 00:19:39,917
Why not let the little boy go?

292
00:19:40,156 -> 00:19:43,201
Over here, Gorak.
You can not tell me to do.

293
00:19:43,565 -> 00:19:45,396
I'm in charge of security.

294
00:19:46,693 -> 00:19:50,661
I understand that and are
doing a fabulous job

295
00:19:50,868 -> 00:19:55,529
But guess what I'm asking
comes into the category of a favor

296
00:19:56,427 -> 00:19:58,305
Can you do me a favor, phil?

297
00:19:59,069 -> 00:20:02,772
Why should you a favor?
You never have made me any favors.

298
00:20:04,529 -> 00:20:05,945
Is this because of the birthday party?

299
00:20:06,399 -> 00:20:07,046
No

300
00:20:07,729 -> 00:20:11,757
Phil I said, was trying to be small

301
00:20:12,681 -> 00:20:19,463
If you invited had to invite the conseciones rates, the ticket sellers, including carriers.

302
00:20:20,976 -> 00:20:24,445
I could not afford that.
It was nothing personal.

303
00:20:25,104 -> 00:20:26,008
Really?

304
00:20:26,709 -> 00:20:30,663
Look, we'll have a poker game this
weekend, why do not you join us?

305
00:20:31,679 -> 00:20:32,601
"I can deliver?

306
00:20:34,773 -> 00:20:36,429
Of course you can divide

307
00:20:40,024 -> 00:20:43,309
Thanks for taking care of our children, Gorak.
Hope you do not have caused much trouble.

308
00:20:43,635 -> 00:20:45,148
Hey, I know how they can be children.

309
00:20:45,383 -> 00:20:46,763
I have two little monsters.

310
00:20:47,289 -> 00:20:49,812
And do not forget Hal, poker weekend.

311
00:20:50,165 -> 00:20:50,927
Absolutely.

312
00:20:52,192 -> 00:20:54,162
Too bad the children were lost to our show.

313
00:20:54,616 -> 00:20:57,102
The next we're in the city
will bring between racks.

314
00:20:57,304 -> 00:20:59,274
Only if you accept our homemade food

315
00:20:59,700 -> 00:21:00,453
You got it, lois.

316
00:21:02,483 -> 00:21:05,866
The boys had a night
hard not to be harsh.

317
00:21:06,303 -> 00:21:08,104
Right now I am concerned only take home.

318
00:21:12,463 -> 00:21:16,138
This sucks. This would have been perfect
if Francis had not betrayed us.

319
00:21:17,281 -> 00:21:18,431
Why are you smiling?

320
00:21:19,303 -> 00:21:21,294
