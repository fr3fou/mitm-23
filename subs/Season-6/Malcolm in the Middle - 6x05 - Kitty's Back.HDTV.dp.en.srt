4
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:39,100
It was good Abe!
Yes I know

5
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,400
Reese stops or you'll chopper leprosy

6
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,800
Thank you very much for
invited to the anniversary of Dewey

7
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,600
Are you having fun while my child?

8
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,300
I was not expecting anything and
I'm still disappointed

9
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,700
It's funny

10
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,400
I hope you like your gift cherished

11
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,900
You know birthdays will be
more complicated until our
financial situation improves

12
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,300
I love my pieces of each state

13
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,800
You see, we started by
that of California and the Maine

14
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,700
Oops, they both come from Maine

15
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,300
You no longer need that the

16
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,200
Where is Francis?
It was supposed to be for my birthday party

17
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:15,600
He called. There was a program on TV that
do not want to miss it will be once
you're asleep you

18
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,600
Well I do not want to overshadow
our star of the day Dewey

19
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:19,600
Feel free to me

20
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,200
I can not keep the news to me

21
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,700
Stevie has been selected to receive
a "prize courtesy"!

22
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,800
This is fantastic

23
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,800
I do not see who else you could have

24
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:32,700
What is it like price?

25
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:36,900
The International Association of courtesy to
decided to give it a "Gallet"

26
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,700
It is a reward that gives young
man who respects the laws of courtesy:
impeccable, discreet, polite, gentle and obedient

27
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,300
Congratulations, Stevie.

28
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,700
Thank you.

29
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,300
See? it never stops.

30
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,100
We are all very proud of you Stevie.

31
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,300
In your place, I will keep it to myself.

32
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,100
There are limits to the protection
Disability

33
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,300
The awards ceremony will take place on 12

34
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,200
We would like you're there.

35
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:04,600
You were so nice to us
when things were difficult,
you're part of the family

36
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,800
By the way how is the divorce, Abe?
You finally found Kitty?

37
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,900
Address but not seeking
on the internet, I found very pictures
interesting

38
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:15,500
It seems she has overcome her fear
make new friends

39
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,400
But the page is turned to me.

40
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:22,100
Just yesterday, the charming
new teller of
my bank has flirted with me

41
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:22,600
Really?

42
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,900
Listen to this she told me that I had forgotten
to honor my check. Honor, Hal.

43
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,800
Wow.

44
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,800
Excited by this award?

45
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,800
It will take ...

46
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,300
you to help me ...

47
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,500
with my ...

48
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,200
speech.

49
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,700
There is ...

50
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,800
so ..

51
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,100
so many people ...

52
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,500
to thank.

53
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,600
And if you said just
"Thank you all"?

54
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,200
I ...

55
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,100
a plane.

56
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,500
Oh my god.
This is so cool.

57
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,200
Say, you know that under the skin, there are still the skin?

58
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,100
Why have I always been so careful?

59
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,700
Thank you for this wonderful evening.

60
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:23,000
You want me to tell you: I am seriously considering
I go to my bank tomorrow to see if the
new teller needs company

61
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,100
Kind of heartbreaker.
Leashes for your little buddies.

62
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,900
-Goodbye.
Good night.

63
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:30,700
Goodbye.

64
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:31,700
Let's go.

65
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:35,700
Kitty?

66
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,500
Kitty Kenarban!

67
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,100
It's how long you're out?

68
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:43,800
Not long. All evening.
It seemed like a great evening.

69
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,300
Hello, Hal.

70
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,000
Hello, Kitty.

71
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,200
I think ...

72
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,400
What are you doing there?

73
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,700
I sort of followed my family so far

74
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,300
Without the courage to speak to them

75
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,100
I want to go.

76
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,500
You want to go?

77
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,100
I know what I did was horrible.

78
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,400
I do not know what went through my head.

79
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:11,000
I think I spent so much
time stuck, completely rigid

80
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,500
something broke in me
and I had to be mean.

81
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,900
The last two years of my life
are a mist

82
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,800
binge drinking in orgiastic
of hotel rooms

83
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,300
There were so many parties,
both parties so strange.

84
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:25,100
The game of musical chairs
will never be the same for me

85
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:30,000
Just as "The Four Corners"
"The game factor" or "Blind Man's Bluff."

86
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,700
You know what's really great?

87
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:35,500
Now that I have literally done everything.

88
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,300
It's over.

89
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:39,900
I stop.

90
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,100
You did everything?

91
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,600
And now I'm done.
Once and for all.

92
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,500
"Blind Man's Bluff" yes, but "Four Corners"?

93
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,700
I'm really, really sorry for everything
I did

94
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:52,300
I dream of me at the feet of Abe
and beg him to forgive me, but

95
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,100
it seems impossible today

96
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:59,100
Would you be kind enough to intervene
him for me?

97
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,000
Kitty ...

98
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:07,500
It is absolutely out of the question
I'm doing this for you

99
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,200
But ..

100
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,600
You left your family.

101
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:15,100
You realize the suffering,
the humiliation that you made to undergo a
lovely man

102
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,700
and a poor boy
innocent?

103
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,700
I know we have been friends in the past,
but what you have done is so
unclean

104
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,600
it is not enough to say "I'm sorry"
so that it gets better

105
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,300
It does not help.

106
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,300
Hey, so this party where it is?

107
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,200
Hello, Kitty.

108
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,400
Ok you tell me about it later

109
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,800
Ok, Dewey.
Now that you're old enough,

110
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,300
You'll follow iniatiaques rythes
Family brotherhood

111
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,100
Wow, seriously?

112
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:02,000
Yes, Reese knew it,
Malcolm knew that now it's your turn.

113
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,000
Great, it starts when?

114
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,000
Immediately.

115
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,500
Get out of that bed and lie down on the bed of brotherhood.

116
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,800
and give me the pillow of the brotherhood.

117
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,000
Hi, Abe.

118
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,500
We need to talk.

119
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:18,800
What's going on?

120
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Give me 5 seconds ...
I'm a little stressed.

121
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,400
- What happens?
- Kitty came to see me last night.

122
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,500
Oh, Abe.
Do you want tea or coffee?

123
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,400
Thank you but what I want,
is to see more clearly

124
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:30,500
What?

125
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:34,200
Have you actually told the woman I love
you found it disgusting and evil?

126
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:42,700
- Wait a minute. You want me to me?
- What happened, Abe?

127
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,100
We talked all night with Kitty
and she told me absolutely everything

128
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,800
In detail as horrific as it is

129
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,300
And in the morning, we decided to
be given a second chance

130
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,200
Stevie is on cloud nine, he needs a mom.

131
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,100
And God knows how much I need a woman

132
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,900
So, I'd like that in the future, Lois,

133
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,400
you to do be a little more understanding
and respect my wife

134
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,700
You're mad at me?

135
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:08,600
You'll do as if he had
nothing happened in the last 2 years?

136
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:12,600
Not because you are not concerned,
nobody asks you to give your opinion

137
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,200
Should you see it.

138
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,500
Tell you that I'll never get anything in my life

139
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,700
Prepare to be amazed

140
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,300
I will fully peel me toes hair
to have a single skin

141
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,500
The most unheard of thing all the time

142
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,800
Reese, that horror removed immediately
my chair and releases.

143
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,000
We're talking about very important things

144
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:34,700
Ok, you do not have a penny on the Rights
Film

145
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,600
How dare you blame me for me?

146
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,400
I've always been there for you day after day,
month after month

147
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,900
I invited you to dinner, listening to crying on the phone

148
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,400
It was me who went to PTA meetings / students
for your son. Finally, Abe.

149
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,500
I'm your friend

150
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,900
So I expect you to be like you're conduises

151
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:54,700
And now if you'll excuse me.
I have a whole photo album of wedding
to go pick up.

152
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:04,000
Get the flow of water seals
our bonds of brotherhood

153
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:10,300
Although separated by a diabolical maternity
these links are eternal.

154
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,600
Ok I think that's it I felt something

155
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,300
Well, Dewey.
Bon appetite.

156
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:22,200
You'll need energy if you want
take the next 3 days

157
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,700
You took three days off to do it

158
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,800
Stop saving me time and sucks it

159
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,900
By ... on ... everything ...

160
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,000
I love ...

161
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,500
thank ...

162
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,800
my father.

163
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:43,900
I have.

164
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:53,500
Ladies and gentlemen, dear friends,
Dear families, colleagues estimated the
courtesy.

165
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:57,300
It is a great honor and I take
the opportunity

166
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,800
which is given to me tonight
share with you

167
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,800
Hoist the banner of all the cordiality
and

168
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,900
Reese ...
We're trying to work on speech Stevie.

169
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,500
The timing is critical guys.

170
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:12,700
I found a button and I do not know
if I go around and I pull all

171
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,100
The skin is pretty darn fine.

172
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,100
You're grotesque, Reese.

173
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,500
You do not you realize the
crucial step that I have undertaken, Malcolm.

174
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,200
I am trying to create a new Reese.

175
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,500
I get rid of my old life, it is
why snakes are eternal

176
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,200
You're an idiot.

177
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,300
I have brought chips and lemonade,
anyone?

178
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,000
No thank you ...

179
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,800
my mom ... ignoble

180
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,600
gave me the juice.

181
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:36,900
This is not fair, Hal.

182
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:39,700
I do not see why this is mine
they want

183
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,700
Kitty demolished their lives.

184
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,800
She was persecuted for
2 years and I'm the bad?

185
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,400
I did not give my name to me an STD.

186
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,500
It is not I who carried God only
knows what across the Turkish border.

187
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:53,200
Hal?

188
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,300
You're absolutely right dear

189
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,900
- I have said exactly the same thing.
- Hal, do you think it helps me that kind of comment.

190
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,600
Excuse me but you're Lois put you in trouble alone.

191
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,800
Since the time, you should know that you should not say anything
wrong on a girl to a guy who just broke up with her

192
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,400
They always end up getting back together

193
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,600
We loins of high school romances

194
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,800
And I do not understand how it
could forgive him

195
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,800
He loves it all and despite everything
happened it is still in love with her, I
understand

196
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,000
If it happened to us, I also
forgive you

197
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,100
What are you talking about? I know very
while not

198
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,300
Without you life has no meaning

199
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,200
Do not be silly. Go goodnight.

200
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,700
You're not too old for this?

201
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:37,800
Get ready to enjoy the beverage product of enfort
fraternal

202
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:41,100
It stinks it's horrible. Wait, is the tray
the fridge

203
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,900
Do not ask questions.

204
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,700
I never drink this tray,
it's disgusting.

205
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,500
That's right, it's dirty but must perform the ritual

206
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,100
Good to go.

207
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,500
Great, Dewey.
You did it!

208
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:58,800
I finished?

209
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
You overcame the tests with flying colors.
You are now a member of the brotherhood.

210
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,500
I will now give you ...

211
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,300
the cookie fraternity.

212
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,300
- That's it?
- How so?

213
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,700
I did all these stupid things for a common cookie?

214
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,500
This is not just any cookie.

215
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,900
It is a symbol of something very
special little ungrateful.

216
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,400
It is the symbol that I'm a big stupid.

217
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,700
You did not understand the brotherhood and content
its ritual.

218
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,500
Give me back my cookie.

219
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,300
I am now faced with a major obstacle.

220
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,800
I had forgotten that the sun does not cross the clothes.

221
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,000
You got leggings danceuses?

222
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,300
As well as do something that is niquel.

223
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,800
And I backup.

224
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,200
I think it will work.

225
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,400
Why ...

226
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:48,800
it need your mom ...

227
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,700
be so mean?

228
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,800
When it's really good in one area,
it clings.

229
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:54,900
I'm glad ...

230
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:56,600
you understand ...

231
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,400
about my mother.

232
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,200
What makes you think that?

233
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:01,700
What?

234
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:05,700
Stevie, I can imagine that my mother
cows has said things and unjustified.

235
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,900
But your mother abandoned you both.

236
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,400
Have you ever forgotten the horrors that you
was subjected?

237
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,100
It is too easy to clear all
saying I'm sorry.

238
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,400
This ...

239
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,300
Conversation ...

240
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,500
is ..

241
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,100
complete.

242
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:24,600
hand ...

243
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,600
piece.

244
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,400
I need some help, I
hard behind the

245
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,800
Rise turns me this horror

246
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:34,400
What are you wasting your time to help Steve
prepare for its price to two bullets

247
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,300
and you're not even able to help your own
brother to become immortal?

248
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:37,900
Out!

249
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,000
Stevie ...

250
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,200
Wait!

251
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,900
Ok, Ok
I know what it is.

252
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,500
You do not want to reach my dream

253
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,900
I'm sorry you missed the award ceremony
Courtesy

254
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,500
But we must monitor the status of Dewey

255
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:00,500
What the doctor said?

256
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:04,700
A very strange thing. It would have caught
one thing intestines qu'attrapent
the inhabitants of the third world

257
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,700
by drinking stagnant water.

258
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,200
Bizarre ...

259
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,100
You know, you're not obliged to go.

260
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:14,800
Hal, Stevie is a lovely boy
and I want to support it deserves ..

261
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,300
- He does not want you to come.
- Too bad.

262
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,100
I will promote it like it
or not.

263
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:22,100
They think I have a problem, they are mistaken
all Hal.

264
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,400
And I will not let them
away with it.

265
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,000
I'm just saying it might be really bad at home

266
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,100
That I guarantee you we will be

267
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:34,000
And if you do anything to relax
the atmosphere I do not forgive you

268
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,100
Thank you very much to "Jam Master".

269
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,300
Who said rap was rude?

270
00:14:55,300 --> 00:15:00,500
I would like to thank all those who have
allowed this event to take place

271
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,600
Unfortunately not enough time ...

272
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,700
Just kidding, we all the time.

273
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:12,400
Erin Errison Barnett Errison,
Barnett Junior Errison ...

274
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,300
When I think you're coming with
this stuff

275
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
This thing has a name Malcolm

276
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,800
While mashed potatoes is not
supposed to accompany the duck

277
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:25,200
I like that against all odds, like it
Duck or not

278
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,800
- Ok and for you?
- A fillet of beef.

279
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,900
Even though I know that carrots are the background
the problem, I would much rather give up broccoli

280
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:34,900
This may be an excellent metaphor Mrs.
but you will ruin your meal

281
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,600
I'll have another Margarita

282
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,500
And speed, it is a matter of life or death

283
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,200
You still want the paper, Dewey?

284
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:44,700
Shut up!

285
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,700
If-you-please, I'm sorry.
I got carried away.

286
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,100
You know, you really missed

287
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:56,000
The humiliation and torture is the only way
to express our love

288
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,900
The only person you comfort by saying
this is yourself

289
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,500
Ok, ok.

290
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:04,100
I want to give you something, Dewey.
Something special.

291
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,200
I've never talked to Malcolm and Reese

292
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,100
This is the ultimate defense against Mom and Dad,
warranty bulletproof

293
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:12,800
I'm listening.

294
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:18,100
In the room on the night table,
side Mom, there's a candle with vanilla,
you know where she is?

295
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,100
Yes ...

296
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,500
Mom and Dad the light when they go ...

297
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,300
when they make their adult stuff.

298
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,200
Sex you mean?

299
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:28,900
We taira details.

300
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:33,300
Whenever this candle is lit,
they only think of one thing,

301
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,600
return to their room.

302
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,500
And it works all the time

303
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:42,800
Wow.
Thank you.

304
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,600
We are now brothers candle

305
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,600
Francis, you must stop raving.

306
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,500
Another Margarita if you please.

307
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,400
I learned a lot tonight.

308
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:59,000
I did not know there were so many
ways to say thank you

309
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,700
I would like there to be more to say
it was not a pleasure

310
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:02,700
Excuse me.

311
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,000
You know what's missing?
A Margarita.

312
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,500
Lois, please.
This tension is unbearable.

313
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,900
Kitty sorry but I'm not amnesic

314
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,900
You are the only one to have a problem with that

315
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,500
You are a very well-bred old lady

316
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,700
Can I have a hug?

317
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,300
Excuse me.

318
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,500
Come here grandma, make me a hug.

319
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:27,800
Alcohol is over for him.

320
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,800
This is Kitty Kenarban there at your table?

321
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:31,800
Yes.

322
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,200
You have both the same occupations so

323
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,700
You know, sniff sniff, rrrr?

324
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:37,900
I beg your pardon?

325
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,900
No nothing

326
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,300
Could you give it to me?

327
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:47,500
It was part of the choir, it is
possible that she wants to join us
work her singing

328
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,200
With great pleasure.

329
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:56,100
Ladies and gentlemen, I ask you
host presenter PBS
Frank Walston.

330
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,300
Before receiving our guest of honor

331
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:05,300
I'd like to tell you all a few words about
courtesy

332
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:10,100
I am aware that from time to time good
ways seem to be a bunch of cans rules

333
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,900
invented by our parents lectured us to better

334
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
That you said!

335
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,600
But the way it's so much

336
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:24,400
Only human beings have a code
reminding them to behave them

337
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:27,400
That allows us to live in harmony

338
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,900
They allow us to live graciously
with each other

339
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:34,600
but the most important is that, thanks to them

340
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:37,600
we can forgive ourselves.

341
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:43,200
Good manners allow us to hear the echo
of what there is best in us

342
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,400
And what delights me ...

343
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,600
Kitty, if-you-please forgive me.

344
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,700
Well, the best is yet to come

345
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:04,700
Welcome so warmly and courteously

346
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:09,100
our "Gallent" this year, Stevie Kenarban.

347
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:24,500
Ladies and gentlemen, dear friends,
Dear families, colleagues estimated the
courtesy ..

348
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:30,800
It is a great honor and I take this opportunity to me
sucks, sucks, sucks, sucks

349
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:34,000
This means so much to me
and so little for you

350
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,200
lick my ass

351
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,300
In conclusion, this event does not
be complete without that I found you

352
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,500
I'm actually a girl

353
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,800
Thank you, fuck you

354
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:47,900
He speaks

355
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,200
He is cured

356
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,300
Reese, I noted that your punishment
will be lifted when the carlage
bathroom does rayon

357
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,400
so much so that you could eat off it
that thou wilt also for 2 weeks

358
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:01,400
And rid yourself of this is disgusting

359
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,000
Disgusting?

360
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,300
If Malcolm had his clone

361
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,200
I'm sure you'd be trying to compliment

362
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,500
No!

363
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,400
He sucked

364
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,000
It could have been me

365
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,600
I need to be alone with the vacuum cleaner

366
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:36,900
You must sign this paper

367
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,200
You have disrupted the class?

368
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,500
Insulted the teacher?

369
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,700
Dewey I warn you that it will ...

370
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,200
heat.

371
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,300
We will have found a punishment
up to ...

372
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,600
- Punishment.
- Yes it will be really really ...

373
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,200
It's very nice dear.

374
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,300
You, you're ...

375
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,700
Dewey, let's talk
later.

376
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,300
Absolutely.

377
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,000
Laws, there is something I want
show you in our room.

378
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:13,400
