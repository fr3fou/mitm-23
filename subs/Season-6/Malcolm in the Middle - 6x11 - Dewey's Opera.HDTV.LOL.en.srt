1
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:05,550
Hal, did you baby-proof the kitchen like I asked you to?

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I'm doing it right now.

3
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:21,180

4
00:00:30,209 --> 00:00:31,249
This is so boring.

5
00:00:32,342 --> 00:00:34,293
It's your fault for inviting Stevie over.

6
00:00:34,548 --> 00:00:38,152
He can't do anything, so we can't do anything,
and it's always boring and lame.

7
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:39,435
Reese, he's not deaf.

8
00:00:40,826 --> 00:00:41,850
I have...

9
00:00:43,809 --> 00:00:44,750
my fun.

10
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,154
This is exactly what I'm talking about.

11
00:00:48,572 --> 00:00:50,312
This would be fun if I were looking at it.

12
00:00:50,671 --> 00:00:52,620
When you read it, it's not fun; it's sad.

13
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:55,133
Now I'm bored and sad.
Thanks a lot, Stevie!

14
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:55,883
Reese!

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,017
No, it's horrible.

16
00:00:57,185 --> 00:01:01,495
I think it sucks that he always gets his face rubbed
in the fact that he will never get to enjoy anything.

17
00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:05,333
Maybe he'd be happier if they stuck
you in some kind of special tank.

18
00:01:06,292 --> 00:01:07,347
Whoa, check this out!

19
00:01:07,588 --> 00:01:07,901
What?

20
00:01:07,902 --> 00:01:08,756
Street-luging!

21
00:01:09,029 --> 00:01:09,919
<i>Look at those pictures!</i>

22
00:01:10,515 --> 00:01:13,637
"Police call it the most reckless,
dangerous teen craze in years."

23
00:01:14,344 --> 00:01:16,602
It says they look back with
fondness on the crack epidemic.

24
00:01:16,747 --> 00:01:18,201
We could totally build a board like that!

25
00:01:21,436 --> 00:01:22,573
Except we wouldn't.

26
00:01:22,702 --> 00:01:24,100
Because our parents wouldn't allow it.

27
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:27,319
So, since we're not doing it,
no one has to say anything.

28
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:31,470
Yes, this sport seems immature,
and frankly, I just think it's uncool.

29
00:01:31,917 --> 00:01:33,590
Hey, Stevie, look, Pentominos.

30
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:34,512
Why were we bored?

31
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:40,134
So, you just bought a new bed, just like that.

32
00:01:40,284 --> 00:01:44,426
Hal, we had that smelly, saggy old one
for 20 years. It's time for a new one.

33
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,552
This one is certainly bigger.

34
00:01:46,553 --> 00:01:48,408
Yeah. It's king-sized. They're a little bigger.

35
00:01:49,179 --> 00:01:50,172
So you'll be further away.

36
00:01:50,525 --> 00:01:52,100
I guess. Maybe a couple inches.

37
00:01:52,803 --> 00:01:53,699
So, is that the reason?

38
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:56,165
You want there to be more distance between us?

39
00:01:56,347 --> 00:01:59,479
Hal, I didn't really think about the size.
It was on sale at Mattress King.

40
00:01:59,983 --> 00:02:01,883
I guess you couldn't pass up a deal like that, huh?

41
00:02:02,529 --> 00:02:04,628
It's just interesting to learn how it starts.

42
00:02:04,629 --> 00:02:05,634
How what starts?

43
00:02:05,635 --> 00:02:08,239
Well, first you buy the king-size
bed, the largest bed made.

44
00:02:08,524 --> 00:02:14,330
But then of course, at some point, even the giant bed doesn't
put enough distance between you and the hideous monster.

45
00:02:14,473 --> 00:02:20,135
So you start sleeping in another room. Then soon, we're
barely exchanging pleasantries, and then one day you say,

46
00:02:20,136 --> 00:02:23,250
"Hal, let's just say what we're both thinking."

47
00:02:23,251 --> 00:02:27,648
And then, I end up eating alone on a Formica
table under a swinging lightbulb while you,

48
00:02:27,649 --> 00:02:33,960
are on a beach in Ibiza being rubbed with cocoa butter
by your new lover who you can never get too close to!

49
00:02:33,961 --> 00:02:35,490
Hal, it's a bed!

50
00:02:35,766 --> 00:02:38,535
The old one was horrible. This one is nice.

51
00:02:40,127 --> 00:02:43,321
Look, I know this is a big change for you.

52
00:02:43,766 --> 00:02:49,278
So I'm just going to have to think of some way
to make you very, very happy in this bed.

53
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:51,061
Good luck!

54
00:02:58,016 --> 00:02:59,434
I'm here to snitch.

55
00:02:59,869 --> 00:03:01,252
Reese and Malcolm are in the garage.

56
00:03:01,503 --> 00:03:03,284
They won't let me in, but they're building something.

57
00:03:03,688 --> 00:03:05,732
If you want help in the penalty phase, let me know.

58
00:03:05,733 --> 00:03:09,971
Dewey, I am not going to go in there and have a big
fight with the boys because you've got nothing to do.

59
00:03:10,256 --> 00:03:13,212
We have a rule in this family about
what we do when we're bored.

60
00:03:56,666 --> 00:04:00,550
I don't care if they are your skateboard wheels.
We're not putting a "No Fat Chicks" sticker on it.

61
00:04:00,743 --> 00:04:02,126
All right, but it's still our policy.

62
00:04:03,377 --> 00:04:04,383
What're you crying about?

63
00:04:04,384 --> 00:04:08,049
I was just sitting there and this, this opera came on.

64
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,924
People screaming and hating.

65
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:13,246
It was our family, but with music!

66
00:04:13,504 --> 00:04:18,952
And they all mixed together in a counterpoint
that underscored the futility of their lives!

67
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:26,171
And the stretto showed the minor key had been
hiding in the subdominant from the very first bar.

68
00:04:28,277 --> 00:04:29,282
All I understood was,

69
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,909
"Hit me, Reese. Hit me and never stop hitting me."

70
00:04:32,894 --> 00:04:34,243
Yeah, well, that was the gist of it.

71
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:47,721
The animals in the farm include, but are not limited to,
the cow, the horse, the pig, the chicken, the sheep.

72
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:53,054
Dewey, the algebra homework you gave us,
did you want us to show our work?

73
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:54,809
Huh? I dunno.

74
00:04:55,342 --> 00:04:55,904
Just a sec.

75
00:04:56,617 --> 00:04:57,275
<i>... the alpaca,</i>

76
00:04:58,229 --> 00:04:58,792
You okay?

77
00:04:59,251 --> 00:05:00,768
You want to wrap your hands in tinfoil?

78
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:02,373
I have nothing!

79
00:05:02,716 --> 00:05:03,865
I want to write an opera.

80
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,379
I know I can do it.

81
00:05:05,651 --> 00:05:06,690
I have all the music.

82
00:05:06,947 --> 00:05:08,261
<i>I can hear it in my head.</i>

83
00:05:08,846 --> 00:05:10,817
I just don't have a story to hang it on.

84
00:05:11,315 --> 00:05:14,161
It has to be something so dramatic
it's like a knife in the heart.

85
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,830
... the peccary, the hog bear,

86
00:05:17,185 --> 00:05:18,480
That's the trouble with being a kid.

87
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:19,855
I want a dog.

88
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,856
I don't have a dog.

89
00:05:21,555 --> 00:05:23,161
But ultimately, so what?

90
00:05:23,784 --> 00:05:35,119
The sounds produced by said animals are, respectively:
moo, neigh, oink, cluck, gobble, silent.

91
00:05:39,033 --> 00:05:40,022
I don't see anyone.

92
00:05:40,575 --> 00:05:41,773
Are you sure this is the right place?

93
00:05:41,878 --> 00:05:42,354
I don't know.

94
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:45,014
It was a pretty reputable extreme sport chat room.

95
00:05:59,022 --> 00:05:59,448
Hey!

96
00:06:00,726 --> 00:06:01,632
Is it cool if we ride with you?

97
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,058
All right! This is gonna be fun!

98
00:06:13,255 --> 00:06:13,591
Nope.

99
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:14,550
That's not gonna happen.

100
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,460
Too steep, too dangerous. I might die.

101
00:06:16,774 --> 00:06:17,832
Call me a girl. I don't care.

102
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,832
You know what? I'm gonna try it.

103
00:06:21,543 --> 00:06:22,460
Are you serious, dude?

104
00:06:22,728 --> 00:06:23,529
It's too steep.

105
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:25,394
Your face will be like an inch from the asphalt.

106
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,390
No, I'm pretty sure I can do this.

107
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:29,199
Malcolm, seriously. Think about this.

108
00:06:29,415 --> 00:06:31,223
<i>I don't want you killed or brain-damaged.</i>

109
00:06:31,575 --> 00:06:32,547
You're my brother and...

110
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:45,840
Hey, this isn't bad.
I'm actually having fun.

111
00:06:46,533 --> 00:06:47,028
Wow.

112
00:06:47,492 --> 00:06:49,766
I think I'm gonna turn out to be a really good luger.

113
00:06:50,297 --> 00:06:53,700
The whole unpopular thing will be just
a funny story about my days pre-luge.

114
00:06:54,314 --> 00:06:55,900
I bet I'll get my own line of clothing.

115
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,000
Maybe a girlfriend. Maybe two.

116
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:00,299
They'd fight over me, but I'd make them work it out.

117
00:07:09,798 --> 00:07:11,689
Someone owes me an extreme apology!

118
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:13,749
<i>Hey!</i>

119
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:15,289
Hey, you! Jerk!

120
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,185
You totally made me crash!

121
00:07:17,495 --> 00:07:21,592
Just because you can blow a lot of money on some
high-end luge doesn't mean you're not a jerk!

122
00:07:21,737 --> 00:07:22,723
You're just a rich jerk.

123
00:07:23,624 --> 00:07:24,140
Jerk!

124
00:07:57,466 --> 00:07:58,375
Aha!

125
00:07:58,730 --> 00:07:59,288
Hal!

126
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,626
Oh, what a blind fool I've been!

127
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:05,400
To think, when you said you didn't buy this
bed to get away from me, I believed you!

128
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:07,006
Oh, Hal, calm down!

129
00:08:07,376 --> 00:08:11,968
It's just that when you sleep you're so hot,
you radiate heat. You're like a giant radiator!

130
00:08:12,104 --> 00:08:16,037
And when I sleep, I need to flop my arms around
and I can't do that if you're on top of me!

131
00:08:16,147 --> 00:08:18,433
How long have you found me hideous?

132
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:21,386
<i>For God's sakes, this is why
I have to lie to you all the time!</i>

133
00:08:21,506 --> 00:08:23,057
<i>Did you ever love me?</i>

134
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:23,755
Who are you?

135
00:08:24,742 --> 00:08:25,629
Fair warning, Hal.

136
00:08:25,832 --> 00:08:28,310
If you wake that baby up, he is yours for the night!

137
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:30,785
<i>A sale at Mattress King?! Oh...</i>

138
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,867
You must have laughed at me for swallowing that one!

139
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,904
<i>They don't know the meaning of the word "sale" over there.</i>

140
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:37,527
<i>Their everyday prices are guaranteed rock-bottom!</i>

141
00:08:37,662 --> 00:08:40,900
<i>You're just working yourself up to get
your own way. You always do that, Hal.</i>

142
00:08:40,901 --> 00:08:43,365
What should I do when I know
that you looked me in the face...

143
00:08:43,492 --> 00:08:47,160
<i>And.... </i>

144
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:49,403
<i>You lied?</i>

145
00:08:51,514 --> 00:08:54,489
<i>Don't be hysterical. You always get hysterical.</i>

146
00:08:54,490 --> 00:09:00,200
<i>It's called having feelings. You should know.
You're an expert at faking them! </i>

147
00:09:00,412 --> 00:09:01,840
<i>At least mine are real!</i>

148
00:09:02,524 --> 00:09:04,551
<i>Hal, don't make a thing out of this!</i>

149
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,198
<i>What should a man do, when he knows
that he'll never be happy again? </i>

150
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,650
<i>Sing a song?</i>

151
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,300
<i>Just get a grip, Hal, don't overreact.</i>

152
00:09:15,611 --> 00:09:20,124
<i>Overreact? I feel horrible, I feel lousy! </i>

153
00:09:21,713 --> 00:09:25,684
<i>I'm having a stroke, seriously, Lois.
It feels just like one.</i>

154
00:09:25,804 --> 00:09:28,750
<i>We think it's one, too!
We're sure it's one, too!</i>

155
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:31,646
<i>It's a panic attack,</i>

156
00:09:31,915 --> 00:09:35,600
<i>Like that time in the laundromat,</i>

157
00:09:35,826 --> 00:09:39,836
<i>Breathe into a pillow!</i>

158
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:41,480
<i>Good idea.</i>

159
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:42,840
<i>A pillow?! </i>

160
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,759
<i>How cruel! How callous!</i>

161
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,005
<i>Poor Hal!</i>

162
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:51,820
<i>This stroke is the worst case of
emotional blackmail, she's ever seen! </i>

163
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:54,680
<i>And...</i>

164
00:09:54,999 --> 00:09:57,973
<i>I've seen plenty!</i>

165
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:59,613
<i>Call 911!</i>

166
00:09:59,614 --> 00:10:03,908
<i>Tell them a blood vessel just burst in my brain,
Just halfway between my neck and my nose.</i>

167
00:10:03,909 --> 00:10:10,360
<i>That's only if you care! If not, feel free
To sit by while I die, and watch Leno !</i>

168
00:10:10,361 --> 00:10:10,988
<i>Blackmail!</i>

169
00:10:10,989 --> 00:10:12,045
<i>Stroke!</i>

170
00:10:12,046 --> 00:10:13,050
<i>Blackmail!</i>

171
00:10:13,051 --> 00:10:14,075
<i>Stroke!</i>

172
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,500
<i>What a big baby!</i>

173
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,034
<i>What a giant stroke!</i>

174
00:11:34,386 --> 00:11:36,350
I'm not stopping till I take that guy down.

175
00:11:37,258 --> 00:11:39,016
How much skin is left on your chest?

176
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:39,620
Enough.

177
00:11:44,236 --> 00:11:44,917
You wanted...

178
00:11:45,956 --> 00:11:46,827
to see me.

179
00:11:47,015 --> 00:11:48,212
Stevie, brace yourself.

180
00:11:49,149 --> 00:11:56,098
I'm going to tell you a really big secret about something so huge that every
bone in your body is going to want to tell, but you have to promise not to.

181
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:00,836
This is an actual street luge.

182
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,250
Like from your magazine.

183
00:12:03,262 --> 00:12:05,580
Heaven... forfend.

184
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:10,575
I need you to help me with some calculations of wheel
friction and frame stiffness to get this thing perfect.

185
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:13,550
I have to beat this rich jerk who
keeps making me wipe out.

186
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:15,555
I'm going to make a bet with him, and race him.

187
00:12:15,978 --> 00:12:16,922
You think...

188
00:12:18,099 --> 00:12:19,118
you can beat...

189
00:12:20,393 --> 00:12:21,544
this glorious...

190
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:23,550
alpha male?

191
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:24,451
It's going to happen.

192
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:28,348
'Cause I'm going to hide in the bushes
and jump out at him and force him to crash.

193
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,510
It may not be the most honest thing in the world,
but you know what, who cares?

194
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,000
This guys totally deserves it.

195
00:12:34,106 --> 00:12:37,220
I'd hate... to be him.

196
00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:40,552
Hal, get in this bed and go to sleep!

197
00:12:40,553 --> 00:12:44,016
Oh, I'll sleep, Lois. I'll sleep where I'm wanted!

198
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:05,812
<i>Are you coming back to bed, or
should I just order a crib for you? </i>

199
00:13:06,405 --> 00:13:11,448
<i>I'm not coming back. I don't like
to be where I'm not wanted.</i>

200
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:15,300
<i>Especially if it's on a big giant bed!</i>

201
00:13:15,428 --> 00:13:18,374
<i>You've been on the couch for four days.</i>

202
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:21,241
<i>I can hold on as long as you can.</i>

203
00:13:21,242 --> 00:13:24,315
<i>I have nothing to apologize for!</i>

204
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:28,950
<i>Why would you? I bet they were
the best four days of your life... </i>

205
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:31,100
No! No! No!

206
00:13:31,578 --> 00:13:33,818
You're both holding back too much.

207
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:38,343
Glacienda, you sacrificed your future
for a family that's not even grateful.

208
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:42,075
You've got all this anger bubbling
up that's ready to explode!

209
00:13:42,459 --> 00:13:45,674
And Don Argento, you have nothing
in the world but that woman.

210
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:49,385
You hate your job, you don't have
friends and now you're losing her!

211
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:49,831
Dewey.

212
00:13:50,302 --> 00:13:53,359
When it says "Jamie wets his diaper,"
should I really wet myself?

213
00:13:53,536 --> 00:13:53,964
No.

214
00:13:54,599 --> 00:13:55,612
But on show night?

215
00:13:56,391 --> 00:13:57,700
If the second act drags.

216
00:13:58,029 --> 00:14:01,557
Dewey, the problem is that these
characters are just treading water.

217
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,923
I mean, it's been four days and we've
done four scenes with him on the couch.

218
00:14:07,324 --> 00:14:09,546
You're right. They're just stuck.

219
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:16,999
What if Don Argento solves his romantic problems with
a machete in a tragic, yet comedic, big bloody mess?

220
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:23,300
Yes, I want to return a mattress I bought last
week in accord with your 30-day return policy.

221
00:14:24,011 --> 00:14:25,441
Okay, I'll speak with the king.

222
00:14:25,717 --> 00:14:26,822
You're returning the bed?

223
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:28,008
That's it?

224
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,144
In what world is that an ending?

225
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,380
Your father and I were arguing. It's just not worth it.

226
00:14:32,381 --> 00:14:35,000
That doesn't seem like a very satisfying resolution.

227
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:37,234
Well, sometimes marriage is about getting by.

228
00:14:37,386 --> 00:14:39,039
You're not always satisfied with everything.

229
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:41,300
Wow.

230
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:43,450
I can't believe Dad was so right.

231
00:14:43,915 --> 00:14:46,131
He said if he made a big enough stink, he'd get his way.

232
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:49,749
Well, it's a good lesson for me, though. Thanks, Mom.

233
00:14:53,812 --> 00:14:55,295
Okay. 80 bucks.

234
00:14:55,605 --> 00:14:57,595
Street rules. Which means no rules.

235
00:14:57,931 --> 00:15:01,115
And don't let yourself think about what might happen,
because you don't want to get psyched out.

236
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:04,177
And don't think about getting psyched out
because you might get psyched out.

237
00:15:04,836 --> 00:15:06,474
People who get psyched out make mistakes.

238
00:15:07,247 --> 00:15:09,400
Good... advice.

239
00:15:10,157 --> 00:15:10,563
What?

240
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:10,900
Go!

241
00:16:21,886 --> 00:16:23,363
Oh, my God, Stevie, no!

242
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:44,130
All right, Hal, I didn't want to have to
say this, but you've pushed me to it.

243
00:16:45,417 --> 00:16:45,734
What?

244
00:16:46,745 --> 00:16:48,531
There's a reason I bought a bed that was bigger.

245
00:16:48,635 --> 00:16:53,541
I did want some distance from you, but it's not because
I don't love you and I don't want to be close to you.

246
00:16:53,701 --> 00:16:54,658
I don't understand.

247
00:16:55,462 --> 00:16:58,586
There are certain things that have to
happen with my body at the end of the day.

248
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:01,480
Certain events that have to... transpire.

249
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:07,643
And if they don't transpire, I end up with stomach cramps,
and I don't want it to happen two inches away from your nose.

250
00:17:09,182 --> 00:17:10,142
That's your secret?

251
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:17,780
I know it's stupid and embarrassing and I want to be sexy
for you, but after 20 years, I just have to have a break
from clamping down and gritting my teeth all night.

252
00:17:17,781 --> 00:17:19,915
Oh, honey, I don't care about that.

253
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:23,776
And it's not a secret. The second you
fall asleep you let loose like a sailor.

254
00:17:25,089 --> 00:17:25,428
What?

255
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:28,422
Oh, yeah, it's like when they put the balloons
away after the Thanksgiving parade.

256
00:17:30,497 --> 00:17:32,458
Oh, my God. I can't hear anything.

257
00:17:32,913 --> 00:17:33,850
You're tunneling out.

258
00:17:34,359 --> 00:17:35,800
Honey, honey, relax.

259
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,000
Honey, we're married.

260
00:17:39,552 --> 00:17:42,212
It doesn't matter how embarrassing something is.

261
00:17:43,413 --> 00:17:46,984
Because no one knows it... but me.

262
00:17:49,198 --> 00:17:51,549
<i>Lois... </i>

263
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:58,207
<i>Don't be embarrassed.</i>

264
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,949
<i>I know...</i>

265
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:07,667
<i>Everything about you.</i>

266
00:18:09,247 --> 00:18:11,808
<i>I know when you,</i>

267
00:18:11,809 --> 00:18:14,000
<i>think you're alone.</i>

268
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:19,011
<i>You have to check, if your ears have grown.</i>

269
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:27,800
<i>Every day, before you go to work.</i>

270
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:33,850
<i>You know how I panic,</i>

271
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:39,403
<i>When I see a monkey.</i>

272
00:18:40,082 --> 00:18:44,019
<i>I've seen you take pizza,</i>

273
00:18:44,398 --> 00:18:50,987
<i>From the garbage and eat it!</i>

274
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:55,200
<i>I know all of you,</i>

275
00:18:55,536 --> 00:18:57,980
<i>You know all of me.</i>

276
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:05,250
<i>But it's only us, my love !</i>

277
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:11,341
<i>No one else knows.</i>

278
00:19:12,747 --> 00:19:17,799
<i>No one else.</i>

279
00:19:18,611 --> 00:19:22,785
<i>No one else.</i>

280
00:19:23,547 --> 00:19:27,486
<i>No one...</i>

281
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:35,126
<i>Else.</i>

282
00:19:37,819 --> 00:19:38,771
I'll return the bed.

283
00:19:39,421 --> 00:19:41,395
Honey, you've fallen asleep for a week in that bed.

284
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,318
They're not gonna take it back.

285
00:20:09,629 --> 00:20:11,950
There you are. I was looking all over for you.

286
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:14,894
Boy, I wish I was you. The worst
thing in your life is taking a nap.

287
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:29,413
You still... owe me... 80 bucks.

288
00:20:30,185 --> 00:20:31,280
Take it out of my pocket.

289
00:20:45,569 --> 00:20:46,816
Ladies and gentlemen.

290
00:20:47,222 --> 00:20:55,229
We now present a story of shame, humiliation
and the deep personal secrets, that lurk within...

291
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,850
"The Marriage Bed."

292
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,100
Wow, everyone we know is here.

293
00:21:09,727 --> 00:21:11,891
I hope Dewey doesn't embarrass himself.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
