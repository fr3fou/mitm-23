1
00:00:08,889 --> 00:00:11,539
You flush the toilet, and I open the curtain.

5
00:00:52,785 --> 00:00:57,352
Grandma's visiting again. Sometimes she can't
spread enough misery with just a phone call.

6
00:00:57,706 --> 00:01:02,297
She must have felt a vibration of happiness at the edge
of her web and came scurrying down just to crush it.

7
00:01:02,841 --> 00:01:04,475
The worst thing is how it affects Mom.

8
00:01:05,263 --> 00:01:07,851
Mom, I took 20 bucks from your purse.
I'm never going to pay it back.

9
00:01:07,852 --> 00:01:10,500
I don't care who started it,
you and your brother work it out.

10
00:01:11,187 --> 00:01:12,951
See? It's sad.

11
00:01:16,554 --> 00:01:16,992
Oh!

12
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:20,000
Lois, I keep finding your mother's teeth everywhere.

13
00:01:20,001 --> 00:01:22,083
Is she spitting them out or are they escaping?

14
00:01:22,084 --> 00:01:24,995
She must be wearing her smoking teeth.
Those are her fancy teeth.

15
00:01:26,051 --> 00:01:31,267
Look, I can't fight every battle with her, Hal.
I got her to smoke outside. That's today's victory.

16
00:01:36,002 --> 00:01:39,141
Now that I have a car, I'm leaving
and I'm never coming back.

17
00:01:39,564 --> 00:01:43,131
No, Dewey, please don't go. We didn't
know it was the baby's thermometer.

18
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:46,025
It's too late for apologies. I'm out of here.

19
00:01:46,925 --> 00:01:49,339
Dewey, just name your price. We'll do anything.

20
00:01:49,758 --> 00:01:52,638
You think this is about money? This is about respect...

21
00:01:53,165 --> 00:01:54,735
Oh, crap.

22
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,057
Dad, chili for breakfast?

23
00:02:27,058 --> 00:02:29,806
Hey, Jamie ate two bowls and
you don't hear him complaining.

24
00:02:30,236 --> 00:02:31,638
Why isn't Mom back from Grandma's yet?

25
00:02:31,863 --> 00:02:34,336
For God's sakes, Reese, your grandmother lost a leg.

26
00:02:34,532 --> 00:02:38,587
Show a little compassion for your mother who's
stuck there taking care of that miserable hag.

27
00:02:38,761 --> 00:02:40,496
She'll be back when she gets back.

28
00:02:40,749 --> 00:02:43,245
And don't take this out on me.
I'm not the one who walked into the street.

29
00:02:44,231 --> 00:02:46,115
But no one's blaming you for this, Dewey.

30
00:02:46,285 --> 00:02:48,350
Dad, I already feel awful about it.

31
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:51,962
Which is exactly what I'm telling you
not to do. You need to stay positive.

32
00:02:52,201 --> 00:02:55,680
Think about how good you'll feel next time
when you remember to look both ways.

33
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,206
Shouldn't you boys be getting ready for school?

34
00:02:58,496 --> 00:02:59,081
Didn't you hear?

35
00:02:59,635 --> 00:03:01,853
They went to four-hour days. It's shameful.

36
00:03:02,154 --> 00:03:04,129
- The taxpayers won't even support...
- Forget it, Reese.

37
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:08,771
You are not going to misbehave this week.
Your mother already thinks I can't be trusted to watch you boys.

38
00:03:09,131 --> 00:03:12,078
Like somehow I'm going to do
something idiotic and irresponsible.

39
00:03:12,254 --> 00:03:18,249
Hey, look at this. Some kid fell asleep at a frat
party and another kid glued his face to the floor.

40
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,467
Can you imagine what that looked like?

41
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,618
Just regular old Super Glue.
We've got a ton of that stuff in our garage.

42
00:03:26,641 --> 00:03:28,533
Where do people get these ideas?

43
00:03:32,349 --> 00:03:34,529
Mother, I was getting the door for you.

44
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:36,651
I don't need your pity! I'm fine!

45
00:03:36,652 --> 00:03:39,633
No, you are not fine.
You need to relax.

46
00:03:39,634 --> 00:03:43,086
If you keep thrashing around, the
doctor says it'll make your leg bleed again.

47
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:48,996
Ha! Scare tactics those butchers tell you so you'll
get weak and they can sell you more go-go pills.

48
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,714
There... and there.

49
00:03:52,212 --> 00:03:56,369
I helped get her moved back in and I spent
some time in her place. My obligation is fulfilled.

50
00:03:56,632 --> 00:03:57,370
Have fun you two.

51
00:03:57,371 --> 00:03:59,896
Get back in here. We are not
having this argument again.

52
00:03:59,897 --> 00:04:03,211
Let him go. It's the little one that owes me his life.

53
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,872
See, even she thinks so.

54
00:04:05,293 --> 00:04:10,518
Francis, everyone elsen in this family has either school or a job.
So you're staying here and helping your grandmother.

55
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:11,791
I don't need help.

56
00:04:12,151 --> 00:04:15,817
Look at him. He has nothing between his legs and he manages.

57
00:04:15,818 --> 00:04:20,076
- If you think I'm above punching you, you are totally wrong.
- Of course you'd hit a cripple.

58
00:04:20,263 --> 00:04:22,606
You couldn't even get a white girl to marry you.

59
00:04:22,723 --> 00:04:24,342
Stop it both of you.

60
00:04:24,825 --> 00:04:27,635
Can you go at least five seconds
without screaming at each other?

61
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,166
- I am sick of you!
- You stupid Nancy boy!

62
00:04:32,201 --> 00:04:35,052
- You dried up old hag! If I had been driving that truck myself...
- You ought to strangle yourself...

63
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,972
Well, I wonder which nightmare
I'm going to have tonight.

64
00:04:41,534 --> 00:04:45,179
"The Forest of Severed Legs" or
"Drowning in Grandma's Blood"?

65
00:04:46,397 --> 00:04:46,898
Well, good night.

66
00:04:49,088 --> 00:04:50,736
I'm going to sleep like a baby tonight.

67
00:04:50,853 --> 00:04:51,417
Me, too.

68
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:52,735
Nothing's going to wake me up.

69
00:04:53,147 --> 00:04:53,925
Same here.

70
00:05:00,198 --> 00:05:01,912
Well... good night.

71
00:05:02,017 --> 00:05:02,531
Good night.

72
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:07,424
What's under your pillow?

73
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:08,501
What's under your pillow?

74
00:05:09,211 --> 00:05:11,044
I think we both know what's under these pillows.

75
00:05:11,183 --> 00:05:11,810
I guess we do.

76
00:05:22,257 --> 00:05:23,550
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

77
00:05:23,982 --> 00:05:27,037
I feel great. Ready to start the day.

78
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:27,764
Me, too.

79
00:05:28,516 --> 00:05:30,060
- Think I'll brush my teeth.
- I'll join you.

80
00:05:40,843 --> 00:05:44,475
Jamie, I am not kidding. You have to
the count of three to eat these peas.

81
00:05:44,476 --> 00:05:45,042
One...

82
00:05:46,798 --> 00:05:47,277
Two...

83
00:05:49,361 --> 00:05:49,739
Three!

84
00:05:51,682 --> 00:05:55,062
All right. But one of these days you
are going to learn that I am serious.

85
00:05:57,936 --> 00:06:00,576
Dad, I've been thinking a lot
about Grandma losing her leg.

86
00:06:00,876 --> 00:06:08,472
I mean, Grandma lost her leg saving my life, but she doesn't really
want to talk to me, so I figure the least I can do is honor her leg.

87
00:06:09,176 --> 00:06:13,691
You know, pay it some decent last respects.
Like maybe have a funeral for it or something.

88
00:06:13,692 --> 00:06:17,649
Dewey, you just can't do that. The leg is medical waste.

89
00:06:18,225 --> 00:06:21,726
The hospital has to process it and
do whatever they do with that stuff.

90
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:22,736
How about this?

91
00:06:22,951 --> 00:06:29,661
Tomorrow, we go in the garage and make your
grandmother a peg. You can paint it like a candy cane.

92
00:06:29,975 --> 00:06:31,396
No, I want the leg.

93
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:35,456
You can't get a leg, Dewey.
That's just not going to happen.

94
00:06:37,073 --> 00:06:38,266
Hello, Pathology?

95
00:06:38,736 --> 00:06:41,186
Yes, this is Judy Green from Dr. Weiss' office.

96
00:06:41,596 --> 00:06:44,535
I'm calling about the chop-and-drop
he did Thursday on the old lady.

97
00:06:44,536 --> 00:06:49,351
Listen, Dr. Weiss thinks he may have left his
wedding ring in that leg. He was pretty hammered.

98
00:06:51,005 --> 00:06:52,559
Yeah, again.

99
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:58,658
So anyway, we need to get that leg out of there before the
lawyers come around and do their Monday-morning quarterbacking.

100
00:07:00,724 --> 00:07:05,611
You know what, instead of the usual place,
just send it to my house. I'll give you the address.

101
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:11,528
I don't care if you knew the end of that
Star Trek episode! I didn't and you ruined it!

102
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,645
- You can't let anyone else be happy!
- Shut up, monkey!

103
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:17,968
Anyone with half a brain could see the rocks were alive!

104
00:07:17,969 --> 00:07:19,881
Both of you, stop it!

105
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:24,041
Francis, it does not matter how horribly
you act, you are not getting out of this!

106
00:07:24,248 --> 00:07:26,200
You are stuck here, so suck it up!

107
00:07:26,671 --> 00:07:33,358
And you... you are old and injured and you need his help.
All your yelling and viciousness does not equal physical strength.

108
00:07:33,609 --> 00:07:39,330
You cannot bully a can of soup down off the shelf.
You cannot scream it down. You need his help.

109
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,672
Yeah, you old bat, where's your gratitude?

110
00:07:41,972 --> 00:07:42,302
Francis...

111
00:07:42,732 --> 00:07:45,806
I am not asking you to do this for her,
I'm asking you to do this for me.

112
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:49,424
I am leaving in a few days and I need
to know she's being taken care of.

113
00:07:50,393 --> 00:07:52,609
You have to find some way you can get along with her.

114
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,850
But she's horrible.

115
00:07:54,007 --> 00:07:56,113
I know, I know, but just try.

116
00:07:56,613 --> 00:07:59,419
Find something you have in common,
something you can agree on.

117
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,963
I don't think that's possible.

118
00:08:00,964 --> 00:08:05,327
For God sakes, you both have such huge reservoirs
of hate, you're telling me there's no overlap?

119
00:08:05,862 --> 00:08:07,005
What about boy bands?

120
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,157
Mom, you hate boy bands, right?

121
00:08:09,714 --> 00:08:11,451
They're making a living, give them a break.

122
00:08:11,897 --> 00:08:12,422
You see?

123
00:08:12,423 --> 00:08:16,912
You're not getting out of this so easily.
You stay here and you figure it out right now.

124
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,661
Hey, Ida, don't you hate how bossy my mom is?

125
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:30,460
Oh God, she's awful. Always ordering me around, making me
jump through hoops for her like every day is her birthday.

126
00:08:30,556 --> 00:08:34,704
And God forbid you forget her birthday.
Then it's martyr time for the next five weeks.

127
00:08:34,705 --> 00:08:37,823
And for what? Everyone knows
it's a made-up holiday anyway.

128
00:08:37,824 --> 00:08:40,322
And those stupid cards? Money in the garbage.

129
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:45,898
Oh, God yes! What a scam. It's like, "La-la, I'm old,
so here's a stupid cartoon with boobs on it."

130
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:46,742
Exactly.

131
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:53,330
No one really remembers the day they had their child.
They pretend they do to feel important.

132
00:09:00,067 --> 00:09:02,001
I haven't slept in two days.

133
00:09:03,118 --> 00:09:06,075
I cut school just to have some
time in the house without Reese.

134
00:09:07,703 --> 00:09:10,530
I just need an hour. A half hour.

135
00:09:10,862 --> 00:09:17,302
Any sleep at all, then I'll have a jump on him.
You can't win this on strength. You've got to win it on planning.

136
00:09:30,815 --> 00:09:32,046
You saved yourself this time.

137
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:33,644
But your reactions will get slower.

138
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,097
And I'll be waiting.

139
00:10:57,807 --> 00:11:00,470
Wait! Reese, wait! This is so stupid.

140
00:11:00,578 --> 00:11:02,399
We're both ruining our lives over it.

141
00:11:02,589 --> 00:11:04,546
I got a "B" on my History midterm.

142
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:06,285
I fell asleep beating up a kid.

143
00:11:06,396 --> 00:11:08,505
- We have to stop this.
- I totally agree.

144
00:11:08,983 --> 00:11:09,592
Okay.

145
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:10,788
Truce?

146
00:11:11,527 --> 00:11:12,135
Truce.

147
00:11:16,734 --> 00:11:19,724
She wears a size 8½ shoe just like me. Why, Dewey?

148
00:11:19,855 --> 00:11:21,420
Just checking. Thanks, Mom.

149
00:11:27,549 --> 00:11:30,288
Okay. Prince Charming looking for Cinderella.

150
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:32,723
That's all it is.

151
00:11:39,046 --> 00:11:43,720
- Grandma, hold still. I can't re-dress your wound until I clean it.
- Your breath is disgusting.

152
00:11:44,155 --> 00:11:46,851
Do you see what I'm doing, and you're complaining about ?

153
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,645
I will go brush my teeth as soon as I'm done.

154
00:11:56,248 --> 00:11:59,024
We are gathered here today to pay tribute to...

155
00:11:59,781 --> 00:12:00,722
a leg.

156
00:12:01,544 --> 00:12:02,485
A leg that saved me.

157
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:07,739
But also kicked me, and stomped on
my toes a lot. But that wasn't your idea.

158
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:11,020
Anyway, uh...

159
00:12:13,785 --> 00:12:18,465
I'm sorry. I just thought once I had the hole and the
severed leg in front of me the words would come naturally.

160
00:12:22,995 --> 00:12:24,397
Dad, what are you doing home?

161
00:12:24,398 --> 00:12:28,804
Dewey, I know you need your time alone, but I did
something I think is gonna make you feel a lot better.

162
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:30,385
Actually, I'm kind of busy right now.

163
00:12:30,386 --> 00:12:34,082
I kept thinking, "There must be some way
I can help take little Dewey's mind off all this".

164
00:12:34,261 --> 00:12:37,887
"There must be some way I can put the fun back in his life."

165
00:12:38,483 --> 00:12:43,233
Of course, your mom is probably going to hit the roof
when she finds out, but you just let me handle that, huh?

166
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:44,676
<i>Dad, what are you talking about?</i>

167
00:12:45,027 --> 00:12:51,024
I'm talking about a lovable furry playmate who you
can spend years with, frolicking and... Oh, my God!

168
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:53,608
- What the hell is he eating?
- What is who eating?

169
00:12:53,677 --> 00:12:54,503
Your dog!

170
00:12:54,689 --> 00:12:57,075
You have him for two seconds and this is what happens?!

171
00:12:57,144 --> 00:12:58,566
I didn't ask for a dog!

172
00:12:58,842 --> 00:13:02,192
- Who brings a dog to a leg funeral?!
- A leg funeral?!

173
00:13:02,306 --> 00:13:04,761
- Dewey, after I said ?
- You didn't say not to,

174
00:13:04,938 --> 00:13:07,691
you just said I wouldn't be able to!

175
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:14,862
This is me with your Uncle Vlad.

176
00:13:15,022 --> 00:13:17,156
This is the only picture of him sober.

177
00:13:17,638 --> 00:13:19,382
And there's Cousin Rega.

178
00:13:19,451 --> 00:13:21,906
You smile at her, she jumps into bed with you.

179
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:24,669
And what's wrong with this person?
What was his moral failing?

180
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:26,784
My dear old friend, Peter.

181
00:13:26,983 --> 00:13:30,356
Look at him, holding a menu like he could read.

182
00:13:30,716 --> 00:13:35,649
- Wait, who's that little girl with you and Grandpa?
- Oh, Mom, don't you want to watch the news?

183
00:13:35,718 --> 00:13:38,081
Who's that little girl? That's you, you big sissy!

184
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:41,585
This was the time your mother sent you to live with us.

185
00:13:41,677 --> 00:13:42,142
What?

186
00:13:42,175 --> 00:13:44,144
Come on. It wasn't "to live" with you.

187
00:13:44,145 --> 00:13:46,312
It was six months. It felt like forever.

188
00:13:46,656 --> 00:13:48,859
We put you in a dress because you wouldn't pee like a boy.

189
00:13:50,356 --> 00:13:51,571
I don't remember any of this!

190
00:13:51,572 --> 00:13:56,241
And you never paid me for the food he ate.
Oh, God, what whining; "I want my Mommy.

191
00:13:56,242 --> 00:14:00,357
Where's my family, Ooh, you're scaring me!" Blah, blah, blah.

192
00:14:00,649 --> 00:14:01,382
What's going on?

193
00:14:01,544 --> 00:14:09,610
Francis, it was a very difficult time. Your father was changing jobs, and then
Reese came along. He was like a whole pack of wolves by himself. It was just too much.

194
00:14:09,742 --> 00:14:14,940
You were a horrible child. You tore a huge gash in
your side trying to get out through the window.

195
00:14:15,406 --> 00:14:19,493
- That's what this is from?
- You cried like a baby when I tried to sew you up.

196
00:14:19,816 --> 00:14:21,035
I was a baby!

197
00:14:21,409 --> 00:14:24,014
You dumped me off and you left me with this monster?!

198
00:14:24,015 --> 00:14:29,478
- Francis, it's not the way you're thinking. You don't even remember it.
- No, but you know what? It's good to know.

199
00:14:29,553 --> 00:14:33,515
It's really nice to know that as a toddler,
your own mother couldn't wait to get rid of you.

200
00:14:33,662 --> 00:14:35,652
- Francis...
- Actually, I should thank you.

201
00:14:35,912 --> 00:14:40,609
'Cause you waited till I was 15 before you kicked me
out for good. That must have been so hard for you.

202
00:14:40,752 --> 00:14:43,149
You can't judge me for this. You weren't there.

203
00:14:43,302 --> 00:14:44,540
 And whose fault was that?!

204
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:48,890
How did you get in here?
Nobody liked looking at you when you were alive.

205
00:14:52,678 --> 00:14:54,756
Okay... what's going on?

206
00:14:55,194 --> 00:14:58,991
Look, I got into this thing with Reese and it's way out of hand.

207
00:14:59,222 --> 00:15:07,575
I haven't slept in three days. If you could just do me a favor, just be on lookout for Reese.
If I can get one hour of sleep, then I can have the upper hand and I can end this.

208
00:15:07,985 --> 00:15:10,387
- Okay.
- Thank you.

209
00:15:12,897 --> 00:15:15,944
Wait a minute.
Why'd you say okay?

210
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:19,637
- What?
- I mean, I just told you and you said okay like it wasn't a big deal.

211
00:15:19,709 --> 00:15:21,896
It seems like you'd at least want to think about it for a little bit.

212
00:15:22,899 --> 00:15:26,556
Unless this was a setup. That's what this is, isn't it?

213
00:15:27,598 --> 00:15:31,757
-What's going on in here? What are you guys up to?
-Oh, nice cover. You two have a side deal!

214
00:15:31,793 --> 00:15:32,175
No!

215
00:15:32,176 --> 00:15:34,733
Or maybe you're just trying to make me think we have a side deal.

216
00:15:35,192 --> 00:15:37,026
- Why would I do that?
- Exactly!

217
00:15:37,266 --> 00:15:41,068
Don't try to make me think that you're
confused, because I know you aren't.

218
00:15:41,578 --> 00:15:44,010
- Why would I want you to think that?!
- Because...

219
00:15:44,722 --> 00:15:46,953
There's some angle that I'm not seeing, but I'll get it.

220
00:15:46,991 --> 00:15:48,383
- Nice bluff!
- Nice fake-out!

221
00:15:48,539 --> 00:15:53,741
Oh, yeah? Well, you can play all the smart games
you want, but I'm not gonna let you get away with it.

222
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:57,222
I'll glue my own face to the floor! Then what are you gonna do, huh?

223
00:15:57,278 --> 00:16:00,572
That'd be the perfect way to make me let my guard down, wouldn't it?!

224
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:18,765
Stevie,

225
00:16:19,176 --> 00:16:21,272
I know you'll be mature enough,

226
00:16:21,871 --> 00:16:23,405
not to do anything,

227
00:16:24,266 --> 00:16:25,351
I would do...

228
00:16:32,836 --> 00:16:36,840
Come on, Champion. Come on, boy.
You don't want that nasty old leg, do you?

229
00:16:37,626 --> 00:16:40,508
- Okay, just kidding. Sorry.
- Dad, he's ruining it!

230
00:16:40,658 --> 00:16:43,577
- Throw another steak in there.
- I am not going to waste another steak.

231
00:16:43,652 --> 00:16:46,234
He's not going for it, and it was $12 a pound.

232
00:16:46,343 --> 00:16:49,355
It was not! It was bargain meat, and he knows the difference.

233
00:16:49,402 --> 00:16:50,845
I am doing my best here, son.

234
00:16:52,668 --> 00:16:54,165
Oh, boy.

235
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:56,073
He's gonna finish the whole thing!

236
00:16:56,373 --> 00:16:59,816
- Call 911!
- Dewey, what part of thislooks like authorities should be involved?

237
00:17:00,636 --> 00:17:04,491
God, if only your grandmother wasn't so damned tasty.

238
00:17:06,699 --> 00:17:08,682
Now there's no way to feel better.

239
00:17:09,094 --> 00:17:11,414
Now I have to feel bad forever.

240
00:17:11,601 --> 00:17:13,248
Oh, Dewey.

241
00:17:14,895 --> 00:17:17,178
Maybe you can try and think about it this way.

242
00:17:17,657 --> 00:17:19,304
Your grandmother...

243
00:17:19,977 --> 00:17:27,912
She is the most horrible woman who ever lived, but even she understands
the difference between a life that's been lived and a life with potential.

244
00:17:28,772 --> 00:17:30,457
You want to pay her back?

245
00:17:30,943 --> 00:17:33,076
Live up to that potential.

246
00:17:34,399 --> 00:17:37,581
And if you think about it, you might have done her a big favor.

247
00:17:38,104 --> 00:17:41,697
Let's face it. Saving your life is her
only chance of getting into heaven.

248
00:17:42,072 --> 00:17:46,001
Which isn't going to make you that popular
in heaven, but we'll deal with that later.

249
00:17:46,338 --> 00:17:47,498
Okay.

250
00:17:50,601 --> 00:17:51,724
Hey, Dad?

251
00:17:52,322 --> 00:17:54,680
Is it okay if we don't keep the dog?

252
00:17:55,242 --> 00:17:57,001
Yeah, that sounds fair.

253
00:17:59,059 --> 00:18:04,298
- Grandma, you have to sit still or I can't get the bandage on.
- Just keep your eyes on the stump, Romeo.

254
00:18:06,264 --> 00:18:07,424
Well,

255
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:08,809
okay...

256
00:18:09,108 --> 00:18:11,466
I put all the doctors' numbers on the fridge.

257
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:15,658
The safety rail is up in the shower.

258
00:18:17,379 --> 00:18:18,614
Thank you, Francis.

259
00:18:25,439 --> 00:18:27,647
- I have to tell you something.
- What?

260
00:18:28,582 --> 00:18:31,764
I wasn't a good enough mother to you and I'm sorry.

261
00:18:33,223 --> 00:18:34,945
I shouldn't have left you with her,

262
00:18:35,806 --> 00:18:37,939
and I shouldn't have sent you to military school.

263
00:18:39,191 --> 00:18:44,543
I got overwhelmed and I took things out on you that
weren't your fault. They were my fault, and I'm sorry.

264
00:18:47,499 --> 00:18:48,697
But?

265
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:55,303
But nothing. I'd like to think I was a little bit better with the
other boys, but that's just further proof that you got a terrible deal.

266
00:18:55,377 --> 00:18:58,035
Yes, boo-hoo for the boy with two legs.

267
00:18:59,532 --> 00:19:03,012
You deserved a mother who was more patient and more caring,

268
00:19:05,413 --> 00:19:08,332
and it breaks my heart that you didn't get that mother.

269
00:19:13,684 --> 00:19:15,593
Thank you. Wow.

270
00:19:16,834 --> 00:19:17,732
Wow.

271
00:19:19,903 --> 00:19:20,689
Wow.

272
00:19:22,597 --> 00:19:25,591
I've just waited so many years to hear you say that.

273
00:19:27,618 --> 00:19:29,227
Why don't I feel better?

274
00:19:29,714 --> 00:19:30,537
What do you mean?

275
00:19:30,949 --> 00:19:39,070
I mean, I actually had fantasies where you said that, pretty much
word-for-word. It's spooky how close it is, but it's not helping.

276
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:40,605
Why didn't it help?!

277
00:19:40,962 --> 00:19:46,980
- You want me to say something else?
- No, no, I mean, you said everything!
Anything else would just be fake.

278
00:19:47,489 --> 00:19:52,789
I mean, that was like the perfect thing, and
I am still filled with all this resentment.

279
00:19:53,638 --> 00:20:00,494
Oh, my God, this sucks! That was, like, the one
thing I was living for and it's just... not working at all!

280
00:20:00,614 --> 00:20:05,764
- Can you take the soap opera outside?
I want to watch the whore that gives the weather.
- Mother, please!

281
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:11,834
- Just try to breathe.
- No! You can't just have your life dream stripped
away from you and be okay about it!

282
00:20:12,223 --> 00:20:14,858
- Do you want a cold washcloth?
- I don't think so.

283
00:20:14,888 --> 00:20:18,061
- I don't know. I don't know what I want.
- Do you want me to give you some money?

284
00:20:19,349 --> 00:20:20,576
How much money?

285
00:20:22,127 --> 00:20:24,313
I have $200. I only need $30 for the bus.

286
00:20:25,301 --> 00:20:26,199
Okay.

287
00:20:27,199 --> 00:20:27,702
Here.

288
00:20:29,582 --> 00:20:30,900
And the Tic Tacs.

289
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:35,777
Okay, honey, just remember that I love you.

290
00:20:35,867 --> 00:20:40,358
- In my own imperfect, bad mothering way, I do love you.
- I love you, too.

291
00:20:44,729 --> 00:20:45,926
I'll call you.

292
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:53,112
Okay, Rockefeller, it's lotion time. Cut your nails.

293
00:21:03,747 --> 00:21:05,397
Jennifer, cut it out!

294
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,097
