1
00:00:07,382 --> 00:00:08,166
Oh, my God.

2
00:00:08,348 --> 00:00:08,764
What?

3
00:00:09,051 --> 00:00:09,840
Did you see this?

4
00:00:10,363 --> 00:00:11,343
Look what Jamie wrote.

5
00:00:12,394 --> 00:00:13,984
Oh, my God.

6
00:00:13,985 --> 00:00:15,288
He knows his letters.

7
00:00:15,408 --> 00:00:17,250
There are actual words here.

8
00:00:17,466 --> 00:00:21,487
I mean, it's crude, and it's not clear what
he's communicating, but Jamie is a genius.

9
00:00:21,583 --> 00:00:22,614
There's my homework!

10
00:00:24,355 --> 00:00:24,855
What?

11
00:00:25,202 --> 00:00:26,536
I do my homework once in a while.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Malcolm in the Middle - 6.10 - Billboard

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Synchronisation par Mark & Tyno,
Script original par Raceman.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Forom.com, Life-is-Unfair.tk
& Malcolm-France.com

15
00:01:03,453 --> 00:01:08,821
Once every six months, Mom wakes us up at 5 a.m., shoves
us into the car and makes us go to the outlet stores.

16
00:01:08,971 --> 00:01:12,330
I tell you, I am never disappointed in Value Village.

17
00:01:12,367 --> 00:01:15,217
No other place in the county has
such a selection of irregulars.

18
00:01:15,881 --> 00:01:18,758
Are these made in some country
where people aren't symmetrical?

19
00:01:18,759 --> 00:01:19,605
<i>Stop complaining.</i>

20
00:01:19,739 --> 00:01:22,779
If it weren't for Value Village, most of this family
would have to run around naked.

21
00:01:23,058 --> 00:01:25,647
That place is all that separates us from the apes.

22
00:01:36,931 --> 00:01:38,720
Oh, for crying out loud.

23
00:01:38,721 --> 00:01:40,661
What? I was not! You look great!

24
00:01:41,304 --> 00:01:44,245
The Paysons Outlet has 48-packs
of paper towels for half price.

25
00:01:44,246 --> 00:01:45,800
I wish we had more room in this car.

26
00:01:45,931 --> 00:01:47,543
I knew we should have put the rack on top...

27
00:01:48,493 --> 00:01:49,581
What's wrong with all of you?

28
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:53,200
We're just thinking about all
those towels, honey. I mean...

29
00:01:53,451 --> 00:01:55,149
You're not the only one who loves a bargain.

30
00:02:02,259 --> 00:02:03,052
- Come on!
- What are you doing?

31
00:02:03,135 --> 00:02:04,660
Saving your minds from turning into mush.

32
00:02:04,661 --> 00:02:06,970
You've been sitting on that
couch watching TV for hours.

33
00:02:07,074 --> 00:02:08,255
So what? There's nothing else to do.

34
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:10,071
There's never anything to do around here.

35
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:14,069
Because you have no imaginations, because
you sit in front of that idiot box all day long.

36
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:14,850
<i>Your mother's right.</i>

37
00:02:14,973 --> 00:02:19,166
It's a sad day when three healthy boys can't think
of anything to do with a beautiful Saturday.

38
00:02:19,296 --> 00:02:23,080
You could take a walk, you could roll a hoop,
you can start a rock collection. There.

39
00:02:23,192 --> 00:02:25,793
That's three ideas in five seconds.
I hope you're embarrassed.

40
00:02:25,794 --> 00:02:27,718
You boys have no idea how lucky you are.

41
00:02:27,806 --> 00:02:30,428
The day will come where you won't be able
to complain about having nothing to do.

42
00:02:30,429 --> 00:02:34,269
<i>That's right. You'll have responsibilities
and a career and children.</i>

43
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:37,338
And then you'll ask yourself,
"Hey, where's my boredom now?"

44
00:02:37,339 --> 00:02:39,187
All right, all right, just stop lecturing us!

45
00:02:40,999 --> 00:02:43,384
God forbid those three should
have to make their own fun.

46
00:02:50,456 --> 00:02:54,921
I hate to admit it, but Mom challenged us to use
our creativity, and I think we're better for it.

47
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:57,052
How much time do we have
before the lights come on?

48
00:02:57,493 --> 00:02:58,500
We've got a few minutes.

49
00:02:59,282 --> 00:03:03,918
Let's give her crazy eyes, Dracula
fangs, and a giant fart cloud.

50
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:04,973
Eh. Feels done.

51
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:06,850
We went to all the trouble to get up here.

52
00:03:06,851 --> 00:03:08,006
Let's really think about...

53
00:03:08,987 --> 00:03:09,389
Reese!

54
00:03:11,764 --> 00:03:12,738
What are you writing?

55
00:03:13,503 --> 00:03:15,454
"I want Reese."

56
00:03:16,021 --> 00:03:17,675
Come on. You know she's thinking it.

57
00:03:17,977 --> 00:03:20,079
How are we supposed to get away
with this if you put your name up there?

58
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,960
Relax. We're miles from our house.

59
00:03:22,273 --> 00:03:23,280
Nobody here knows us.

60
00:03:35,456 --> 00:03:37,126
Oh, my God!

61
00:03:38,059 --> 00:03:39,146
Did you hear something?

62
00:03:39,147 --> 00:03:41,240
<i>What are you boys doing up there?</i>

63
00:03:41,241 --> 00:03:41,600
It's Mom!

64
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:44,236
How'd she know where to find us?

65
00:03:44,237 --> 00:03:46,698
I told you she's got tracking devices in our feelings!

66
00:03:46,928 --> 00:03:49,850
If you two geniuses had ripped them out
like I did, we wouldn't be in this mess!

67
00:03:50,003 --> 00:03:52,189
- Maybe she didn't see us.
- Reese, Malcolm, Dewey!

68
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:54,316
You get down here this instant!

69
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:57,294
Missus, I don't know who you are thinking we are.

70
00:03:57,551 --> 00:04:00,637
Your boys are very different boys than we are being.

71
00:04:01,947 --> 00:04:02,263
Oh, no!

72
00:04:03,591 --> 00:04:04,821
Where's the back door on this thing?

73
00:04:04,981 --> 00:04:06,386
It's a billboard!

74
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:07,694
We are so dead!

75
00:04:07,971 --> 00:04:09,157
This time she'll finish us!

76
00:04:09,448 --> 00:04:10,450
What are we gonna do?!

77
00:04:10,556 --> 00:04:11,778
Oh, God! Oh, God!

78
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:14,011
Why do billboards have to be so visible?

79
00:04:14,348 --> 00:04:16,292
Come down now!

80
00:04:16,599 --> 00:04:17,600
Reese, give me your pocket knife.

81
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:21,119
Okay... But if you miss her,
you'll only make her madder.

82
00:04:26,374 --> 00:04:27,081
What are you doing?

83
00:04:27,277 --> 00:04:28,691
Hold on. I know that look.

84
00:04:29,042 --> 00:04:29,998
He's using his brain.

85
00:04:32,945 --> 00:04:34,723
We can't come down because we are...

86
00:04:35,263 --> 00:04:38,052
protesting this offensive depiction of women!

87
00:04:38,468 --> 00:04:39,168
What?!

88
00:04:39,339 --> 00:04:39,766
What?!

89
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:42,530
We've come up here to make
a difference in the world!

90
00:04:43,123 --> 00:04:43,607
Yeah!

91
00:04:43,608 --> 00:04:46,877
To speak for women like this one
who can't speak for themselves!

92
00:04:46,878 --> 00:04:49,098
Yeah, because they're billboards!

93
00:04:49,099 --> 00:04:49,703
Shut up.

94
00:04:50,358 --> 00:04:53,400
We're not coming down until women
everywhere get the respect they deserve!

95
00:04:53,819 --> 00:04:57,102
No matter how long it takes,
we're staying up here!

96
00:04:57,447 --> 00:05:01,250
Oh, for the love of God. I don't know
who you think you're fooling.

97
00:05:01,251 --> 00:05:05,951
- It's about time!
- Thank you, boys!
- God bless you!

98
00:05:08,129 --> 00:05:08,585
<i>Oh, no.</i>

99
00:05:08,586 --> 00:05:09,758
She's talking to the cops.

100
00:05:09,928 --> 00:05:10,691
Wait, that's good.

101
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:13,251
If she gets ahold of us, she'll
have to beat us within the law.

102
00:05:13,522 --> 00:05:15,641
All these people showing up is
making her madder and madder.

103
00:05:16,097 --> 00:05:17,965
Why didn't we just climb down right away?

104
00:05:18,407 --> 00:05:19,450
What were you thinking?

105
00:05:19,451 --> 00:05:20,501
I don't know. I panicked.

106
00:05:20,966 --> 00:05:23,687
I want to know what you're
going to do to get my boys down.

107
00:05:23,818 --> 00:05:29,718
It's a complicated situation, ma'am. We have very specific
guidelines for how to deal with political protesters.

108
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:31,724
They're not political protesters.

109
00:05:31,982 --> 00:05:33,953
Those boys don't give a damn about women's rights!

110
00:05:33,954 --> 00:05:36,889
If they did, they'd clean up their rooms once in a while!

111
00:05:37,325 --> 00:05:38,694
This is hooliganism!

112
00:05:38,834 --> 00:05:39,900
Sorry it took me so long.

113
00:05:39,901 --> 00:05:41,737
Eight different baby-sitters turned me down.

114
00:05:42,005 --> 00:05:43,447
Do you know Jamie's on a website?

115
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:44,351
Where are the boys?

116
00:05:44,352 --> 00:05:45,348
I told you.

117
00:05:46,116 --> 00:05:47,568
Oh, good God!

118
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:49,307
I thought it was a metaphor.

119
00:05:49,584 --> 00:05:53,588
I'm sure you have ladders.
I'm sure you have people who climb them.

120
00:05:54,016 --> 00:05:57,805
So get one of them up there
and get my children down!

121
00:05:57,806 --> 00:06:00,279
Ma'am, let me explain something
about the Police Commissioner.

122
00:06:00,524 --> 00:06:01,766
This is an election year.

123
00:06:01,842 --> 00:06:04,628
We've had a lot of unflattering
video on the news lately.

124
00:06:04,629 --> 00:06:10,194
The Chang case, the Jefferson case, the Rodriguez case.
All he has left is the white vote.

125
00:06:10,758 --> 00:06:14,450
So he's not going to let a bunch of video
cameras tape us manhandling those children.

126
00:06:15,072 --> 00:06:16,931
But if there's anything else
that we can do for you...

127
00:06:16,932 --> 00:06:18,497
Yeah, how about you call a cop?

128
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,988
Sorry, Officer.
It's not you, it's me.

129
00:06:21,155 --> 00:06:24,800
I have a severe gambling problem.
Lost the house playing Pai-Gow.

130
00:06:24,904 --> 00:06:26,750
She's a saint.
Would you excuse us a moment?

131
00:06:27,063 --> 00:06:28,123
Honey, calm down.

132
00:06:28,124 --> 00:06:29,637
You know what pepper spray feels like.

133
00:06:29,938 --> 00:06:31,354
Let's just give it an hour or two.

134
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:35,523
When these people lose interest and the
crowd disperses, we'll get the boys down.

135
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:44,197
That's right, Steven. I'm here at the scene
of this dramatic demonstration...

136
00:06:44,198 --> 00:06:48,323
In an age of cynicism when it's said that
young people don't care about the important issues...

137
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:54,700
These three youngsters seem to have struck a nerve among like-minded
citizens who've had enough of this degrading depiction of women.

138
00:06:55,446 --> 00:06:57,643
Lois, did you see all the news vans?

139
00:06:57,845 --> 00:07:00,326
Lyle at Seven told me to get out of his shot.

140
00:07:01,189 --> 00:07:02,346
He is one handsome man.

141
00:07:02,788 --> 00:07:05,762
Over here we have the proud mother
of these three young protesters.

142
00:07:05,763 --> 00:07:08,108
What do you want the nation
to know about your boys?

143
00:07:08,835 --> 00:07:09,600
No comment.

144
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,873
So you must be the father?
Can we get some comment from you?

145
00:07:15,033 --> 00:07:17,314
I, I don't know that
I really want to sound off.

146
00:07:17,543 --> 00:07:21,245
How do you account for your sons'
extraordinary sensitivity to women's issues?

147
00:07:22,335 --> 00:07:25,600
Well, Dinah, in our house we
emphasize the rights of all people.

148
00:07:25,972 --> 00:07:29,299
I've tried to pass along what
I like to call "core values."

149
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:33,129
Equality, respect, compassion, nutrition.

150
00:07:34,343 --> 00:07:36,497
We have something called
the Clean Plate Club.

151
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:40,242
What's that cop doing?

152
00:07:40,739 --> 00:07:42,030
I think he's throwing something.

153
00:07:42,064 --> 00:07:42,693
Oh my God!

154
00:07:45,675 --> 00:07:46,371
What is it?

155
00:07:46,834 --> 00:07:47,729
It's a cell phone.

156
00:07:50,643 --> 00:07:51,272
Hello.

157
00:07:51,537 --> 00:07:52,331
<i>Hello.</i>

158
00:07:52,497 --> 00:07:52,994
Mom?

159
00:07:53,172 --> 00:07:55,987
Before you say anything, I want you to listen carefully.

160
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,543
<i>There are a couple ways we can handle this.</i>

161
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:01,815
If you come down right now, I can go
as low as three weeks in your room.

162
00:08:02,168 --> 00:08:05,347
If there's no you get two meals a
day and enough light to read by.

163
00:08:05,579 --> 00:08:07,433
You should think about this very carefully,

164
00:08:07,764 --> 00:08:10,447
but you've only got ten minutes until this offer expires.

165
00:08:10,999 --> 00:08:12,820
Then all bets are off.

166
00:08:16,728 --> 00:08:18,218
Oh, my God.

167
00:08:19,344 --> 00:08:20,271
I know.

168
00:08:21,383 --> 00:08:22,874
She's negotiating.

169
00:08:23,867 --> 00:08:26,086
She's never negotiated anything before.

170
00:08:26,218 --> 00:08:27,543
We found a weakness.

171
00:08:28,172 --> 00:08:30,225
All these people and the TV cameras.

172
00:08:31,105 --> 00:08:32,396
She must be scared.

173
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:34,217
I didn't think this was possible.

174
00:08:35,111 --> 00:08:37,065
Suddenly, she looks so small.

175
00:08:39,913 --> 00:08:40,708
People,

176
00:08:41,094 --> 00:08:43,015
the battle before us may be long,

177
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:45,564
but we will not stop
until we end the oppression!

178
00:08:46,094 --> 00:08:47,320
Women of the world...

179
00:08:47,551 --> 00:08:48,147
Unite!

180
00:09:07,089 --> 00:09:09,341
I am their mother, and I say this has gone on long enough!

181
00:09:09,429 --> 00:09:12,343
Don't you have snipers with
tranquilizer guns or a giant net?!

182
00:09:12,674 --> 00:09:16,383
- What do I pay taxes for?
- No, the life of a crusader is not an easy one,

183
00:09:16,582 --> 00:09:19,794
but once that fire is lit, there is no putting it out.

184
00:09:19,982 --> 00:09:22,631
Feminism must be very important &to your boys.

185
00:09:23,856 --> 00:09:26,837
Meryl, please! They're not my "boys." They're my children.

186
00:09:27,135 --> 00:09:29,453
If you feel the need to label them, I'm sorry for you.

187
00:09:29,691 --> 00:09:32,274
It's high time we showed a national audience...

188
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:34,824
This is national?

189
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:41,369
... that we're still producing heroes in this
country, and three of them are up there!

190
00:09:45,622 --> 00:09:46,779
It's your sons, ma'am.

191
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,958
Well, you're cutting it awfully close.

192
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:52,343
I gave you ten minutes, and you've taken nearly nine and a half.

193
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:54,064
We decided we're not coming down.

194
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:55,323
What?!

195
00:09:55,488 --> 00:09:56,515
We discussed it as a family.

196
00:09:56,708 --> 00:10:00,119
See, we figure you're as mad now
as you possibly can ever get.

197
00:10:00,284 --> 00:10:02,636
We've reached the point where nothing
we do can make it any worse.

198
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,384
So every hour we stay up here
is another hour of freedom.

199
00:10:05,903 --> 00:10:09,049
Plus another 30 or 40 supporters added to our fan base.

200
00:10:10,307 --> 00:10:13,255
Malcolm, let's set aside the fact that you know you've done wrong.

201
00:10:13,773 --> 00:10:17,714
Let's ignore that you're pretending to have
principles you don't have just to get out of it.

202
00:10:18,177 --> 00:10:20,197
You have to come down sometime.

203
00:10:20,595 --> 00:10:22,317
And life is long.

204
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:24,005
That's what's nice about being young.

205
00:10:24,172 --> 00:10:25,928
We really don't think that far ahead.

206
00:10:26,226 --> 00:10:27,749
This whole thing's been kind of eye-opening.

207
00:10:28,444 --> 00:10:31,723
If nothing else, we've all had a lesson
on the ephemeral nature of power.

208
00:10:32,153 --> 00:10:33,213
Power's a funny thing.

209
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,652
It's when you think you have it that you're in trouble.

210
00:10:36,016 --> 00:10:36,844
Valid point.

211
00:10:37,175 --> 00:10:37,837
Historically.

212
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,791
But on a philosophical level, Mom...

213
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,149
we've already won.

214
00:10:41,447 --> 00:10:42,043
We're free.

215
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:43,765
And no matter what happens tonight,

216
00:10:44,022 --> 00:10:45,049
we both know it.

217
00:10:58,281 --> 00:10:59,871
I think it's getting cold up here.

218
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,354
I don't think we should do this anymore.

219
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:04,639
I don't know who we think we're kidding.

220
00:11:04,883 --> 00:11:06,970
- We're not going to be able to win this...
- Dewey,

221
00:11:07,003 --> 00:11:08,460
don't look into her eyes!

222
00:11:08,658 --> 00:11:09,089
Huh?

223
00:11:10,082 --> 00:11:11,076
What just happened?

224
00:11:11,473 --> 00:11:12,102
Damn it.

225
00:11:13,096 --> 00:11:15,480
I remember my mother, smart as any man,

226
00:11:15,838 --> 00:11:19,646
down on her knees in the kitchen,
scrubbing that floor 'til it shined.

227
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:23,355
- I think I was seven when I made a
promise to myself and to all women...
- Hal?

228
00:11:23,487 --> 00:11:23,852
Yes.

229
00:11:25,465 --> 00:11:25,961
Oh, my God.

230
00:11:25,994 --> 00:11:30,498
I saw you on TV tonight, and I couldn't believe it was you,

231
00:11:30,531 --> 00:11:33,809
but you kept talking and talking and talking.

232
00:11:33,843 --> 00:11:36,028
And I realized it had to be you.

233
00:11:36,483 --> 00:11:37,245
Wendy...

234
00:11:37,808 --> 00:11:40,343
- How long's it been?
- 23 years, Hal.

235
00:11:40,722 --> 00:11:46,087
You know, I remember the last time I saw you down to the day
and the minute. I can tell you exactly where I was standing...

236
00:11:46,088 --> 00:11:46,446
Wendy!

237
00:11:46,718 --> 00:11:50,427
That was so long ago. I've got a whole new life now.

238
00:11:51,122 --> 00:11:55,229
- You can't just come here and expect...
- Promises were made, Hal.

239
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:58,993
And now that I found you, I'm not just gonna go away.

240
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:04,358
Look, I know that there are some
issues that probably need resolving...

241
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:08,429
Listen, honey, let's get a cup of coffee way over there.

242
00:12:09,091 --> 00:12:10,416
No. I have an idea.

243
00:12:13,187 --> 00:12:14,175
Is this going up to the boys?

244
00:12:14,176 --> 00:12:18,183
Yes, it's some baked goods, some jackets for
when it gets cold... and my phone number.

245
00:12:20,075 --> 00:12:21,697
Oh, this is wonderful.

246
00:12:22,029 --> 00:12:23,419
You certainly went to a lot of trouble.

247
00:12:23,729 --> 00:12:26,345
My boys are just going to be so appreciative of your kindness.

248
00:12:29,988 --> 00:12:34,309
I think the Green Valley Women's Collective makes
better banana bread than the Feminists for Change.

249
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,826
According to the wrapper, we're the first male hands to touch this.

250
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:41,568
You know, except for Mom and Dad and Francis and Jamie,

251
00:12:41,667 --> 00:12:43,654
I think this has really brought our family together.

252
00:12:46,539 --> 00:12:47,267
What are you doing?

253
00:12:47,665 --> 00:12:48,029
What?

254
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:49,420
You know what.

255
00:12:49,817 --> 00:12:51,373
Why do you get the one with the cherry?

256
00:12:51,473 --> 00:12:52,797
I just grabbed one. I don't care.

257
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:54,486
If you don't care, then let me have it.

258
00:12:54,831 --> 00:12:55,824
I already took it.

259
00:12:55,957 --> 00:12:57,977
Hey, I'm here, too. I want the cherry.

260
00:12:58,043 --> 00:12:59,036
You always do this.

261
00:12:59,202 --> 00:13:00,957
You only want it because I have it.

262
00:13:01,023 --> 00:13:02,282
I don't care what you have.

263
00:13:02,845 --> 00:13:04,534
Reese, you're not the center of everything...

264
00:13:06,262 --> 00:13:06,759
Wait.

265
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:10,600
Why would they only put a cherry on one cupcake?

266
00:13:13,183 --> 00:13:14,408
This is Mom.

267
00:13:17,385 --> 00:13:20,961
There may be those who will try to drive a wedge between us.

268
00:13:21,392 --> 00:13:25,167
But if we learn nothing else tonight,
we will learn to stand together!

269
00:13:31,248 --> 00:13:32,043
Damn it.

270
00:13:36,369 --> 00:13:39,098
We have a pretty sweet deal up here.
Food, drinks.

271
00:13:39,262 --> 00:13:41,104
Everyone of our needs is being taken care of.

272
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:42,393
Everyone.

273
00:13:44,095 --> 00:13:46,710
Man, they better stop sending up bran muffins.

274
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,214
Hey! You may want to burn this basket!

275
00:13:51,096 --> 00:13:52,125
How are the books they gave us?

276
00:13:52,557 --> 00:13:56,597
The feminist joke book's a little ham-fisted,
but these fairy tales are interesting.

277
00:13:57,017 --> 00:14:00,658
In this one, Cinderella tells the Prince
he's sapping her woman-strength,

278
00:14:00,659 --> 00:14:04,469
and she pushes him aside to create
a matriarchy with fluid gender roles.

279
00:14:05,426 --> 00:14:08,234
Can you believe these cows
actually think we're on their side ?

280
00:14:08,235 --> 00:14:09,399
<i>We love you, boys!</i>

281
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,582
Right on, sister!

282
00:14:11,122 --> 00:14:12,400
Check out that pig.

283
00:14:13,032 --> 00:14:14,471
You don't have to talk about them like that.

284
00:14:14,752 --> 00:14:16,341
They've been really nice to us.

285
00:14:16,566 --> 00:14:18,237
Yeah, and they really believe in this stuff.

286
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,878
That is such a load.

287
00:14:20,029 --> 00:14:22,494
Every woman down there is just
here because they're jealous.

288
00:14:22,622 --> 00:14:23,265
Of what?

289
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,633
Of the fact that they're not
hot enough to be strippers.

290
00:14:26,415 --> 00:14:30,167
They act like they're all offended, but really
they're just mad about their own giant butts.

291
00:14:30,555 --> 00:14:34,521
Believe me, in their heart of hearts,
every woman wants to be her.

292
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,600
- What about Mom?
- We're not talking about moms.

293
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:38,750
We're talking about women.

294
00:14:39,081 --> 00:14:40,781
So all women want to be strippers?

295
00:14:41,132 --> 00:14:45,633
There are no women in the world who want to
be doctors or lawyers or anything like that?

296
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:47,352
Cut the act, Malcolm.
They can't hear you.

297
00:14:48,032 --> 00:14:50,450
Just because they look like dogs
doesn't mean they hear like dogs.

298
00:14:51,498 --> 00:14:52,967
I'm sleeping on the other side.

299
00:14:54,741 --> 00:14:56,326
Come on, I was just being honest!

300
00:14:57,571 --> 00:14:58,497
So whipped.

301
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:06,112
<i>Where are the heroes who fight for a cause?</i>

302
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:10,632
<i>Who live by the code of their own moral laws?</i>

303
00:15:10,973 --> 00:15:15,350
<i>Who stand up to tyrants and fight the police?</i>

304
00:15:15,719 --> 00:15:19,897
<i>Like Gandhi and Martin and Bobby and Rosa...</i>

305
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,949
<i>And Malcolm and Dewey and Reese?</i>

306
00:15:24,075 --> 00:15:28,650
<i>And Malcolm and Dewey and Reese.</i>

307
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:34,915
<i>Reese?</i>

308
00:15:35,575 --> 00:15:37,110
<i>Reese.</i>

309
00:15:40,157 --> 00:15:40,516
Hi.

310
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:42,681
I've been wanting to talk to you.

311
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:43,949
Really?

312
00:15:44,102 --> 00:15:45,130
Yeah, sugar.

313
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,448
I had to wait for your brothers to go to sleep.

314
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,600
You don't want to share me, do you?

315
00:15:50,187 --> 00:15:51,145
Everyone's mad at me.

316
00:15:51,531 --> 00:15:53,000
Malcolm and Dewey think I'm a jerk.

317
00:15:53,299 --> 00:15:56,743
You're not a jerk. You're just little.

318
00:15:57,362 --> 00:15:59,403
I think you're cute as a bug.

319
00:16:01,044 --> 00:16:02,298
Do you want me to kiss you?

320
00:16:03,106 --> 00:16:05,440
Uh... yes, ma'am.

321
00:16:12,076 --> 00:16:13,328
Wow.

322
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:15,850
Damn tootin' wow.

323
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:20,037
So, will you take off your giant top?

324
00:16:20,497 --> 00:16:22,120
Do you have a giant dollar?

325
00:16:22,121 --> 00:16:24,050
I'll get a whole bunch if you'll come back again.

326
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,915
I'll come back every night if you want.

327
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,124
You're so great.

328
00:16:28,497 --> 00:16:30,139
The girls at school won't even talk to me.

329
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:36,762
Listen, if they're not willing to talk to you or
dance on a pole, they're not really your friends.

330
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:37,837
You don't need them.

331
00:16:38,132 --> 00:16:39,071
You have me.

332
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:40,698
I'm perfect.

333
00:16:41,235 --> 00:16:43,814
I'm the only woman in the world for you, Reese.

334
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:44,703
You are?

335
00:16:44,964 --> 00:16:45,920
Of course.

336
00:16:46,188 --> 00:16:47,626
I'm 60 feet tall.

337
00:16:47,754 --> 00:16:49,653
My skin is five inches thick.

338
00:16:49,876 --> 00:16:54,396
No matter how creepy and insensitive
and thoughtless you are, you can't hurt me.

339
00:16:55,725 --> 00:16:57,258
That's all I ever wanted.

340
00:16:58,407 --> 00:16:59,675
Why aren't all women like you?

341
00:17:00,599 --> 00:17:03,091
Well, I'm not real, sugar.

342
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:03,998
Oh, yeah.

343
00:17:04,284 --> 00:17:10,900
You just dreamed me up as a super-sexy way to face
the fact that you're going to live the rest of your life alone.

344
00:17:11,502 --> 00:17:13,830
But that's not for sure, is it?

345
00:17:13,831 --> 00:17:15,486
And you know the saddest part?

346
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:19,600
You're gonna wake up before you can think
of anything really good to do with me.

347
00:17:20,734 --> 00:17:21,185
Wait.

348
00:17:21,435 --> 00:17:22,640
We can't just give up on this.

349
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:23,615
Wait.

350
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,000
Don't leave me.

351
00:17:26,044 --> 00:17:27,731
Don't leave me!

352
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:38,674
Right now the mother of the protesters is with the Police Commissioner,
pleading for her brave boys whose sacrifice continues to inspire so many.

353
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:40,651
Those boys are like dogs.

354
00:17:40,811 --> 00:17:43,472
I have to get them on their backs
just to reestablish my dominance.

355
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:47,445
Look, this whole protest thing is a lie anyway.
They don't believe a word of it.

356
00:17:47,748 --> 00:17:50,055
If it's an issue of liability, I'll sign any waiver.

357
00:17:50,175 --> 00:17:51,551
Just get them down here!

358
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,482
Do I appear to look concerned?

359
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,400
What?

360
00:17:55,411 --> 00:17:56,605
Yeah, sure, you look concerned.

361
00:17:56,808 --> 00:17:57,551
Oh, thank God.

362
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,100
My handlers say that I don't pull it off.

363
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:01,600
Can't do the mouth.

364
00:18:02,311 --> 00:18:04,352
I want those boys down.

365
00:18:04,851 --> 00:18:10,856
Believe me, there is nothing I would like more
than to tear 'em down and crack a few heads.

366
00:18:11,128 --> 00:18:14,500
But in an election year we all have to make sacrifices.

367
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:18,287
You know, this whole thing brings me
back to my days on the Freedom Ride.

368
00:18:19,253 --> 00:18:21,405
It's fantastic. We're getting an injunction.

369
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,114
What?

370
00:18:22,115 --> 00:18:25,855
The ACLU found a judge who's completely
sympathetic to what your boys are doing.

371
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:31,079
In two hours, we'll have an airtight court order and
your boys can stay up there for days, even weeks.

372
00:18:36,999 --> 00:18:38,725
Excuse me, I have something to say.

373
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:45,300
I want the world to know how proud
I am of my boys for making this statement,

374
00:18:45,635 --> 00:18:49,277
despite the wind and the cold and
little Dewey's medical condition.

375
00:18:49,884 --> 00:18:56,450
And I want to thank the Police Commissioner for letting my son
stay up there, even if it means rolling the dice on a diabetic coma.

376
00:18:57,155 --> 00:19:02,730
It's nice to see someone who cares about principles
more than they care about the life of a little boy.

377
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,329
Get 'em down.

378
00:19:14,044 --> 00:19:14,561
Malcolm!

379
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:15,543
<i>Reese!</i>

380
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:16,716
Oh, my God!

381
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,495
We'll have you in your mother's
arms in a minute, little Dewey!

382
00:19:19,633 --> 00:19:22,100
No!

383
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,978
Excuse me, are you Hal's wife?

384
00:19:23,979 --> 00:19:24,863
Yeah, this is, uh...

385
00:19:24,864 --> 00:19:26,588
There's something you need
to know about your husband.

386
00:19:26,589 --> 00:19:28,573
We both worked at the Tiger Shop at Macy's.

387
00:19:28,687 --> 00:19:30,442
One night he got me drunk and...

388
00:19:31,133 --> 00:19:33,063
borrowed $400 from me!

389
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,034
What?

390
00:19:34,035 --> 00:19:37,550
He bought a velour suit and faked his
own death to get out of paying me back.

391
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:39,314
He actually blew up a phone booth.

392
00:19:40,172 --> 00:19:42,810
I figure with interest it comes to about ten grand.

393
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:43,600
I'm sorry, but...

394
00:19:51,555 --> 00:19:53,318
Hey! Hey, everybody!

395
00:19:53,949 --> 00:19:56,835
You can take us down, but first I have something to say.

396
00:19:59,052 --> 00:20:00,515
I realized something up here.

397
00:20:01,165 --> 00:20:06,180
This woman is beautiful, she's sexy, and
perfect and gigantic, but you know what?

398
00:20:06,687 --> 00:20:07,620
She isn't real.

399
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:11,704
If she was real, she'd be different.

400
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:14,838
I know that if I was real,
I'd want people to listen to me.

401
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:18,100
I'd want people to care about what
I think and not ignore me.

402
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,605
I guess what these protesters are trying to say is,

403
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:25,993
that women, real women, aren't
that different from regular people.

404
00:20:26,545 --> 00:20:28,550
<i>They want the same things that men want.</i>

405
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,836
Only men don't have to hold a big protest to get them.

406
00:20:32,358 --> 00:20:33,760
And women shouldn't have to either.

407
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:43,251
Well, I'm very proud of you boys.

408
00:20:43,252 --> 00:20:45,977
Let's go home where I can truly express how I'm feeling.

409
00:20:47,992 --> 00:20:51,259
I've had six hours to figure out all the horrible
things that are going to happen to you.

410
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:54,215
You, I still have to think about.

411
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,300
Get him to Deaconess Diabetic Center right away.

412
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,864
Dad! Tell them what's going on!

413
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:06,208
- Tell them I'm not...
- He's fading! Let's go! Let's go!

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
