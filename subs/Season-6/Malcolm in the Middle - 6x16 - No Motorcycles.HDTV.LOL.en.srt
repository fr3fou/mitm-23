1
00:00:01,417 --> 00:00:05,666
Boy, when you wet the tip, this thing really cracks.

2
00:00:06,803 --> 00:00:07,980
Hey, would you hold this for me?

3
00:00:09,195 --> 00:00:10,372
What's that on the floor?

4
00:00:10,835 --> 00:00:13,247
The poem I wrote about kittens.

5
00:00:13,494 --> 00:00:14,787
That's so weird.

6
00:00:14,892 --> 00:00:17,632
I guess I have no choice but to bend over...

7
00:00:17,902 --> 00:00:21,124
wearing last year's shorts and pick it up.

8
00:00:26,434 --> 00:00:27,824
He's really sick, Mom.

00:01:03,054 --> 00:01:03,980
They're here.

13
00:01:04,628 --> 00:01:05,400
They're here.

14
00:01:06,565 --> 00:01:09,247
Francis and Piama are spending
the weekend for Francis' birthday.

15
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,732
He's turning 21 tomorrow.

16
00:01:10,829 --> 00:01:14,089
I haven't seen Dad this excited since
he thought Francis turned 21 last year.

17
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:17,830
Hey, it's the birthday boy.
Or should I say birthday man?

18
00:01:18,409 --> 00:01:20,917
I know you said not to bring anything, but I brought a salad.

19
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:23,577
Oh, thank you, Piama. That's so thoughtful.

20
00:01:23,731 --> 00:01:25,836
I'll just take it in the kitchen and rewash it.

21
00:01:27,122 --> 00:01:27,932
Oh...

22
00:01:28,916 --> 00:01:30,691
I am so excited.

23
00:01:31,038 --> 00:01:32,383
Yeah, it's going to be a great party.

24
00:01:32,423 --> 00:01:33,589
No, not the party.

25
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:35,171
The... you know what.

26
00:01:37,237 --> 00:01:37,711
Oh.

27
00:01:38,245 --> 00:01:38,799
Yeah.

28
00:01:38,906 --> 00:01:42,659
Thank you so much. I've been
looking forward to this for 12 years.

29
00:01:42,824 --> 00:01:44,578
12 long years.

30
00:01:46,166 --> 00:01:47,470
Yes, well...

31
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:51,103
it's going to be everything you dreamed it would.

32
00:01:51,181 --> 00:01:53,543
This totally makes the Peter Pan thing worthwhile.

33
00:01:55,487 --> 00:01:56,278
<i>Peter Pan?</i>

34
00:01:56,924 --> 00:01:57,715
<i>Peter Pan.</i>

35
00:01:58,494 --> 00:01:59,420
<i>Peter Pan!</i>

36
00:02:01,887 --> 00:02:05,245
Oh, Francis, please. Oh, God, I am so sorry.

37
00:02:05,276 --> 00:02:07,734
I didn't know your school play was today.

38
00:02:07,735 --> 00:02:10,228
You saw me leave in this costume.

39
00:02:10,247 --> 00:02:14,656
Francis, please, stop crying. I am so sorry.
Look, I'll do anything to make it up to you.

40
00:02:14,811 --> 00:02:16,335
What do you want? I'll do anything.

41
00:02:16,393 --> 00:02:19,521
I want to go on a motorcycle
trip like you always talk about.

42
00:02:19,586 --> 00:02:23,204
Honey, that was way back in college.
And you know how your mother feels...

43
00:02:23,205 --> 00:02:25,863
I want a motorcycle trip with my dad!

44
00:02:26,035 --> 00:02:26,813
Okay. Okay.

45
00:02:26,829 --> 00:02:27,744
I'll tell you what.

46
00:02:28,011 --> 00:02:33,663
When you turn 21, I promise I will take you on
the most awesome, special motorcycle trip, okay?

47
00:02:34,507 --> 00:02:36,466
We'll go when you turn 21.

48
00:02:37,489 --> 00:02:38,588
Oh, yeah.

49
00:02:39,495 --> 00:02:40,286
Motorcycle trip.

50
00:02:40,864 --> 00:02:43,257
At first I thought you were
just saying it to shut me up.

51
00:02:43,942 --> 00:02:46,141
You're just saying this to shut me up.

52
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:48,745
No, son, this is a promise.

53
00:02:48,977 --> 00:02:55,806
On the day of your 21st birthday, I swear by all that is holy,
you and I will go on a father-son motorcycle trip, so help me God.

54
00:02:55,803 --> 00:02:57,616
How are you going to get Mom to let you?

55
00:02:57,654 --> 00:03:01,700
I swear on my life, Francis, nothing will stop this.

56
00:03:02,148 --> 00:03:11,353
This is the holiest, most sacred promise between a father and a son.
Nothing, and I mean nothing, can ever undo this promise!

57
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:16,879
- Boy, I sure liked to nail things down, didn't I?
- Oh, yeah. It's going to be great.

58
00:03:17,869 --> 00:03:18,738
Wait, wasn't there...?

59
00:03:20,956 --> 00:03:22,847
This is sealed in blood.

60
00:03:23,271 --> 00:03:26,608
Do you hear me, son? Sealed in blood.

61
00:03:27,784 --> 00:03:28,942
Oh, crap.

62
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:32,729
Okay, I'll pitch in three dollars
for Francis' birthday present.

63
00:03:32,864 --> 00:03:33,404
Me, too.

64
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,561
And three from me.

65
00:03:34,619 --> 00:03:35,487
So we're agreed.

66
00:03:35,545 --> 00:03:37,442
We're giving Francis nine dollars for his birthday.

67
00:03:38,078 --> 00:03:40,084
Hey, your friend's outside.

68
00:03:41,646 --> 00:03:42,765
What do you mean "friend"?

69
00:03:42,862 --> 00:03:45,756
Your friend, Randy somebody. Really big kid.

70
00:03:46,315 --> 00:03:47,260
Randy Zane?

71
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,192
Yeah, I think he wants to play baseball.

72
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:49,655
What?

73
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:51,450
He's outside right now with his bat.

74
00:03:51,553 --> 00:03:52,769
He seems really impatient.

75
00:03:52,981 --> 00:03:56,087
You know, I told you boys if you just
made an effort you could make friends.

76
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:58,699
You see? You listened to me and it paid off.

77
00:03:58,931 --> 00:04:02,616
Just think how much easier your lives
would be if you listened to me all the time.

78
00:04:05,628 --> 00:04:06,766
God, he looks mad.

79
00:04:07,068 --> 00:04:08,978
Which one of us do you think he wants?

80
00:04:09,113 --> 00:04:10,695
Reese, it's obviously you.

81
00:04:10,907 --> 00:04:13,531
That must've been his bike that
you superglued to the train tracks.

82
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:14,476
We don't know that.

83
00:04:14,697 --> 00:04:17,379
You were pretty fast and loose with
that dog-crap slingshot the other day.

84
00:04:17,572 --> 00:04:18,517
How do you know you didn't hit him?

85
00:04:18,749 --> 00:04:19,424
What about you?

86
00:04:19,761 --> 00:04:22,327
How many people did you convince
to buy those algebra pills?

87
00:04:22,578 --> 00:04:26,166
You know, our lives would be a lot easier if
we didn't all pull this crap at the same time.

88
00:04:26,184 --> 00:04:29,970
I suggested a rotating calendar years ago,
and you guys ignored me. And here we are.

89
00:04:31,032 --> 00:04:32,036
Let's just go tell Mom.

90
00:04:32,132 --> 00:04:32,807
We can't.

91
00:04:33,028 --> 00:04:36,598
If we send Mom out there, Randy will just tell her
what we did, and then they'll both be after us.

92
00:04:36,798 --> 00:04:38,785
Did you see that movie where
Freddie teamed up with Jason?

93
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,943
Is that what you want?

94
00:04:40,078 --> 00:04:41,062
Then what do we do?

95
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:44,063
He can't stand out there forever.
We'll just wait him out.

96
00:04:44,912 --> 00:04:46,648
So what if we have to stay inside for awhile.

97
00:04:49,493 --> 00:04:52,927
- Oh, my God, he's still out there.
- I think he grew.

98
00:04:54,036 --> 00:04:56,312
Why is he smoking two cigarettes?

99
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:58,521
Those are his eyes.

100
00:05:01,877 --> 00:05:03,053
Hal, what are you doing?

101
00:05:03,077 --> 00:05:06,495
I'm just trying to think of some wise
things to say to Francis tomorrow.

102
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:09,465
A father should have some wisdom
for his son, don't you think?

103
00:05:09,872 --> 00:05:12,786
Well, it is a big day. You only turn 21 once.

104
00:05:16,804 --> 00:05:22,360
Hey, remember before he was born
and I had that Harley Da...?

105
00:05:22,361 --> 00:05:24,537
No motorcycles ever!

106
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:26,601
You do not talk about motorcycles.

107
00:05:26,762 --> 00:05:32,048
You do not think, you do not wish, you do not even
reminisce about those stupid, idiotic death traps.

108
00:05:32,173 --> 00:05:35,781
They do not exist. Motorcycles do not exist.

109
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:36,707
Say it.

110
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,648
- Motorcycles do not exist.
- What does not exist?

111
00:05:40,087 --> 00:05:41,515
- I don't know.
- Good.

112
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,508
He was out there all night.

113
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:48,266
- Doesn't he get bored?
- Do sharks get bored?

114
00:05:48,517 --> 00:05:51,334
You know what, we'll just stay
inside all day today, too.

115
00:05:51,584 --> 00:05:52,954
We can last longer than he can.

116
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:55,501
Mmm.

117
00:05:55,516 --> 00:05:58,476
So that's your famous pasta sauce
Francis talks so much about?

118
00:05:58,629 --> 00:06:00,942
Yeah, I only make it for birthdays and acquittals.

119
00:06:01,397 --> 00:06:02,346
One time it was both.

120
00:06:02,643 --> 00:06:04,591
I just love the smell of home cooking.

121
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:05,035
Really?

122
00:06:05,556 --> 00:06:07,562
Do you know there's a way to get
that smell in your own house?

123
00:06:08,828 --> 00:06:10,159
Okay, it's all set up.

124
00:06:10,461 --> 00:06:14,359
The rental place is delivering two motorcycles
to the gas station on 10th and Coolidge.

125
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:18,854
I already have a couple of satchels packed.
At 5:30, we'll just slip out and disappear.

126
00:06:18,835 --> 00:06:20,248
This is so awesome.

127
00:06:20,418 --> 00:06:22,964
So Francis, your birthday dinner starts at 6:00.

128
00:06:23,003 --> 00:06:25,665
- I hope you're hungry.
- Oh, gosh, I sure am.

129
00:06:25,936 --> 00:06:30,578
I'm hungry for all of it. My only problem will be
deciding which amazing side dish to eat first.

130
00:06:30,581 --> 00:06:34,699
But I guess I'll solve that problem at 6:00
'cause that's when my birthday party starts.

131
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,565
Be cool.

132
00:06:45,598 --> 00:06:48,955
We're going to be stuck in here forever.

133
00:06:49,099 --> 00:06:50,209
It'll be fine.

134
00:06:50,527 --> 00:06:53,768
Eventually, he'll get bored,
or tired, or die of starvation.

135
00:06:53,922 --> 00:06:55,379
But who knows how long that could take?

136
00:06:55,765 --> 00:06:58,398
I'm going crazy here. I mean,
look at me, I'm reading a book.

137
00:06:58,682 --> 00:06:59,608
<i>This is dumb.</i>

138
00:06:59,655 --> 00:07:01,044
I'm not going to do this anymore.

139
00:07:01,163 --> 00:07:03,524
I'm just going to go out
and see if it's me he wants.

140
00:07:03,525 --> 00:07:05,678
- What are you, nuts?
- I'm not going to live like this.

141
00:07:05,923 --> 00:07:07,335
I've been beaten before.

142
00:07:07,504 --> 00:07:10,494
I'm just going to get it over with
and live the rest of my life.

143
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:16,194
God, he's walking right up to him.

144
00:07:17,669 --> 00:07:18,691
Randy's hitting him.

145
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:20,533
He's hitting him. It's not us.

146
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:26,722
You know, for a little kid,
he can really take a punch.

147
00:07:27,343 --> 00:07:29,118
I can't believe I've been going so easy on him.

148
00:07:30,545 --> 00:07:32,071
Give me the tape, and I'll get this side.

149
00:07:32,072 --> 00:07:32,906
Oh, I got it.

150
00:07:32,932 --> 00:07:35,908
This tape dispenser is tricky.
It'll take me longer to explain it.

151
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,516
Dewey, are you okay?

152
00:07:45,364 --> 00:07:46,773
Boy, that was a beating.

153
00:07:47,275 --> 00:07:49,648
I mean, no offense to you guys, but "wow."

154
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:51,152
Why did he beat you up? Did he say?

155
00:07:51,268 --> 00:07:52,638
Actually, he said it wasn't me.

156
00:07:53,178 --> 00:07:54,316
Then why'd he eat you up?

157
00:07:54,567 --> 00:07:55,782
He said it was just a warm-up.

158
00:07:56,005 --> 00:07:57,201
Then he said to send out my brother.

159
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:58,783
Which brother, me or Malcolm?

160
00:07:58,976 --> 00:08:00,211
He just said "brother."

161
00:08:01,338 --> 00:08:02,554
Boy, what a weight off.

162
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:06,316
It's just so great to have this
over with. I'm finally free.

163
00:08:06,701 --> 00:08:09,306
And I'm getting some major tooth fairy money.

164
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:15,982
You know, Hal, I realized this afternoon we don't have
any pictures from any of Francis' birthday parties.

165
00:08:16,117 --> 00:08:17,930
I want you to make sure you have
plenty of film in the camera.

166
00:08:18,045 --> 00:08:21,171
Will do. Get ready for a boatload of memories.

167
00:08:21,672 --> 00:08:24,006
Uh, Dad. Can you come out here for a second?

168
00:08:29,538 --> 00:08:30,329
No, no, no, no, no.

169
00:08:30,492 --> 00:08:32,035
These were supposed to go to the gas station.

170
00:08:32,036 --> 00:08:33,000
That's what I'm telling him.

171
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:35,054
Look, this is the address that's on the credit card.

172
00:08:35,055 --> 00:08:36,943
But these can't be anywhere near here.

173
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:38,526
You have to take them to the gas station.

174
00:08:38,545 --> 00:08:41,632
I'm not even insured to touch these
things once they're off the truck.

175
00:08:42,058 --> 00:08:46,494
But you know, you want them taken down
to the gas station, they are motorcycles.

176
00:08:46,495 --> 00:08:48,145
<i>Is everything okay out there, honey?</i>

177
00:08:48,222 --> 00:08:49,881
Fine, no problem.

178
00:08:50,103 --> 00:08:53,439
Francis just wanted to make sure that we
weren't wearing the same outfit tonight.

179
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,042
Okay, just help me get these into the garage.

180
00:08:55,495 --> 00:08:57,135
Wow. Those are cool.

181
00:08:57,235 --> 00:09:04,836
Listen, do not say a word about this. If you just stay quiet, I promise
when you turn 21, I will take you on a trip with me on a rocket ship.

182
00:09:05,183 --> 00:09:06,688
A rocket ship, Dewey.

183
00:09:06,788 --> 00:09:10,810
I swear on my life. I swear on everything
that is sacred, as God is my witness.

184
00:09:12,472 --> 00:09:12,897
Ow.

185
00:09:12,898 --> 00:09:14,747
Oh, how did you...? I don't care.

186
00:09:15,248 --> 00:09:16,676
Francis, come on, quickly.

187
00:09:16,792 --> 00:09:19,203
- How do I...?
- Just kick it into neutral and follow me.

188
00:09:25,699 --> 00:09:27,435
Just turn left and gun it!

189
00:09:35,835 --> 00:09:36,896
<i>I call you later.</i>

190
00:09:37,823 --> 00:09:38,652
<i>I love you.</i>

191
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:47,342
This should have been the greatest day of our lives.

192
00:09:47,381 --> 00:09:50,159
Dad and Francis rode motorcycles through
the living room, and where were we?

193
00:09:50,275 --> 00:09:51,625
Hiding under our beds.

194
00:09:52,155 --> 00:09:54,338
"Oh, I'm really looking forward to dinner."

195
00:09:54,808 --> 00:09:55,734
What a jerk.

196
00:09:55,735 --> 00:09:57,501
I don't know what I'm gonna end up doing to him.

197
00:09:58,025 --> 00:10:01,653
All I know is every stroke of this
brush strengthens my killing arm.

198
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:02,810
Do you have another bucket?

199
00:10:02,906 --> 00:10:05,048
I can get started on the tracks in the living room.

200
00:10:05,067 --> 00:10:07,653
Oh, I'll just end up redoing them all myself anyway.

201
00:10:07,768 --> 00:10:10,180
Why don't you just watch some TV?
Then you'll be out of the way.

202
00:10:11,424 --> 00:10:12,118
Lois!

203
00:10:12,976 --> 00:10:15,793
No one is as useless as you think I am!

204
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:21,973
My focus should be on hating my husband and planning
revenge, not worrying about whether I belong here.

205
00:10:25,882 --> 00:10:27,850
You are absolutely right.

206
00:10:30,072 --> 00:10:30,843
I'm sorry.

207
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:32,531
You deserve better.

208
00:10:34,672 --> 00:10:35,328
Thank you.

209
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:37,199
I appreciate that.

210
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:41,197
So now what?

211
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:44,998
Well, I don't know. We're kind
of in uncharted waters here.

212
00:10:47,821 --> 00:10:49,576
- Drink?
- Absolutely.

213
00:10:51,218 --> 00:10:55,190
Oh, man, what a day. What a ride.

214
00:10:55,357 --> 00:10:57,296
- That was fantastic!
- Yeah.

215
00:10:57,415 --> 00:11:02,273
Just wait. Tomorrow we go around the lake to
this funky old hot springs you are gonna love.

216
00:11:02,369 --> 00:11:05,312
This is the same route I used to
take every month with my buddy, Roy,

217
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:08,966
until he got dragged a quarter mile by that school bus.

218
00:11:09,181 --> 00:11:10,713
Thanks for doing this, Dad.

219
00:11:23,945 --> 00:11:28,778
You know, son, you should always pick
battles that are big enough to matter,

220
00:11:29,113 --> 00:11:31,530
but small enough to win.

221
00:11:32,655 --> 00:11:33,612
Yeah, okay.

222
00:11:42,626 --> 00:11:45,665
I say life is the only real counselor.

223
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,714
Wisdom unfiltered through personal experience
does not become part of the moral tissue.

224
00:11:52,844 --> 00:11:54,208
Dad, you feeling okay?

225
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:56,572
Never mind.

226
00:11:56,907 --> 00:11:59,754
Listen, I have got something really special for you.

227
00:11:59,826 --> 00:12:02,841
You know, it's kind of a father-son
thing to honor the occasion.

228
00:12:02,961 --> 00:12:11,360
It was a little expensive, but I am going to sit with
my 21-year-old son and share a 21-year-old bottle of Scotch.

229
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:14,670
The guy at Liquor Clown said this was the best.

230
00:12:15,675 --> 00:12:18,858
Dad, I'm sorry. I'm sober now.
I don't drink anymore.

231
00:12:19,384 --> 00:12:20,892
- What?
- I'm sober now.

232
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:22,447
I went to AA.

233
00:12:23,261 --> 00:12:24,410
What?

234
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:26,523
When did this happen?

235
00:12:26,595 --> 00:12:29,873
Last year. It just became a problem, and

236
00:12:29,945 --> 00:12:32,649
I kind of bottomed out, so
I decided to get some help, and,

237
00:12:32,745 --> 00:12:34,300
I've been sober
for six months now.

238
00:12:34,444 --> 00:12:36,358
And you didn't tell me about this?

239
00:12:36,454 --> 00:12:37,459
Well, I'm telling you now.

240
00:12:37,539 --> 00:12:42,061
What good is it to tell me now? I'm your father.
You could have come to me about this.

241
00:12:42,157 --> 00:12:45,268
Instead you go to a bunch of
strangers with drinking problems?

242
00:12:45,387 --> 00:12:47,134
Well, I'm sorry... I guess.

243
00:12:47,206 --> 00:12:50,772
Which one of the 12 steps is the one where
you act like your father doesn't exist?

244
00:12:50,843 --> 00:12:53,069
Dad, what's the big deal?
It was my problem.

245
00:12:53,186 --> 00:12:56,871
- I went, and I did what I needed to do to get help.
- I'm supposed to help you.

246
00:12:57,326 --> 00:12:59,264
I deserved to know.

247
00:12:59,575 --> 00:13:06,108
And meanwhile, I plan this whole trip, and now I find out you're sober,
and I'm standing here with a bottle of booze like some kind of jackass.

248
00:13:06,347 --> 00:13:09,387
You know, it's just a little tough... Wow.

249
00:13:09,614 --> 00:13:11,456
It's just little tough to find out.

250
00:13:11,552 --> 00:13:14,878
Do you have any other surprises for me?
Do I have any grandchildren I never met?

251
00:13:14,974 --> 00:13:18,563
- Do you have a boyfriend?!
- Dad, come on. This is a nice trip.

252
00:13:18,635 --> 00:13:20,406
I want to just enjoy this.

253
00:13:20,525 --> 00:13:22,081
I'm going to bed.

254
00:13:27,802 --> 00:13:29,979
I liked the thing you said about picking battles.

255
00:13:30,051 --> 00:13:31,726
I got it off a billboard.

256
00:13:36,369 --> 00:13:40,484
Oh, look at this. You got Francis a watch.

257
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:42,949
That was so nice of you.

258
00:13:45,939 --> 00:13:49,217
This is a rare promotional Doobie Brothers EP.

259
00:13:49,313 --> 00:13:53,573
Oh. Hal almost cried when he found this at a yard sale.

260
00:13:56,931 --> 00:14:02,291
- It still doesn't seem like enough.
- Oh, honey, this is just how we get the creative juices flowing.

261
00:14:02,387 --> 00:14:09,805
It's tough. You have to make your husband miserable, but I have to make
mine miserable  and make it a warning to the other three boys in the house.

262
00:14:09,889 --> 00:14:15,369
- Do men ever think about what's gonna happen
when they do these stupid things?
- No, that's what's weird about men, they never do.

263
00:14:15,488 --> 00:14:20,370
I guarantee you those two won't even think
about the consequences of their actions

264
00:14:20,466 --> 00:14:22,667
until five minutes before they come home.

265
00:14:23,033 --> 00:14:27,077
So no matter how low I set the bar,
he'll still find a way to crawl under it?

266
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:29,637
You still think there's a bar.

267
00:14:29,877 --> 00:14:31,599
That's so cute.

268
00:14:36,849 --> 00:14:40,773
Look at him, sleeping peacefully while
I'm sitting here going through hell.

269
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:43,453
It's not fair.

270
00:14:45,966 --> 00:14:49,699
God, when did this room get so small? I hate this.

271
00:14:49,794 --> 00:14:54,675
- Reese, come on, go to sleep.
- I can't. I just keep thinking about the beating.

272
00:14:54,819 --> 00:14:59,174
How long it'll hurt, how bad
it'll be, when it's gonna happen.

273
00:14:59,413 --> 00:15:03,003
What if it's on the Fourth of July? That'll ruin it.

274
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:07,399
- I was gonna have pie.
- Dude, you have to calm down.

275
00:15:07,518 --> 00:15:10,653
- We can wait it out. We can beat this.
- I can't take this anymore.

276
00:15:10,797 --> 00:15:13,836
I'm going out there. It's probably me he wants, anyway.

277
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:17,521
- Reese, that's stupid. There is no logic in that.
- Yes, there is.

278
00:15:17,616 --> 00:15:22,521
He is just getting madder and madder. And the longer
he has to wait, the worse the beating is going to be.

279
00:15:24,914 --> 00:15:28,408
Reese, think about it. Dewey got beat up
even though Randy wasn't after him.

280
00:15:28,504 --> 00:15:32,284
If you go out there now, he'll beat you up even if you're not
the one he wants, just to send a message to me.

281
00:15:32,365 --> 00:15:33,585
I don't care anymore.

282
00:15:34,184 --> 00:15:36,696
But if you just wait, I'll figure out a way to get out of this.

283
00:15:36,792 --> 00:15:40,429
I am not gonna wait while you keep trying to come up
with some plan that you'll never come up with.

284
00:15:40,501 --> 00:15:42,176
I have to live in the real world.

285
00:16:02,748 --> 00:16:05,237
This mud feels fantastic, doesn't it?

286
00:16:07,053 --> 00:16:13,155
It's so soothing, I don't even care about all
the hundreds of people who left their pubes in here.

287
00:16:15,405 --> 00:16:18,420
Come on, Dad. We should be making the most of this.

288
00:16:18,548 --> 00:16:25,583
You sulked all the way here, you sulked all the way through the
cold plunge, you even sulked when they beat us with juniper branches.

289
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:27,641
Stop being such a baby.

290
00:16:27,761 --> 00:16:31,015
I'm sorry I had such high expectations for this trip.

291
00:16:32,545 --> 00:16:36,685
For all the trouble I went to, I thought maybe
I could maybe be an important part of your life.

292
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:40,872
This has been a nice trip, Dad.
This is exactly how I was hoping it would be.

293
00:16:44,205 --> 00:16:48,841
It just gets to me, Francis. I mean, how did we get to
this point where you're doing all this stuff without me?

294
00:16:48,962 --> 00:16:53,718
I mean, you're-you're traveling everywhere, you're getting
married, you're doing all these things without even telling me.

295
00:16:53,789 --> 00:17:00,648
- And now I find out you even went to AA without telling me?
- I can't help it, Dad. I'm a grown-up now. It happens.

296
00:17:02,823 --> 00:17:03,970
And I missed it.

297
00:17:05,494 --> 00:17:12,185
I mean, here you've grown into this nice, responsible,
decent man, and I didn't get to be there for it.

298
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,101
I missed you being there, too, Dad.

299
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:19,068
It kind of makes me happy you feel sad about it.

300
00:17:20,517 --> 00:17:23,863
- Well, that's something anyway.
- Yeah.

301
00:17:30,435 --> 00:17:31,558
Five minutes.

302
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:36,625
Holy crap, we've got to get back home!
Do you realize how much trouble we're in?

303
00:17:36,702 --> 00:17:38,590
Oh, God, you're right. We're dead. We can't go back.

304
00:17:38,662 --> 00:17:42,605
No, no, no, no, wait. I'll think of something. I've been
married for 20 years, and I've gotten out of a lot of trouble.

305
00:17:43,544 --> 00:17:47,026
- Wait, how is it 20 years if I'm 21?
- Just shut up and let me think.

306
00:17:47,604 --> 00:17:49,649
- Okay. I have something.
- What?

307
00:17:50,517 --> 00:17:53,526
Ow! God. What the hell was that for?

308
00:17:53,574 --> 00:17:56,308
You were in a terrible motorcycle
accident that taught you a lesson.

309
00:17:56,365 --> 00:18:01,260
Now it's not gonna solve everything, but it's gonna make
your apology go down a lot easier because it makes them right,

310
00:18:01,326 --> 00:18:02,856
which is what they really want.

311
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,811
- Dad, you're brilliant.
- There's no time for that. Just do me now.

312
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:09,900
You're gonna want to grab between the second and
third knuckle, and go up and back in one smooth motion.

313
00:18:09,938 --> 00:18:12,003
But just these two so I can still work the throttle.

314
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:17,782
- I love you, Dad.
- I love you, too, son.

315
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:25,137
- You were right, Dewey. I can't tell you how much better I feel.
- Told ya.

316
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:29,395
It's really freeing. Especially knowing
he still wants the other brother.

317
00:18:32,422 --> 00:18:34,901
Malcolm, you got to go out there. It's time. He wants you.

318
00:18:34,978 --> 00:18:37,283
No. By October, I'll be strong enough to beat him.

319
00:18:37,598 --> 00:18:42,686
Come on, Malcolm. You have school tomorrow. You can pretend to
be sick for a few days, but sooner or later, Mom gets involved.

320
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,158
- Then what?
- I'll think of something.

321
00:18:44,324 --> 00:18:48,472
Thinking won't do it, Malcolm. This is
not a smart thing. It's a life thing.

322
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:52,214
Randy is like an earthquake.
It's just something that's gonna happen.

323
00:18:52,429 --> 00:18:55,837
Seriously, Malcolm, the longer you try to put this off,
the worse it's gonna to be.

324
00:18:55,973 --> 00:18:58,673
I could tell he was holding back.
He's got a lot farther he could go.

325
00:18:59,702 --> 00:19:03,386
- This is nothing.
- No, I'm not giving up. I don't give up.

326
00:19:03,576 --> 00:19:08,033
I'm not a quitter. If I have a problem, I think
and work and keep working on it until I solve it.

327
00:19:08,381 --> 00:19:11,275
Okay, name one time that's ever worked out for you.

328
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:12,431
Well... 

329
00:19:12,547 --> 00:19:20,573
Did it work five years ago when your hamster died, and
you spent so many hours giving it CPR that the doctors
had to put a shunt in your mouth to help the sores drain?

330
00:19:20,867 --> 00:19:25,420
Did it work with that girl you kept hounding because you thought
she was so close to liking you until she finally maced you?

331
00:19:26,275 --> 00:19:29,247
No, but I could... I could...

332
00:19:30,648 --> 00:19:33,344
Malcolm, think about it.

333
00:19:36,442 --> 00:19:37,402
You're right.

334
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:40,276
I really have to go out there.

335
00:19:46,517 --> 00:19:48,427
I appreciate you guys looking out for me.

336
00:19:54,231 --> 00:19:56,257
We didn't think you'd be so easy to convince.

337
00:20:10,121 --> 00:20:12,977
No, not him. Where's the red-haired brother?

338
00:20:13,857 --> 00:20:17,755
- There is no red-haired brother. This is it.
- Shoot. I have the wrong house.

339
00:20:19,714 --> 00:20:22,412
Where's that house with the assbag
who works with handicapped kids?

340
00:20:22,488 --> 00:20:25,318
Oh, that's Eddie Jeffers. He lives on Comstock.

341
00:20:28,854 --> 00:20:33,538
You guys got pounded, and I got off scot-free.
Hah! Now whose philosophy looks stupid?

342
00:20:33,614 --> 00:20:35,029
You thought I couldn't come up with...

343
00:20:38,913 --> 00:20:44,234
Guys, wait. What if we do this tomorrow?
You'll be rested. Take some time first.

344
00:20:45,534 --> 00:20:51,170
We worked so hard and spent so much on Francis'
dinner, it's nice that we can all finally enjoy it.

345
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:53,151
More steak, honey?

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
