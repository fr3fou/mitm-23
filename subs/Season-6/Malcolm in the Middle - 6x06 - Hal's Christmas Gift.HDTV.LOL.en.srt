1
00:00:06,377 --> 00:00:07,178
Crap!

2
00:00:20,614 --> 00:00:22,320
Pick. Ass. Oh.

3
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:31,500
Malcolm in the Middle - 6.06 - Hal's Christmas Gift

4
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:39,500
Synchronisation par Mark,
Relecture par Tyno.

5
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:46,500
Forom.com & Malcolm-France.com

6
00:01:09,327 --> 00:01:10,802
Stupid Christmas vacation.

7
00:01:10,865 --> 00:01:12,002
There's nothing to do.

8
00:01:12,339 --> 00:01:14,509
I wish I cared about something.
Then I could do that.

9
00:01:15,731 --> 00:01:17,753
You missed it!
It was so awesome!

10
00:01:18,069 --> 00:01:20,596
- What?
- Reese just came up with the most fun thing to do.

11
00:01:20,644 --> 00:01:23,804
Riding your bike through the graveyard with your eyes closed.

12
00:01:23,972 --> 00:01:30,481
He smashed into this one gravestone, flew through the air,
hit another gravestone and landed in an open grave.

13
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:33,008
Lying in that hole was surprisingly peaceful.

14
00:01:33,591 --> 00:01:35,212
I no longer fear death.

15
00:01:35,339 --> 00:01:38,941
I've been sitting here bored
out of my mind for four hours.
Why didn't you invite me?

16
00:01:39,088 --> 00:01:39,509
Didn't we?

17
00:01:39,678 --> 00:01:42,879
No. You didn't. You walked right by me.
I thought you were going out to the garage.

18
00:01:44,291 --> 00:01:44,880
Oh, well.

19
00:01:45,181 --> 00:01:46,235
It's not a big deal.

20
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:47,793
It's just that my feelings are kind of...

21
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:50,721
Oh, crap!

22
00:01:51,206 --> 00:01:52,891
Your what are kind of what?

23
00:01:52,996 --> 00:01:55,523
- Nothing. Forget it.
- I think someone has feelings, Dewey.

24
00:01:55,608 --> 00:01:56,345
I do not!

25
00:01:56,535 --> 00:01:57,798
We've gotta make this right.

26
00:01:58,008 --> 00:01:59,567
- Group hug?
- Shut up!

27
00:01:59,651 --> 00:02:01,610
Oh, listen to those feelings.

28
00:02:01,652 --> 00:02:04,159
- Come here, you.
- Get away from me!

29
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,876
In our house, that's the "F" word.

30
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:13,475
Okay, if we get Reese the walkie-talkies with only two channels,

31
00:02:13,601 --> 00:02:16,887
we can move $8.20 from his pile to Dewey's pile.

32
00:02:16,971 --> 00:02:19,583
Then Dewey can get the Spider-man figure that sticks to walls.

33
00:02:19,694 --> 00:02:21,085
We have enough stuff that sticks to walls.

34
00:02:21,232 --> 00:02:25,403
Dewey can live with the regular Spider-man.
Just make sure that Malcolm's pile has enough in it...

35
00:02:26,392 --> 00:02:29,025
Hal, we don't have a pile for Jamie.

36
00:02:29,636 --> 00:02:31,132
Oh, damn it!

37
00:02:32,979 --> 00:02:35,991
- You know, Jamie's not even old enough
to know it's Christmas. We could...
- Hal.

38
00:02:36,054 --> 00:02:37,149
All right!

39
00:02:37,718 --> 00:02:41,952
But this is ridiculous.
$93 to get gifts for four boys.

40
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:44,290
Well, it's our own fault. We just weren't frugal enough.

41
00:02:44,359 --> 00:02:48,361
What else can we do? We're already doing no-electricity Wednesdays,

42
00:02:48,424 --> 00:02:49,751
lunch lotteries,

43
00:02:50,194 --> 00:02:54,870
- Family flush.
- Okay, we'll make it work somehow. Just put it into four piles.

44
00:02:56,979 --> 00:03:01,550
- Hello?
- Hey, Mom, good news. I decided to come home for Christmas after all.

45
00:03:02,203 --> 00:03:04,078
Francis, that is, um...

46
00:03:04,899 --> 00:03:05,805
great.

47
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:09,491
What a nice surprise that you will be coming home for Christmas.

48
00:03:09,678 --> 00:03:11,847
We'll have the whole family here...

49
00:03:12,163 --> 00:03:13,680
exchanging gifts.

50
00:03:13,975 --> 00:03:16,776
- Piama, too?
- Of course. We can't wait to see you!

51
00:03:17,008 --> 00:03:18,988
Well, we can't wait to see you.

52
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,842
- Six piles?
- Five.

53
00:03:22,937 --> 00:03:24,453
Piama and Jamie can share.

54
00:03:31,088 --> 00:03:32,226
Excuse me?

55
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:36,249
I know you didn't think anyone would catch you,
but you just slammed your door into my car.

56
00:03:36,402 --> 00:03:38,698
The least you could do is say you're sorry, lady.

57
00:03:38,761 --> 00:03:40,214
You don't have to take that tone.

58
00:03:40,614 --> 00:03:42,763
It's not like I'm hurting your resale value.

59
00:03:49,572 --> 00:03:50,499
I'm sorry.

60
00:03:51,089 --> 00:03:52,353
See? Like that.

61
00:06:01,281 --> 00:06:02,524
I don't know what happened.

62
00:06:02,882 --> 00:06:04,462
I just lost control of myself.

63
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:10,928
It was like an out-of-body experience, and I was there
watching this woman go insane. And the woman was me.

64
00:06:11,855 --> 00:06:12,824
But you know what, Hal?

65
00:06:12,929 --> 00:06:14,193
I'd do it all over again.

66
00:06:14,537 --> 00:06:15,612
It felt great.

67
00:06:15,949 --> 00:06:18,013
It was almost worth destroying my car.

68
00:06:18,139 --> 00:06:21,193
Well, honey, the important thing is no cops were there to see it.

69
00:06:22,099 --> 00:06:23,637
No one says a word.

70
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:27,687
This is my one. My one to your 11,000.

71
00:06:28,951 --> 00:06:29,941
So,

72
00:06:30,383 --> 00:06:33,669
due to unforeseen circumstances, we are now completely broke.

73
00:06:33,838 --> 00:06:35,881
Therefore, I am making a proclamation.

74
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:38,698
This will be a handmade Christmas.

75
00:06:39,078 --> 00:06:41,015
We're not spending any money on gifts.

76
00:06:41,268 --> 00:06:42,616
They will be homemade,

77
00:06:42,721 --> 00:06:44,217
and therefore, more personal

78
00:06:44,407 --> 00:06:45,186
and more thoughtful.

79
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:49,209
- But you can't do this!
- Well, I think it's high time we had a handmade Christmas.

80
00:06:49,334 --> 00:06:54,157
You boys just don't appreciate the holidays.
To you it's nothing but a disgusting orgy of materialism.

81
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,610
- But...
- No buts!

82
00:06:55,716 --> 00:06:58,496
You're the ones who turned your mother
into a ticking time bomb!

83
00:06:58,538 --> 00:07:02,835
Oh, you just thank your lucky stars
that she went off on an innocent bystander!

84
00:07:09,972 --> 00:07:15,764
So we had our Christmas feast of oatmeal and hot dog buns.
Since then, we've been waiting three hours for Dad to come out of the garage.

85
00:07:15,845 --> 00:07:18,162
What is taking him so long?

86
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:22,227
What are you talking about?

87
00:07:22,564 --> 00:07:23,996
Nothing you'd be interested in.

88
00:07:24,081 --> 00:07:24,965
You don't know that.

89
00:07:25,113 --> 00:07:27,577
If it's interesting to you guys,
it's gonna be interesting to me.

90
00:07:27,724 --> 00:07:29,367
We were wondering what nose hairs smell like.

91
00:07:30,734 --> 00:07:32,398
Well, that's very interesting!

92
00:07:32,924 --> 00:07:35,136
Hal, hurry up already!

93
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:36,821
In a minute.

94
00:07:42,746 --> 00:07:43,841
<i>Hal!</i>

95
00:07:50,821 --> 00:07:53,559
All right, everyone over by the tree.

96
00:07:56,108 --> 00:08:00,616
- Open mine first!
- Okay, okay. Let's see what little Dewey made for his dad.

97
00:08:03,609 --> 00:08:05,589
Where did you find that?

98
00:08:05,673 --> 00:08:07,105
I never take a good picture.

99
00:08:07,169 --> 00:08:09,717
I went through every box in the attic and found that one.

100
00:08:09,865 --> 00:08:12,013
I made the frame with mementos of your hobbies.

101
00:08:12,413 --> 00:08:13,761
Wait. You made this frame?

102
00:08:13,888 --> 00:08:14,372
Yeah.

103
00:08:14,547 --> 00:08:19,645
See it has a little golf club, a fishing pole, a poker hand.
I even pasted on the Jumble you finished.

104
00:08:20,003 --> 00:08:22,973
Dewey, this is really nice.

105
00:08:23,078 --> 00:08:25,964
- Here, Mom, this is from me.
- Oh, it's so heavy.

106
00:08:27,603 --> 00:08:31,352
Wow! Reese, are these jams?

107
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:35,733
And candies. I had some sugar left over, so I figured, why not, it's Christmas.

108
00:08:36,007 --> 00:08:38,345
- You made this?!
- Here, Mom. Here, Dad.

109
00:08:39,404 --> 00:08:42,438
Oh, my God, it's a clock.

110
00:08:43,133 --> 00:08:44,270
You made this?!

111
00:08:44,396 --> 00:08:49,662
I read up on all-wood clocks and then borrowed the tools from wood shop.
See the gears? They make different patterns as they turn.

112
00:08:49,731 --> 00:08:54,007
Oh, I'm very impressed, boys.
You all worked so hard on these gifts.

113
00:08:54,112 --> 00:08:58,051
- Open mine next. It's a sonata I composed for you.
- Oh, I'll get to it.

114
00:08:58,093 --> 00:09:00,474
It's your father's turn to give something.

115
00:09:04,957 --> 00:09:06,032
My gift...

116
00:09:07,127 --> 00:09:08,075
isn't here.

117
00:09:08,812 --> 00:09:12,730
- Not here? What do you mean?
Well, we-we knew the boys would really come through with great gifts,

118
00:09:12,797 --> 00:09:16,673
and any present that top what they did can't be here...

119
00:09:16,739 --> 00:09:17,405
can it?

120
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:20,772
Merry Chris...
You started without us?

121
00:09:20,869 --> 00:09:23,023
Dad's about to give us a really cool present!

122
00:09:23,414 --> 00:09:24,550
Is it outside?

123
00:09:24,648 --> 00:09:25,979
Let's find out.

124
00:09:26,051 --> 00:09:26,932
Like a treasure hunt?

125
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:40,369
Wow, Mom, this is fantastic.
I am so happy to be home for Christmas.

126
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:44,323
You said this house was Satan's trash can.

127
00:09:44,479 --> 00:09:46,222
You're quoting me out of context.

128
00:09:46,553 --> 00:09:47,708
So, Dad, where is it?

129
00:09:47,865 --> 00:09:49,353
Are we supposed to drive to it?

130
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,527
Yes!

131
00:09:51,095 --> 00:09:51,604
Yes!

132
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:57,007
You guessed the first clue.
Everybody into the van. Let's go!

133
00:09:57,099 --> 00:09:59,174
- Hal...
- Merry Christmas, honey!

134
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:12,930
Are we there yet?

135
00:10:13,403 --> 00:10:14,361
Yeah, where are we going?

136
00:10:14,403 --> 00:10:16,695
I know. We're going to Disneyland.

137
00:10:16,751 --> 00:10:19,307
It's a thousand times better than Disneyland.

138
00:10:19,417 --> 00:10:20,334
Cool!

139
00:10:26,669 --> 00:10:27,488
What was that?

140
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:28,640
A handshake.

141
00:10:29,641 --> 00:10:32,725
Now they've got some lame, third-grade secret handshake.

142
00:10:33,322 --> 00:10:34,600
I think I got half of it.

143
00:10:34,655 --> 00:10:36,114
We love Dad!

144
00:10:36,266 --> 00:10:37,572
We love Dad!

145
00:10:37,795 --> 00:10:39,156
We love Dad!

146
00:10:39,406 --> 00:10:40,768
We love Dad!

147
00:10:40,907 --> 00:10:42,000
We love Dad!

148
00:10:45,081 --> 00:10:49,416
Rest stop. Everybody out. No eye contact with strangers.

149
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,374
Look at 'em scamper.

150
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:01,540
- You don't need to...?
- No.

151
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:26,500
- You couldn't have said twice as good as Disneyland?
- You saw those presents, Lois!
What was I supposed to do? My presents were crap!

152
00:11:26,975 --> 00:11:28,601
- What did you make them?
- Lanyards.

153
00:11:28,976 --> 00:11:30,532
Still better than what I had.

154
00:11:31,088 --> 00:11:35,325
Look, I underestimated these boys, Lois, 
and they deserve to have a really great Christmas.

155
00:11:35,835 --> 00:11:36,933
How much money do we have?

156
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:40,336
- Zero.
- No, I mean everything: credit cards, loose change, everything?

157
00:11:40,378 --> 00:11:43,295
- Oh. Minus $512.
- What?!

158
00:11:43,689 --> 00:11:45,634
Oh, for God's sakes!

159
00:11:47,357 --> 00:11:50,316
Can you think of a Christmas reason for stopping somewhere I can sell blood?

160
00:11:50,384 --> 00:11:53,135
Oh, Hal, don't worry about it. It'll be okay.

161
00:11:53,413 --> 00:11:56,525
You just need to find something that's a thousand times better than Disneyland,

162
00:11:56,871 --> 00:11:59,135
open on Christmas day and free.

163
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:04,581
Just because it's hard, Lois, doesn't mean it's impossible.
I am going to make this happen.

164
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:06,806
Hal, we don't even have enough gas to get home.

165
00:12:06,848 --> 00:12:13,891
Yes, we do. I did all the calculations, Lois.
We're exactly 40 miles from the point of no return. And I promise you,

166
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:15,865
I will figure out a plan by then.

167
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:19,659
If not, I will turn the van around.
Just don't rat me out.

168
00:12:20,476 --> 00:12:21,639
Please, honey.

169
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:23,619
It's Christmas.

170
00:12:24,817 --> 00:12:26,606
I can't wait much longer.

171
00:12:26,719 --> 00:12:29,307
Mom, is it really going to be as good as Dad says?

172
00:12:31,252 --> 00:12:34,412
Dewey, I think you'll remember this day for a long time.

173
00:12:35,522 --> 00:12:38,665
I think we'll all remember this day for a very long time.

174
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:45,230
All right, since no one wants to race cigarette butts, I'm outta here.

175
00:12:48,187 --> 00:12:49,907
Francis, I need to talk to you about something.

176
00:12:50,619 --> 00:12:51,678
It's weird,

177
00:12:51,763 --> 00:12:57,025
- but lately I kind of feel like I'm being left out by Reese and Dewey.
- Aw, geez. Look, I'm sorry. You weren't supposed to know about the beach trip.

178
00:12:57,129 --> 00:12:59,092
- What?!
- Hey, geez, watch it!

179
00:12:59,161 --> 00:13:00,342
What beach trip?!

180
00:13:00,444 --> 00:13:04,456
I took Reese and Dewey to the beach last summer.
I would've invited you, but you were over at Stevie's.

181
00:13:04,508 --> 00:13:06,314
He lives two blocks away!

182
00:13:06,401 --> 00:13:08,676
You have to go by his house to get to the beach!

183
00:13:09,179 --> 00:13:10,412
Why is this happening?

184
00:13:10,596 --> 00:13:12,211
I'm the brother everybody likes the best.

185
00:13:12,263 --> 00:13:14,695
What are you talking about?
I'm the brother everybody likes best.

186
00:13:14,764 --> 00:13:16,483
I meant of the brothers who are still at home.

187
00:13:16,605 --> 00:13:17,543
That's Dewey.

188
00:13:17,766 --> 00:13:24,852
- What? Where am I in the pecking order?
- Malcolm, I am not gonna stand here in a public toilet and rank me,
Dewey, Reese, Jamie and you in order of popularity.

189
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:31,254
So are we getting close?

190
00:13:31,428 --> 00:13:32,470
Now, now.

191
00:13:32,557 --> 00:13:34,745
You're not going to trick me into giving it away.

192
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:36,100
It's a surprise.

193
00:13:36,289 --> 00:13:40,022
Hal, you are five miles from your point of no return.

194
00:13:42,784 --> 00:13:46,239
Look, I know we don't talk about our emotions, but I don't care anymore.

195
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:47,830
I'm just going to lay it out there.

196
00:13:48,316 --> 00:13:49,775
My feelings are hurt.

197
00:13:50,174 --> 00:13:51,633
There, I said it.

198
00:13:51,894 --> 00:13:54,585
They're hurt because you guys are systematically excluding me.

199
00:13:54,948 --> 00:14:00,332
Being excluded is extra hard for me because I see all the other places
I don't fit in, and we're brothers.

200
00:14:00,731 --> 00:14:02,416
I really want us to be in this together.

201
00:14:05,019 --> 00:14:06,704
What a gasbag.

202
00:14:06,843 --> 00:14:09,065
Your feelings aren't hurt. Your ego is bruised.

203
00:14:09,239 --> 00:14:12,226
The reason we exclude you sometimes  is because you're a drag.

204
00:14:12,504 --> 00:14:13,876
You always have to be the special one.

205
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:18,025
Even now, this is all about how you feel things more deeply than everyone else.

206
00:14:18,216 --> 00:14:21,428
Look, we love you. We just need a break from you once in a while.

207
00:14:26,312 --> 00:14:29,611
- Okay, Hal...
- Francis, can I see you up here for a second, please?
I need your help with the radio.

208
00:14:33,058 --> 00:14:41,602
- What are you...?
- I need to borrow $1,800. I'll pay you back over the next six years in monthly payments of $39.50.
I have no money to give these boys a Christmas gift and I'm not even sure where I'm driving.

209
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:44,319
I hate to ask you, but I don't know what else to do.

210
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:46,663
I love you.

211
00:14:48,209 --> 00:14:50,640
Well I guess this is as good a time as any to tell you.

212
00:14:51,264 --> 00:14:54,285
- I got fired from my job. I'm totally broke.
- What?

213
00:14:54,355 --> 00:14:59,773
- You got fired from the ranch?
- It turns out the ATM I was making all of Otto's deposits into wasn't an ATM.

214
00:14:59,842 --> 00:15:01,180
So sue me, right?

215
00:15:01,356 --> 00:15:02,901
Anyway, he's suing me.

216
00:15:03,006 --> 00:15:05,697
- I don't know what we're going to do.
- You're not moving back in!

217
00:15:05,784 --> 00:15:08,702
- There isn't room enough in the house!
- Besides, Piama doesn't want to live with us.

218
00:15:08,769 --> 00:15:11,895
Piama doesn't even know about it.
She thinks I'm on vacation.

219
00:15:12,017 --> 00:15:17,713
- I've been acting like the happiest man in the world
the last few weeks just to hide it from her.
- I have to say, I am a little disappointed in you, Francis.

220
00:15:17,815 --> 00:15:20,194
You can't hide something like this from the ones you love.

221
00:15:20,385 --> 00:15:23,806
Honesty: it's the cornerstone of any healthy relationship.

222
00:15:24,605 --> 00:15:26,706
Well, I'm sorry I can't help you.

223
00:15:31,016 --> 00:15:36,313
Okay, Hal, it's been 40 miles. We are at the point of no return.

224
00:15:39,037 --> 00:15:40,635
Hal, turn around.

225
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:56,773
Let's get out and stretch your legs!

226
00:16:00,303 --> 00:16:01,154
You're coming Malcom?

227
00:16:01,414 --> 00:16:03,967
You're sure? I might accidently talk about myself.

228
00:16:04,071 --> 00:16:05,131
You mean like just now?

229
00:16:08,971 --> 00:16:12,392
- Hal what are you doing,
- I'm buying time.

230
00:16:12,462 --> 00:16:15,171
I don't know how you gotta be along with this but that's it!

231
00:16:15,188 --> 00:16:17,203
The Christmas lie is over.

232
00:16:17,234 --> 00:16:20,325
- 60 more seconds, Lois. You can time me.
- I'm not...!

233
00:16:21,373 --> 00:16:22,156
Fine.

234
00:16:24,181 --> 00:16:26,472
Whoa, nice rides.

235
00:16:26,511 --> 00:16:29,682
Yeah. The fat lady at the car wash rides one of these.

236
00:16:32,359 --> 00:16:35,823
- Nice going, Dewey!
- I wasn't even touching it. It was you!

237
00:16:35,921 --> 00:16:37,409
What'd you do, man?!

238
00:16:38,545 --> 00:16:41,226
<i>Wait, wait!</i>
Those guys didn't do it.

239
00:16:41,618 --> 00:16:42,734
What are you talking about?

240
00:16:42,992 --> 00:16:45,987
I'm not going to let these people take the blame when they didn't do it.

241
00:16:47,807 --> 00:16:49,491
It was my dad.

242
00:16:51,775 --> 00:16:54,555
He was trying to teach me a lesson so I wouldn't grow up and be like you.

243
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,810
Malcolm, oh, my God, that was awesome!

244
00:17:02,908 --> 00:17:04,200
- That was so cool!
- Thanks!

245
00:17:07,156 --> 00:17:10,151
Okay, honey, you've got 20 seconds.

246
00:17:17,987 --> 00:17:20,571
Lois, there is going to be a Christmas!

247
00:17:21,058 --> 00:17:22,154
Hal, no!

248
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:28,810
Oh, no! I seem to have slipped in an oil stain left here
by a negligent owner or employee.

249
00:17:28,888 --> 00:17:29,500
Hal!

250
00:17:34,058 --> 00:17:35,428
Oh, my God!

251
00:17:35,937 --> 00:17:37,425
Are you okay?

252
00:17:40,244 --> 00:17:41,966
Yes, damn it!

253
00:17:42,078 --> 00:17:43,272
Oh, thank goodness.

254
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:45,250
I don't have any insurance.

255
00:17:45,504 --> 00:17:46,992
We both dodged a bullet.

256
00:17:47,794 --> 00:17:51,279
After I sweep this up, you're getting wiper  blades on the house.

257
00:17:53,602 --> 00:17:54,738
Hal...

258
00:17:55,012 --> 00:17:55,775
You know what?

259
00:17:55,854 --> 00:18:02,216
- I saw a trail behind here that leads up into the hills. There's probably 
something really great up there. All we need is a few flashlights to get started.
- Hal,

260
00:18:02,269 --> 00:18:06,791
it's time for you to face the boys and tell them what's going on.
Hal, they're good boys.

261
00:18:07,281 --> 00:18:10,237
They forgave you for banjo camp; they'll forgive you for this.

262
00:18:10,328 --> 00:18:12,756
And I will try sharing the blame with you, but honey,

263
00:18:13,323 --> 00:18:15,516
this has got your fingerprints all over it.

264
00:18:17,801 --> 00:18:22,420
- You know, you're a pretty good brother after all.
- Thanks. You look cold. Take my jacket.

265
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:24,163
I think I could've handled those bikers,

266
00:18:24,378 --> 00:18:27,412
but with a baby and a chick around, you probably did the  right thing, Malcolm.

267
00:18:27,474 --> 00:18:28,981
Thanks for thinking of us, Reese.

268
00:18:29,294 --> 00:18:30,058
What's this?

269
00:18:30,155 --> 00:18:31,017
Nothing. Give me that.

270
00:18:31,115 --> 00:18:33,718
It's a credit card receipt from The Clockworks.

271
00:18:33,836 --> 00:18:35,461
You bought those clocks?

272
00:18:35,539 --> 00:18:37,105
You have a credit card? Since when?

273
00:18:37,161 --> 00:18:39,275
They sent it to me in the mail a couple months ago.

274
00:18:39,471 --> 00:18:41,683
They must've thought I was old enough after I won that physics award.

275
00:18:41,762 --> 00:18:47,184
So when I superglued my eyelids shut, and I was in the emergency room,
we could've used your credit card instead of having to call Mom?!

276
00:18:47,258 --> 00:18:50,077
I'm not going to let you jeopardize my credit rating.
I want to buy a house someday.

277
00:18:50,214 --> 00:18:51,545
Malcolm, you're a jerk.

278
00:18:51,702 --> 00:18:55,636
Mom, Malcolm has a credit card, and he bought you Christmas presents with it.

279
00:18:55,754 --> 00:18:56,400
What?

280
00:18:56,903 --> 00:18:59,546
Malcolm, you bought those presents,

281
00:18:59,742 --> 00:19:01,680
after everything I've been through?

282
00:19:02,247 --> 00:19:06,907
We all worked so hard to make this a special Christmas, 
and you just took a cheap shortcut!

283
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:11,569
- Those clocks cost 50 bucks each!
- I don't care what they cost!

284
00:19:12,058 --> 00:19:14,701
This isn't a competition, Malcolm.

285
00:19:14,877 --> 00:19:18,224
You know, all I really want from you on Christmas is this!

286
00:19:28,979 --> 00:19:30,408
I forgive you, son.

287
00:19:32,131 --> 00:19:35,009
Okay, everybody, listen up. 
I don't want this to ruin our trip.

288
00:19:35,576 --> 00:19:37,867
- You wanna know where we're going?
- Yeah!

289
00:19:40,354 --> 00:19:42,840
Snow skiing on Mount Bundy!

290
00:19:50,607 --> 00:19:55,873
That's a room for the night, ski passes and equipment rentals.
Will you be putting that on your credit card?

291
00:19:56,264 --> 00:19:57,595
Let's give it a shot.

292
00:20:09,456 --> 00:20:10,768
Oh, yes!

293
00:20:10,866 --> 00:20:12,569
In your face!

294
00:20:17,307 --> 00:20:19,284
Hal, this is the low point, isn't it?

295
00:20:19,377 --> 00:20:21,099
We're not going to sink any further, are we?

296
00:20:21,197 --> 00:20:24,682
- What are you talking about?
- You've stolen our son's credit card.

297
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:28,147
If it weren't for my rage and your recklessness,
our kids might have a fighting chance.

298
00:20:28,219 --> 00:20:35,932
Lois, those are the exact things that make us great parents.
If it wasn't for your anger and my recklessness,
we wouldn't be on this amazing ski vacation, would we?

299
00:20:38,689 --> 00:20:41,018
You know, this just might be our best Christmas ever.

300
00:20:41,547 --> 00:20:43,544
Francis, I want you to quit your job.

301
00:20:44,718 --> 00:20:49,475
- What?
- Ever since we left on this trip, you've just seemed so insanely happy.

302
00:20:49,608 --> 00:20:53,503
I can't let you go back to that job.
You've got to find something else to do.

303
00:20:54,599 --> 00:20:55,461
You're right.

304
00:20:55,944 --> 00:21:00,466
You know, in fact, let's not even go back to that ranch.
I'll call Otto in the morning, and if he doesn't understand,

305
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,347
