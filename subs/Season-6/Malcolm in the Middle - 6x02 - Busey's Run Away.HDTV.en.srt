1
00:00:01,606 --> 00:00:03,840
Where the hell are my glasses?!

2
00:00:03,908 --> 00:00:06,452
I've been looking for...
Where are they?!

3
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:10,151
Are you sure you
haven't seen them?

4
00:00:11,485 --> 00:00:12,824
- No.
- Sorry, Dad.

5
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:14,505
They gotta be right
there somewhere.

6
00:00:14,571 --> 00:00:18,045
He's been looking for those
glasses for two and a half hours.

7
00:00:18,102 --> 00:00:19,904
He's totally shattered
his old record.

8
00:00:21,043 --> 00:00:22,137
This is ridiculous.

9
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:23,681
They just disappear.

10
00:00:25,521 --> 00:00:27,089
Maybe they're in the car.

11
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:30,719
Where the hell are my keys?!

12
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:38,400

15
00:01:06,498 --> 00:01:07,602
Give me back the deodorant.

16
00:01:07,653 --> 00:01:09,133
I haven't done the upper half
of my body yet.

17
00:01:09,184 --> 00:01:09,578
No!

18
00:01:09,638 --> 00:01:11,934
This has to last us the whole month,
and you're wasting it!

19
00:01:11,985 --> 00:01:13,249
I am not wasting it.

20
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:16,648
You used up two inches of it drawing stick
people having sex on the bathroom mirror!

21
00:01:16,699 --> 00:01:18,464
Would you two keep it down?

22
00:01:18,832 --> 00:01:21,523
Your father's talking with that man
he interviewed with yesterday.

23
00:01:21,574 --> 00:01:24,203
Thank God one of
us might finally have a job.

24
00:01:24,541 --> 00:01:25,796
No, no, I understand.

25
00:01:25,847 --> 00:01:27,846
He sounds like an
excellent candidate.

26
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:30,280
I would have hired
him over me too.

27
00:01:31,069 --> 00:01:33,651
Right, his experience is more...

28
00:01:35,501 --> 00:01:37,210
Okay, he's much smarter...

29
00:01:38,216 --> 00:01:40,600
Right, more charismatic.

30
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,300
Funny.

32
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:46,445
I said quiet!

33
00:01:48,011 --> 00:01:49,004
And you.

34
00:01:50,488 --> 00:01:51,351
No.

35
00:01:52,535 --> 00:01:54,796
This is the last day
in your Special Needs class.

36
00:01:54,847 --> 00:01:55,669
You have no idea

37
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,739
how many hours I have spent trying to
convince Mrs. Walsh that you are normal,

38
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:00,511
so don't screw it up.

39
00:02:00,657 --> 00:02:01,684
Do you understand?

40
00:02:01,924 --> 00:02:02,529
Yes.

41
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:03,379
Do you?

42
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:03,908
Yes.

43
00:02:03,981 --> 00:02:04,787
Do you?

44
00:02:04,838 --> 00:02:06,511
Yes, Mom.

45
00:02:07,514 --> 00:02:09,868
Yes, he does have
a better head of hair...

46
00:02:10,014 --> 00:02:13,671
No, I have no idea what he would like
as a "Welcome to the Firm" gift...

47
00:02:14,019 --> 00:02:15,810
Okay, goodbye.

48
00:02:17,529 --> 00:02:18,745
Don't worry about it.

49
00:02:18,796 --> 00:02:21,150
There's got to be something
I can get a job at.

50
00:02:21,249 --> 00:02:23,287
There's got to be a big
turnover in Test Pilots.

51
00:02:23,338 --> 00:02:25,462
Or advertising.
I can do advertising.

52
00:02:25,513 --> 00:02:27,518
Hal, you have no experience
in advertising.

53
00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:31,107
I am a natural, little jingles
are constantly popping into my head.

54
00:02:32,244 --> 00:02:34,118
A-Wham-Bam!
Thank you, Jam.

55
00:02:34,169 --> 00:02:36,938
Who's gonna love it?
Your family am.

56
00:02:39,985 --> 00:02:43,684
Banana skin,
it's so nice and thin.

57
00:02:43,929 --> 00:02:46,845
There's no better way
to keep your banana in.

58
00:02:46,896 --> 00:02:47,496
Hal...

59
00:02:47,595 --> 00:02:51,938
Newspaper, keeping track
of your neighbourhood raper.

60
00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:52,796
Hal!

61
00:02:53,172 --> 00:02:54,825
Oh, I'm sorry, Lois.

62
00:02:55,097 --> 00:02:58,259
I just feel so useless, sitting around
the house all day doing nothing.

63
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:00,929
Well, then, how about taking
Jamie to the park?

64
00:03:01,174 --> 00:03:02,560
You never get to do that.

65
00:03:02,611 --> 00:03:03,699
Yeah, you're right.

66
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:06,978
I should enjoy him before
he's old enough to be ashamed of me.

67
00:03:08,181 --> 00:03:13,204
And I think we should all be very happy for
Dewey to be rejoining the Mainstream class.

68
00:03:13,366 --> 00:03:14,949
It's really quite
an accomplishment,

69
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,343
and I think a positive
example for the rest

70
00:03:17,394 --> 00:03:20,906
of you that you don't have to be
in here for the rest of your lives.

71
00:03:21,488 --> 00:03:25,875
There's always a chance to esca...
get a transfer over.

72
00:03:26,364 --> 00:03:28,369
Okay, well, now it's time
to say our goodbyes.

73
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,753
If everyone would...

74
00:03:31,059 --> 00:03:32,520
We need you, Dewey.

75
00:03:32,571 --> 00:03:34,775
It's going to make
the eyes stop following us.

76
00:03:34,826 --> 00:03:37,568
Things have gotten so much
better since you got here.

77
00:03:37,643 --> 00:03:40,287
Chad hasn't bitten
anything alive in weeks.

78
00:03:40,338 --> 00:03:42,308
I get off my motorcycle for lunch.

79
00:03:42,359 --> 00:03:44,834
You take care of us.
You've got the microscope.

80
00:03:44,885 --> 00:03:46,303
And the beautiful view.

81
00:03:49,045 --> 00:03:51,777
Please, stay with us.

82
00:03:52,078 --> 00:03:53,478
It's not up to me.

83
00:03:53,845 --> 00:03:54,802
It's my Mom.

84
00:03:57,864 --> 00:03:58,389
Hug jail!

85
00:03:58,437 --> 00:03:59,930
Make him stay with a hug jail!

86
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:45,422
Wow, you guys are huge!
And, shiny.

87
00:04:45,473 --> 00:04:46,543
Thanks, mister.

88
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:48,614
But we can always be huger.

89
00:04:48,665 --> 00:04:49,688
And shiner.

90
00:04:49,848 --> 00:04:50,887
You're out here all day?

91
00:04:50,938 --> 00:04:53,050
As long as those disability
checks keep coming.

92
00:04:53,454 --> 00:04:56,778
Oh, no, no, no.

93
00:05:00,122 --> 00:05:00,926
What happened?

94
00:05:00,977 --> 00:05:02,728
My keys fell down
the drain again.

95
00:05:02,779 --> 00:05:05,132
And my fingers are too
titanically muscular

96
00:05:05,183 --> 00:05:07,710
to fit through the little metal
stripes and rip ‘em out.

97
00:05:08,465 --> 00:05:11,693
Well, maybe we could punch
the concrete around it into dust,

98
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:12,932
and loosen the bars.

99
00:05:12,983 --> 00:05:14,955
Guys, you don't have to do that.

100
00:05:15,734 --> 00:05:16,448
Hang on.

101
00:05:18,483 --> 00:05:19,576
This'll work.

102
00:05:20,027 --> 00:05:21,176
Here.

103
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:22,521
Give me your gum.

104
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:25,257
Okay, but I've been chewing it all
morning and it hasn't helped.

105
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:38,679
He did it! Three cheers
for the scrawny guy!

106
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:43,011
Yeah!
Hooray!

107
00:05:49,202 --> 00:05:50,935
Come on, Dewey,
this is going to be great.

108
00:05:50,986 --> 00:05:53,132
You've seen fireworks before,
and you've seen movies.

109
00:05:53,183 --> 00:05:55,603
You've never seen them together,
at the same time.

110
00:05:55,654 --> 00:05:57,785
Let's get moving,
I want to pay matinee prices.

111
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,527
I don't feel like it.
Go without me.

112
00:06:00,913 --> 00:06:02,486
Come on, we're trying
to do something nice here,

113
00:06:02,537 --> 00:06:03,851
and reach out to you as a brother.

114
00:06:04,005 --> 00:06:06,014
Yeah, you don't have to worry,
we're not setting you up.

115
00:06:06,869 --> 00:06:07,469
Are we?

116
00:06:07,479 --> 00:06:07,976
No.

117
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,864
I just don't want to go, okay?

118
00:06:09,986 --> 00:06:11,075
Leave me alone.

119
00:06:14,943 --> 00:06:16,460
Bye hon, I'm off to the park.

120
00:06:16,511 --> 00:06:17,850
Oh, three days in a row.

121
00:06:17,901 --> 00:06:19,023
Yeah, you know what?
It's great.

122
00:06:19,074 --> 00:06:20,817
It's giving me a new
outlook on things.

123
00:06:20,868 --> 00:06:22,576
I'm sure Jamie's loving it.

124
00:06:23,478 --> 00:06:24,469
Oh, yeah.

125
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,487
Jamie.

126
00:06:27,841 --> 00:06:29,639
We've only got two bottles
of Baby Oil left,

127
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:31,371
I'll pick up a case
this afternoon.

128
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:33,959
I think two of
my fingers fused together.

129
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:36,751
Great. That leaves eight
for me to punish to the bone.

130
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:38,947
Now, get moving.
You better not be late for school.

131
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:39,660
You hear me?

132
00:06:39,711 --> 00:06:41,059
And I want you home
at three o'clock.

133
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:43,707
Your homework better be finished
or I'll set off some fireworks

134
00:06:43,758 --> 00:06:45,955
in a place a lot darker
than a movie theatre.

135
00:06:46,229 --> 00:06:47,525
Have a nice day, honey.

136
00:06:48,934 --> 00:06:51,271
Aren't you going to warn me
not to lose my milk money?

137
00:06:51,591 --> 00:06:53,703
Or that I better be polite to
the crossing guard?

138
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:54,398
No.

139
00:07:01,997 --> 00:07:03,063
There you go.

140
00:07:03,114 --> 00:07:04,522
Balanced to the penny.

141
00:07:04,842 --> 00:07:07,101
The problem is,
you weren't adding the check amount,

142
00:07:07,152 --> 00:07:09,527
you were adding your address
over and over.

143
00:07:09,593 --> 00:07:13,180
I thought that number had a
lot of words in it. Thanks, Hal.

144
00:07:13,246 --> 00:07:15,196
You see,
it's not that difficult, guys.

145
00:07:15,247 --> 00:07:17,575
And remember for next
time, the stamp

146
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:20,101
goes on the letter,
not the mailbox.

147
00:07:20,609 --> 00:07:21,788
Is that the thing
firemen use?

148
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:23,205
No, that's a hydrant.

149
00:07:23,256 --> 00:07:24,775
Remember the "no parking" stump?

150
00:07:24,826 --> 00:07:27,188
Oh, yeah.

151
00:07:27,239 --> 00:07:28,831
Oh, I gotta go.

152
00:07:28,882 --> 00:07:32,018
I promised Lois I'd stop by
the market on the way home.

153
00:07:34,432 --> 00:07:37,056
Oh, you had a good day,
didn't you, honey?

154
00:07:37,107 --> 00:07:40,295
Hey, did you like when Carlo
threw you way, way up in the air?

155
00:07:40,346 --> 00:07:42,252
And Daddy was screaming, wasn't he?

156
00:07:49,746 --> 00:07:53,220
Guys, don't worry,
I'll be back tomorrow.

157
00:08:25,826 --> 00:08:27,394
Useless peace of junk!

158
00:08:45,694 --> 00:08:46,695
Good night, honey.

159
00:08:46,746 --> 00:08:49,609
I made you a turkey and cream cheese
sandwich for school tomorrow.

160
00:08:52,485 --> 00:08:53,486
What are you trying to do?

161
00:08:53,537 --> 00:08:56,040
Mom hasn't made you do any
of the crap she's made us do.

162
00:08:56,091 --> 00:08:57,480
Why is she being so nice to you?

163
00:08:57,743 --> 00:09:01,067
Because, for the last 3 days,
I haven't done anything wrong.

164
00:09:01,698 --> 00:09:02,426
You see,

165
00:09:02,477 --> 00:09:06,092
Mom doesn't yell and scream at us because
it's the only way she knows how to talk.

166
00:09:06,252 --> 00:09:08,411
She does it because
we do stuff that's bad.

167
00:09:08,674 --> 00:09:11,322
And if you don't do anything,
she doesn't get mad at you.

168
00:09:11,808 --> 00:09:12,849
You understand?

169
00:09:13,657 --> 00:09:15,685
It's not her. It's us.

170
00:09:16,869 --> 00:09:18,370
Fine, don't tell us.

171
00:09:20,944 --> 00:09:22,230
Well, that's strange.

172
00:09:22,589 --> 00:09:25,330
For some reason,
I'm taking 1/3 less Asprin than usual.

173
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:26,876
Why are you pacing?

174
00:09:26,927 --> 00:09:28,331
Let me ask you something, Lois.

175
00:09:28,382 --> 00:09:30,322
What would you do if,
hypothetically,

176
00:09:30,373 --> 00:09:32,165
there were a series of
unforeseeable circumstances,

177
00:09:32,216 --> 00:09:36,112
you found yourself commanding
an army of benevolent strong men?

178
00:09:36,864 --> 00:09:37,342
What?

179
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:38,159
Picture it.

180
00:09:38,225 --> 00:09:41,132
A dozen guys, any one
of ‘em can rip a horse in half,

181
00:09:41,183 --> 00:09:43,173
willing to follow
your every command.

182
00:09:43,462 --> 00:09:45,453
I'd have to do something
really great with that,

183
00:09:45,838 --> 00:09:49,396
something noble and unselfish,
but not too expensive.

184
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:53,809
And we are not even taking into account that
I could easily be led to the dark side.

185
00:09:54,456 --> 00:09:56,324
Lois, you have to promise me.

186
00:09:56,381 --> 00:09:59,983
If you ever see me holding a cat
and laughing maniacally over a globe,

187
00:10:00,034 --> 00:10:01,413
you need to let me know.

188
00:10:04,665 --> 00:10:06,712
After this,
I'll show you how to play Gin Rummy.

189
00:10:06,769 --> 00:10:08,323
That's always been
mama's favourite game.

190
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:09,144
Okay.

191
00:10:09,229 --> 00:10:11,651
So, Dewey, do you like being back
in the normal class?

192
00:10:15,659 --> 00:10:16,579
Hello.

193
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:18,579
Mrs Walsh, what a surprise.

194
00:10:18,825 --> 00:10:20,088
You're here to check up on Dewey,

195
00:10:20,139 --> 00:10:22,830
I can assure you that he's just
as normal and wonderful as...

196
00:10:22,881 --> 00:10:25,450
No, actually, I just came to find out
if Dewey's heard from any

197
00:10:25,501 --> 00:10:27,453
of the children from
the special needs class.

198
00:10:27,509 --> 00:10:28,720
No, why?

199
00:10:28,974 --> 00:10:32,025
Well, uh, seems they've run away.

200
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,355
All of them?

201
00:10:33,406 --> 00:10:34,980
The whole class ran away?

202
00:10:35,031 --> 00:10:36,655
They just disappeared.

203
00:10:37,481 --> 00:10:39,281
Dewey, do you know
anything about this?

204
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:41,229
Okay, well,

205
00:10:41,812 --> 00:10:45,304
thank you, and if you hear anything,
please let me know.

206
00:10:45,807 --> 00:10:46,577
I'll see ya.

207
00:10:48,292 --> 00:10:49,999
Oh, those kids.

208
00:10:50,492 --> 00:10:52,454
I'm so glad you're
out of that class.

209
00:10:53,175 --> 00:10:53,949
You know what?

210
00:10:54,266 --> 00:10:56,263
I think I'm going to bake
you some cookies.

211
00:11:22,935 --> 00:11:24,018
What are you doing?

212
00:11:24,069 --> 00:11:25,648
We couldn't take it any more.

213
00:11:25,699 --> 00:11:26,983
It's horrible without you.

214
00:11:27,034 --> 00:11:28,230
We're never going back.

215
00:11:28,281 --> 00:11:29,559
This is our new home.

216
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:31,047
They'll never find us here.

217
00:11:31,098 --> 00:11:32,031
It's perfect.

218
00:11:32,082 --> 00:11:33,263
We took blankets,

219
00:11:33,314 --> 00:11:36,474
and we stole some food from
the dumpster outside some restaurant.

220
00:11:36,525 --> 00:11:39,296
We can't think any more.
What we're doing, Dewey.

221
00:11:39,968 --> 00:11:42,178
You thought I'd steal
food from the trash and

222
00:11:42,229 --> 00:11:45,772
tell 20 kids to run away
and live in the trees forever?

223
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:47,922
Oh, maybe.

224
00:11:47,973 --> 00:11:49,522
But you can't stay up here.

225
00:11:49,573 --> 00:11:50,825
People are looking for you.

226
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:52,657
Mrs Walsh came to my house.

227
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:53,994
We're never going home.

228
00:11:54,045 --> 00:11:55,450
You come live with us.

229
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:58,650
The sqirrels will have to vote you in,
but I'll put in a good word.

230
00:11:58,733 --> 00:12:01,018
No! This is crazy.

231
00:12:01,069 --> 00:12:03,129
I'm not living up here,
and neither are you.

232
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,520
I'm sorry, but I'm telling.

233
00:12:04,571 --> 00:12:06,088
You're not telling anyone.

234
00:12:06,328 --> 00:12:08,396
Do you realise how much
trouble you'd get in?

235
00:12:08,447 --> 00:12:09,605
What are you talking
about, I didn't...

236
00:12:09,656 --> 00:12:10,294
Zoe.

237
00:12:11,487 --> 00:12:13,440
We didn't want to do it.

238
00:12:13,688 --> 00:12:15,703
It was Dewey's idea.

239
00:12:15,754 --> 00:12:17,376
The whole thing.

240
00:12:17,467 --> 00:12:19,660
He tricked us into it.

241
00:12:23,249 --> 00:12:26,183
Why did you make us
do this, Dewey?

242
00:12:31,677 --> 00:12:33,795
Dewey, come get your cookies,

243
00:12:33,846 --> 00:12:36,803
while the chocolate chips
are still warm and melty!

244
00:12:41,328 --> 00:12:42,319
We've lost Dewey.

245
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:44,103
It's the only possible explanation.

246
00:12:44,154 --> 00:12:46,450
He's turned on us, and
he's feeding Mom information.

247
00:12:46,501 --> 00:12:47,492
This is bad.

248
00:12:47,543 --> 00:12:48,215
Real bad.

249
00:12:48,266 --> 00:12:50,059
I know. What does
he have on you?

250
00:12:50,379 --> 00:12:51,211
Oh, man.

251
00:12:51,262 --> 00:12:53,374
I have all kinds of things
going on he might know about.

252
00:12:53,722 --> 00:12:56,416
I have my lost dog scam,
the rat baby farm.

253
00:12:56,689 --> 00:12:58,215
The electrified mailbox
I'm noodling with.

254
00:12:58,266 --> 00:12:59,173
We don't have any choice.

255
00:12:59,224 --> 00:13:00,630
We have to neutralize him.

256
00:13:00,681 --> 00:13:01,789
Yeah, but how?

257
00:13:03,273 --> 00:13:06,080
Okay, we let him overhear
something we're planning.

258
00:13:06,268 --> 00:13:07,644
Something way across town.

259
00:13:07,695 --> 00:13:09,384
We make it so juicy
and harmless-sounding,

260
00:13:09,435 --> 00:13:10,993
he won't be able
to resist telling Mom.

261
00:13:11,172 --> 00:13:13,581
So, she waits in the cold
for three or four hours,

262
00:13:13,632 --> 00:13:16,186
and when nothing happens,
he's lost all his credibility.

263
00:13:16,843 --> 00:13:17,772
Nice.

264
00:13:31,486 --> 00:13:35,570
Ready to go to the sewerage treatment
plant and do some unwanted vandalism?

265
00:13:35,674 --> 00:13:37,482
Yes, I've got the shovels and

266
00:13:37,533 --> 00:13:40,387
the flares for the senseless
destruction we've got planned.

267
00:13:40,596 --> 00:13:43,014
I sure hope Mom doesn't
ever find out.

268
00:13:43,065 --> 00:13:45,972
Oh, don't worry about Mom.
She's too stupid.

269
00:13:46,023 --> 00:13:49,356
And besides, she's probably
busy stuffing her fat face.

270
00:13:49,694 --> 00:13:52,671
I sure hope Mom doesn't ever
find out you said that.

271
00:13:52,953 --> 00:13:56,999
By the way, do you think
she's gotten stupider or fatter?

272
00:13:57,263 --> 00:13:59,824
Good question. I'd say...

273
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:01,922
All right honey,
I'm going to the park.

274
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:07,956
Oh, I hate ab days.
They keep pulling me in to judge.

275
00:14:08,007 --> 00:14:11,776
All I know, is somebody's tummy is not
going to be as flat as somebody else's,

276
00:14:11,827 --> 00:14:13,555
and somebody's going to end up crying.

277
00:14:14,081 --> 00:14:16,325
Look at this, Hal, they still
haven't found those kids.

278
00:14:16,757 --> 00:14:17,363
You're kidding.

279
00:14:17,414 --> 00:14:19,894
This is terrible.
Where could they be?

280
00:14:20,496 --> 00:14:23,951
All those kids are such messes, they don't
know how to take care of themselves.

281
00:14:24,214 --> 00:14:25,904
Someone has to help them.

282
00:14:31,081 --> 00:14:33,061
Someone will help them, Lois.

283
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:37,174
As a matter of fact, I think someone's
gonna help the crap out of those kids.

284
00:15:53,057 --> 00:15:56,490
Okay, Dewey, our next pizza delivery
comes with a free collectible cap.

285
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:57,720
This has to stop!

286
00:15:57,771 --> 00:16:01,549
I haven't slept in four days!
You guys have to come down!

287
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,324
Why, it's going great.

288
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:04,620
Going great?

289
00:16:04,671 --> 00:16:06,482
You guys are on milk cartons!

290
00:16:06,934 --> 00:16:08,285
This is serious now.

291
00:16:08,336 --> 00:16:09,853
Everyone's looking for you.

292
00:16:09,904 --> 00:16:11,553
The cops, your parents.

293
00:16:11,604 --> 00:16:13,450
Shiny giants in Speedos.

294
00:16:13,501 --> 00:16:14,646
Doesn't matter.

295
00:16:14,956 --> 00:16:16,642
We have a better life up here.

296
00:16:16,693 --> 00:16:18,880
The fairies take care of us.

297
00:16:19,626 --> 00:16:22,236
Mom's right,
I do have crazy eyes.

298
00:16:22,678 --> 00:16:24,035
It's going to be winter soon.

299
00:16:24,086 --> 00:16:25,726
The leaves are going
to fall off the trees.

300
00:16:25,777 --> 00:16:27,256
People will be able to see you!

301
00:16:27,307 --> 00:16:29,751
We've thought of that.
We're gonna head south.

302
00:16:29,802 --> 00:16:32,098
There's a string of
trees along Highway 8.

303
00:16:32,149 --> 00:16:34,740
We may lose a few kids
to predators and stuff,

304
00:16:34,957 --> 00:16:37,069
but they'll know they died free.

305
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:43,245
Okay, guys, drink a little,
but keep moving.

306
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,020
I guess we should
go back out again.

307
00:16:47,547 --> 00:16:48,222
Dad,

308
00:16:48,495 --> 00:16:50,857
when you've finished watering you men,
can I ask you something?

309
00:16:50,908 --> 00:16:52,274
Well, go ahead, son.
What is it?

310
00:16:52,325 --> 00:16:54,006
I've got this decision to make.

311
00:16:54,626 --> 00:16:57,267
There's a lot of people depending on me,
and I'm not sure what to do.

312
00:16:57,318 --> 00:16:59,896
That's the part of leadership
no-one talks about, son.

313
00:16:59,947 --> 00:17:01,624
You think it's gonna be all parades,

314
00:17:01,675 --> 00:17:05,605
and strong men carrying you around
in one of those fancy Sultan do-dads.

315
00:17:05,656 --> 00:17:08,825
But what they don't tell you about,
is the crushing responsibility.

316
00:17:08,876 --> 00:17:11,636
Men who expect nothing
in return, but

317
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:14,491
an able general,
who could lead them to victory.

318
00:17:18,278 --> 00:17:20,897
And instead,
you break their hearts.

319
00:17:24,174 --> 00:17:24,953
Men,

320
00:17:25,886 --> 00:17:27,603
I've been wasting your time.

321
00:17:27,848 --> 00:17:29,594
You deserve better than me.

322
00:17:30,289 --> 00:17:31,228
I've let you down.

323
00:17:32,402 --> 00:17:33,904
You haven't let us down.

324
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:36,195
We've let you down.

325
00:17:36,653 --> 00:17:40,024
You're the smartest man in the world,
and we let you down.

326
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,657
It's all our fault.

327
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,540
We're weak.

328
00:17:45,076 --> 00:17:45,949
Weak.

329
00:17:46,917 --> 00:17:48,710
Weak little girls.

330
00:17:56,682 --> 00:17:58,287
Does this mean I'm a daddy?

331
00:18:02,673 --> 00:18:03,589
Hero?

332
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,170
I wouldn't say hero.

333
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:07,714
But you can, if you want.

334
00:18:07,825 --> 00:18:09,258
I just don't understand, I mean,

335
00:18:09,309 --> 00:18:13,064
what on earth could have possibly
possessed you children to do this?

336
00:18:17,234 --> 00:18:18,557
What do you expect?

337
00:18:18,885 --> 00:18:19,879
We're creepy.

338
00:18:20,133 --> 00:18:21,504
Yeah, we are.

339
00:18:22,021 --> 00:18:24,420
Well, I think the first thing
we have to do is eliminate

340
00:18:24,471 --> 00:18:26,317
the things that get
you over-excited.

341
00:18:26,368 --> 00:18:29,438
I think maybe your recess time might
be what put you over the edge.

342
00:18:29,655 --> 00:18:32,143
Wait, they didn't mean
to get everyone so upset.

343
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:32,607
They just wanted...

344
00:18:32,663 --> 00:18:34,925
Thank you, Dewey, it's really
not your concern any more.

345
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:40,465
It was nice while it lasted.

346
00:18:41,508 --> 00:18:43,429
What do you mean,
not my concern?

347
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:46,415
How come nobody even cares
about any of my concerns?

348
00:18:46,466 --> 00:18:47,833
Dewey, what are you doing?

349
00:18:47,884 --> 00:18:50,593
I've got so much feelings
running through my head,

350
00:18:50,644 --> 00:18:52,247
and I can't get any
of them straight,

351
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:54,097
and they're pounding,
and they're pounding!

352
00:18:54,148 --> 00:18:56,279
And they're after my ***!

353
00:18:57,098 --> 00:18:58,731
The kid's gotta do some
work out on his labs.

354
00:18:59,783 --> 00:19:02,634
Dewey, knock it off!
Stop it this instant!

355
00:19:02,685 --> 00:19:03,798
I hate it! And the people!

356
00:19:03,849 --> 00:19:05,313
And the people, and the hands!

357
00:19:07,156 --> 00:19:08,939
He's normally not like this!

358
00:19:11,672 --> 00:19:13,696
I think it might be
best for everyone if

359
00:19:13,747 --> 00:19:16,086
Dewey goes back into
the special needs class.

360
00:19:16,137 --> 00:19:17,413
Just for a while.

361
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:20,461
See you later, honey.

362
00:19:20,512 --> 00:19:21,545
I'm going to the park.

363
00:19:21,649 --> 00:19:24,602
Hal, it's that job
you interviewed for last week.

364
00:19:24,653 --> 00:19:27,216
They saw you on TV,
I think they want to hire you.

365
00:19:28,821 --> 00:19:29,450
Hello?

366
00:19:30,399 --> 00:19:31,450
Thank you.

367
00:19:32,098 --> 00:19:33,309
Well, sure I can.

368
00:19:33,715 --> 00:19:34,560
Thank you.

369
00:19:34,776 --> 00:19:36,406
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

370
00:19:36,457 --> 00:19:37,570
Oh, thank God, I can't believe it.

371
00:19:37,621 --> 00:19:38,969
I know, me too.

372
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:41,854
I was starting to worry that neither
of us was going to find a job.

373
00:19:41,905 --> 00:19:44,430
I thought you were going to spend
the rest of your life in the park.

374
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:51,052
Okay, men, quiet down, I have some
important news I have to tell you.

375
00:19:51,155 --> 00:19:53,803
I... got a job.

376
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:01,726
That means I'll be going
to work during the day.

377
00:20:04,938 --> 00:20:09,171
Which means I won't be coming
to the park any more.

378
00:20:09,222 --> 00:20:10,138
Oh, no.

379
00:20:10,189 --> 00:20:11,634
Not coming to the park?

380
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:13,227
We need you, Hal.

381
00:20:13,278 --> 00:20:14,499
What are we going
to do without you?

382
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:16,061
I'm gonna miss you, too.

383
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:19,178
This past week has been one
of the best of my life.

384
00:20:19,999 --> 00:20:22,346
And you'll be fine, I promise.

385
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:26,615
Well, Eddie, look at you.
Using that ATM like old pro!

386
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:28,665
I swear, you've been
doing it all your life.

387
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:30,833
And you, Marcus.

388
00:20:30,884 --> 00:20:34,001
Who's taping Guiding Light
and watching it with dinner?

389
00:20:34,161 --> 00:20:38,010
I know who!
And the rest of you guys.

390
00:20:38,555 --> 00:20:39,578
You're amazing.

391
00:20:40,602 --> 00:20:41,667
Every one of you.

392
00:20:43,311 --> 00:20:46,005
Ah, you greasy goots.

393
00:20:48,851 --> 00:20:50,832
We'll never forget you, Hal.

394
00:20:51,466 --> 00:20:55,277
You did so much for us,
I wish we could pay you back somehow.

395
00:20:55,372 --> 00:20:56,451
Yeah.

396
00:20:59,486 --> 00:21:02,988
Oh, hi. Today's my first day,
I'm not sure where to go.

397
00:21:04,538 --> 00:21:05,092
Oh, it's okay.

398
00:21:05,139 --> 00:21:06,068
They're with me.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
