1
00:00:00,058 --> 00:00:03,632
So, after I was indicted, my wife lost her job

2
00:00:03,747 --> 00:00:05,015
and had a nervous breakdown,

3
00:00:05,246 --> 00:00:09,570
<i>and if that wasn't bad enough, one of our 
sons stole his brother's girlfriend,</i>

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,221
<i>which made him run away from home 
and join the Army.</i>

5
00:00:15,161 --> 00:00:16,775
<i>We don't even know where he is.</i>

6
00:00:16,891 --> 00:00:18,793
We've entered Afghani airspace.

7
00:00:18,966 --> 00:00:22,021
Remember, pull the green cord
before the light green cord.

8
00:00:22,944 --> 00:00:25,019
We're just worried sick about him.

9
00:00:25,751 --> 00:00:28,396
It's just that you feel
so helpless, you know?

10
00:00:29,693 --> 00:00:33,868
Look, I don't set the prices, mister.
They're four bucks a box. Take it or leave it.

11
00:00:34,486 --> 00:00:37,357
All right. Just the <i>Thin Mints</i>.

12
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:43,500
Malcolm in the Middle - 6.01 - Reese Comes Home

13
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:50,500
Synchronisation par Mark,
Relecture par Tyno.

14
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:57,500
Forom.com & Malcolm-France.com

15
00:01:11,049 --> 00:01:14,909
It doesn't have to be tuna surprise.
It can be chicken surprise, or beef,

16
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:16,809
but there will be a surprise involved.

17
00:01:17,603 --> 00:01:19,636
You know, we can wait for Mom to make dinner.

18
00:01:20,052 --> 00:01:24,659
I'm sorry, she went to talk with some Army
administrator about Reese. She'll be gone for hours.

19
00:01:24,815 --> 00:01:29,324
<i>Get your hands off me! 
Your authority stops at my property line!</i>

20
00:01:35,634 --> 00:01:36,650
What did she do?

21
00:01:36,806 --> 00:01:38,396
She completely destroyed an office,

22
00:01:38,544 --> 00:01:40,724
made explicit threats against the United States Army,

23
00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:44,167
attacked my groinage region and captured same.

24
00:01:45,171 --> 00:01:49,335
Listen, maybe there's a way
we can make this whole thing go away.

25
00:01:49,688 --> 00:01:52,344
Sir, if she comes within 500 feet of my perimeter

26
00:01:52,803 --> 00:01:54,934
I've been given the authority to engage.

27
00:01:56,139 --> 00:01:58,910
- Mom, what happened?
- I'll tell you what happened.

28
00:01:59,968 --> 00:02:05,690
I told them how my underage son ran away and joined 
the Army under false pretenses and was sent off to combat

29
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:06,501
and you know what they said?

30
00:02:06,567 --> 00:02:11,928
They said if you can find out what name he used,
they can have him back to us in six months.

31
00:02:11,985 --> 00:02:13,527
Six months!

32
00:02:14,002 --> 00:02:16,724
They'll have him back to us in six months.

33
00:02:17,994 --> 00:02:20,765
I don't know if she's upset he's gonna get killed,
or met someone else is gonna do it.

34
00:02:20,806 --> 00:02:26,036
- Honey, you know you're gonna lose a nail inside your palm again. 
just calm down and let the Army...
- I don't trust the Army,

35
00:02:26,094 --> 00:02:30,783
which means this family has to find him, and
I don't trust this family, which means I have to find him.

36
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:36,949
- Two Purple Hearts and a Bronze Star?
- And he blubbered like a baby.

37
00:02:37,506 --> 00:02:40,179
The Army. What do you expect
of people who would give Reese a gun?

38
00:02:40,859 --> 00:02:44,171
Oh, that's right. It's the Army's fault
if your brother gets killed.

39
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:48,991
Now, Lois, we can't blame Malcolm for stealing
Reese's girl and causing this whole mess in the first place.

40
00:02:49,954 --> 00:02:53,757
Kids his age are nothing but raging hormones
and hideous self-involvement.

41
00:02:54,282 --> 00:02:56,151
They are all amoral little creeps.

42
00:02:56,192 --> 00:02:58,848
Don't defend him, Hal. Just help me make dinner.

43
00:03:03,562 --> 00:03:06,809
Great, "angry meat loaf". Thanks a lot.

44
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:10,894
We don't have to worry about Reese.

45
00:03:11,549 --> 00:03:14,714
All he has to do is lay low and not do anything stupid.

46
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:16,675
Oh, God.

47
00:03:19,881 --> 00:03:24,226
I'm a lean, mean fighting machine.
I'm a lean, mean fighting machine.

48
00:03:24,767 --> 00:03:25,554
I'm a robot.

49
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:27,710
Robots are cool.

50
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:29,956
Green Lantern fought a robot.

51
00:03:31,104 --> 00:03:32,399
I love Green Lantern.

52
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:33,858
I love pie.

53
00:03:35,309 --> 00:03:36,096
Pie...

54
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,358
Pie...

55
00:03:39,162 --> 00:03:40,309
Pie...

56
00:03:40,908 --> 00:03:43,646
Why am I thinking about pie?
I'm supposed to be thinking about something else.

57
00:03:44,236 --> 00:03:45,777
Does it rhyme with "pie"?

58
00:03:46,655 --> 00:03:47,229
Buy?

59
00:03:47,721 --> 00:03:48,229
Cry?

60
00:03:48,737 --> 00:03:49,295
Die?

61
00:03:49,721 --> 00:03:50,311
High?

62
00:03:51,098 --> 00:03:51,557
Pie?

63
00:03:52,016 --> 00:03:52,656
Pie!

64
00:03:54,582 --> 00:03:55,221
Pie?

65
00:03:55,779 --> 00:03:56,664
Green Lantern.

66
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:57,959
Fighting robot.

67
00:03:58,172 --> 00:03:59,008
Fighting machine.

68
00:03:59,386 --> 00:03:59,861
Me...

69
00:04:00,728 --> 00:04:01,777
I'm a fighting machine.

70
00:04:02,285 --> 00:04:06,876
I'm a lean, mean fighting machine.
I'm a lean, mean fighting machine.

71
00:04:26,227 --> 00:04:26,850
What is that?

72
00:04:28,899 --> 00:04:31,457
I made a list of every bad thing
Reese ever did to me.

73
00:04:32,286 --> 00:04:32,942
A list?

74
00:04:33,024 --> 00:04:34,778
I'm sick of having to defend myself!

75
00:04:34,991 --> 00:04:39,320
No matter what I did to Reese, he's done
way worse stuff to me, and it's all here on this list.

76
00:04:40,763 --> 00:04:42,648
So we're admitting we have lists?

77
00:04:47,789 --> 00:04:50,691
Mine starts January '95. When does yours start?

78
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:56,477
October 3, 1996: my first knuckle pizza.

79
00:04:56,973 --> 00:05:00,170
July 10, 1997: my first atomic swirly.

80
00:05:00,514 --> 00:05:01,793
The big bruise of '99.

81
00:05:02,187 --> 00:05:03,318
"Backyard Dentist",

82
00:05:03,638 --> 00:05:07,081
"Lighter Fluid Donut". That's worse 
than stealing a girlfriend, right?

83
00:05:07,655 --> 00:05:10,376
I don't know; were you in love
for the first time with that donut?

84
00:05:10,713 --> 00:05:12,680
Shut up, Dewey. I had every right.

85
00:05:13,058 --> 00:05:14,336
In fact, I owe him.

86
00:05:14,795 --> 00:05:16,435
So you're saying if he dies,
then you'll be even?

87
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:18,230
I didn't say he was going to die!

88
00:05:18,378 --> 00:05:24,034
- Malcolm, he almost killed himself with Bisquick once.
- I'm just saying he deserves whatever he gets.

89
00:05:26,545 --> 00:05:27,873
No, he doesn't.

90
00:05:28,316 --> 00:05:29,775
That's something Reese would say.

91
00:05:30,398 --> 00:05:31,398
I'm not Reese.

92
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:34,648
Just because he's horrible doesn't
mean I have to be. I'm better than that.

93
00:05:35,312 --> 00:05:38,264
Wow, for a brother-killer, you sure are conceited.

94
00:05:41,861 --> 00:05:46,151
Oh, uh, excuse me. Hi, uh, Sergeant Rick.
I'm wondering if you can help me.

95
00:05:46,193 --> 00:05:49,889
My son is underaged, and 
I think you may have recruited him.

96
00:05:50,229 --> 00:05:51,015
Take a look.

97
00:05:51,558 --> 00:05:54,000
- Oh, yeah, Private Jetson.
- Oh! Yeah.

98
00:05:54,382 --> 00:05:55,912
Well, let's see, uh...

99
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:59,289
He was sent to Fort Roberts.
I'll get you the address.

100
00:05:59,344 --> 00:06:04,144
Oh, I really appreciate this. I just don't understand
what would make him go and do a crazy thing like this.

101
00:06:04,507 --> 00:06:10,496
Well, the truth is is today's Army's a pretty attractive package.
Competitive salaries, health benefits, college tuition...

102
00:06:11,356 --> 00:06:14,054
Lois, I didn't sign anything. Just hear me out.

103
00:06:14,563 --> 00:06:18,110
It's only two weekends a month,
plus we might qualify for a housing allowance.

104
00:06:18,849 --> 00:06:24,754
Okay, there's a slight possibility of active duty, but Sergeant Rick
expects global events to stabilize in the next three months.

105
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:38,035
Excuse me?!

106
00:06:38,332 --> 00:06:39,564
What do you want?

107
00:06:39,925 --> 00:06:42,729
I'm Malcolm. I'm here Monday, Wednesday, Friday, 3:00 to 7:00.

108
00:06:43,393 --> 00:06:48,087
No one volunteers here. They're all signing up
for the glamorous jobs at the burn unit.

109
00:06:48,851 --> 00:06:50,550
I just want to do something to help veterans.

110
00:06:51,113 --> 00:06:53,534
Really? You think you can handle helping around here?

111
00:06:54,214 --> 00:06:56,953
How 'bout trying to give Mr. Skoros a sponge bath?

112
00:07:00,521 --> 00:07:01,116
Sure.

113
00:07:02,764 --> 00:07:05,355
Or maybe you'd prefer to clip Mr. Deepmarth toenails.

114
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:07,840
Okay.

115
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:12,396
Or how 'bout going room to room emptying bed pans
and stanching bed sores?

116
00:07:13,246 --> 00:07:16,007
You know, I think I can save us
both a little time here.

117
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:17,663
This is how I see it playing out:

118
00:07:17,762 --> 00:07:21,627
you're keep thinking of worse and worse jobs for me to do,
and you know what? I'm going to do them,

119
00:07:22,031 --> 00:07:23,326
all of them, no matter what.

120
00:07:23,794 --> 00:07:25,620
Why? It doesn't matter. I have my reasons.

121
00:07:26,177 --> 00:07:28,025
So go ahead, knock yourself out.

122
00:07:29,385 --> 00:07:30,935
Well, it kind of takes some of the fun out of it,

123
00:07:31,169 --> 00:07:31,976
but okay.

124
00:07:32,209 --> 00:07:34,822
You can start the afternoon enemas with Mr. Klegman.

125
00:07:36,223 --> 00:07:37,285
It'll be my pleasure.

126
00:08:13,222 --> 00:08:14,975
It's about my son, Reese.

127
00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:18,863
Um, I think you know him as Private Jetson.

128
00:08:20,627 --> 00:08:21,796
Private Jetson.

129
00:08:22,829 --> 00:08:24,162
Ma'am, let me shake your hand.

130
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:28,994
That boy is oldier that this old dogface
ever had the privilege of commanding.

131
00:08:29,264 --> 00:08:32,146
I wish I had a hundred more just like him.
He's a fine boy.

132
00:08:32,798 --> 00:08:33,777
Yes, well...

133
00:08:34,253 --> 00:08:35,258
we think so, too.

134
00:08:35,498 --> 00:08:38,584
I'd be proud to help you in any way that I can.
Now you just name it.

135
00:08:38,734 --> 00:08:43,614
The problem is he joined under false pretenses.
He ran away; he's not even 18 years old yet.

136
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:47,107
We need to know where he is so we can find him
and bring him back home.

137
00:08:47,977 --> 00:08:51,293
I'm sorry, ma'am, I can't help you. That's classified.

138
00:08:52,397 --> 00:08:54,341
If your son were on a secret mission,

139
00:08:54,558 --> 00:08:56,665
which I'm not saying he is nor that one exists,

140
00:08:56,754 --> 00:08:58,358
it would compromise said mission

141
00:08:58,602 --> 00:09:00,519
if indeed there were one.

142
00:09:01,484 --> 00:09:02,884
My hands are tied.

143
00:09:05,143 --> 00:09:06,570
You know, Sergeant,

144
00:09:07,372 --> 00:09:08,677
you and I aren't so different.

145
00:09:09,086 --> 00:09:11,872
I mean, if you think about it,
we both have the same job.

146
00:09:12,319 --> 00:09:18,042
Taking a bunch of mindless, irresponsible teenagers
and turning them into something vaguely useful to the world.

147
00:09:18,597 --> 00:09:20,404
It is a challenge, ma'am.

148
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:24,671
Last week, one of my boys was trying
to iron his shirt while he was still in it.

149
00:09:25,389 --> 00:09:29,875
One of mine interrupted a war game because
his rifle was kind of digging into his shoulder.

150
00:09:31,851 --> 00:09:36,418
- Did you make everyone suffer for what the one kid did?
- Of course. But it never lasts, does it?

151
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:40,771
- It is stunning how much punishment they require.
- Tell me about it.

152
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:43,325
I'm amazed I get anything else done.

153
00:09:44,671 --> 00:09:46,520
Did you ever try the opposite?

154
00:09:46,899 --> 00:09:50,256
- What do you mean?
- Give one of them special privileges for no reason.

155
00:09:51,262 --> 00:09:53,437
- How does that work?
- It's really pretty neat.

156
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:58,975
The others don't know why he got special privileges
so they start doing everything right just to catch up.

157
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,986
Then the one you singled out starts
getting suspicious and paranoid

158
00:10:02,217 --> 00:10:05,289
and he starts informing on the stragglers.
- That sounds pretty good.

159
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:08,014
- You mind if I steal that one?
- Yeah, be my guest.

160
00:10:08,512 --> 00:10:14,820
You know another good one? Let them pick punishments for each other.
It exercises their creativity and keeps them from ganging up on you.

161
00:10:14,944 --> 00:10:21,655
- Nice.
- You can also take their breakfast, lunch and dinner, put it the blender
and grind it up into a gray paste. Eventually, they eat it.

162
00:10:21,719 --> 00:10:22,972
That's kind of fun.

163
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:28,381
- You are an artist.
- No, I'm just a talented amateur.

164
00:10:30,866 --> 00:10:32,395
I wish I could help you.

165
00:10:34,112 --> 00:10:39,209
I wish I could just open this drawer up
and show youthe information you need.

166
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:40,887
But I can't.

167
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:44,380
It's got me so frustrated that I just want to

168
00:10:44,614 --> 00:10:47,927
stare intently out this window for, oh, say...

169
00:10:48,373 --> 00:10:50,136
120 seconds.

170
00:11:09,078 --> 00:11:13,316
- What is wrong with these guys? They're just like zombies.
- It's the medication that makes them that way.

171
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:17,829
- Except for Kowalski. I mean, he came to us like that.
- Look, I don't think you should be giving them so much.

172
00:11:17,961 --> 00:11:21,101
I was reading to Donaldson for a half an hour,
then a bee crawled out of his nose.

173
00:11:21,226 --> 00:11:25,464
Believe me, it's better for everyone
to keep these men as calm as possible.

174
00:11:31,922 --> 00:11:33,323
Hey, Ed, you want to play?

175
00:11:35,497 --> 00:11:37,026
Here we go.

176
00:11:37,467 --> 00:11:39,770
You know what, Ed? You can do this.

177
00:11:39,954 --> 00:11:43,750
I believe in you, all right?
I'm here to help you, however long it takes.

178
00:11:45,806 --> 00:11:47,298
Maybe you feel ignored here.

179
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:49,454
Maybe you feel like you don't exist.

180
00:11:50,467 --> 00:11:51,684
I know you exist, Ed.

181
00:11:51,923 --> 00:11:52,789
Let me help you.

182
00:12:00,675 --> 00:12:02,094
Where have you been?

183
00:12:02,226 --> 00:12:05,427
You've been gone all day. You haven't called.
I've been worried sick about you.

184
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:08,122
Well, I have to eat, Lois.

185
00:12:08,214 --> 00:12:11,439
- I'm a human being.
- I'm sorry I'm so late. I had to take the bus home.

186
00:12:11,784 --> 00:12:13,097
I sold the car.

187
00:12:13,444 --> 00:12:16,530
I bought a plane ticket to Kabul. There's $400 left.

188
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:19,778
- I'd give it to you to pay down the Visa bill,
but I need it for bribes.
- What?!

189
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:21,298
I'm gonna go get him.

190
00:12:21,633 --> 00:12:25,663
- What are you talking about? You can't just go get him.
- Yes, I can.

191
00:12:25,762 --> 00:12:31,174
Tonight, I'm gonna buy enough frozen dinners to last you and the
boys for three weeks. Then tomorrow, I'm flying to Kabul.

192
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:34,975
If I don't get anywhere with the Army, 
I'll hire an interpreter and get the locals to help me.

193
00:12:35,124 --> 00:12:38,372
If I have to, I'll make friends with a warlord.
Those guys are pretty organized.

194
00:12:38,464 --> 00:12:39,708
I'll find him, Hal.

195
00:12:39,915 --> 00:12:42,495
And when does the little bird pop out of your head and start singing?

196
00:12:42,633 --> 00:12:44,199
This is what's happening, Hal.

197
00:12:44,475 --> 00:12:45,374
Lois,

198
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,664
you can't do this.

199
00:12:50,566 --> 00:12:54,182
At some point, you have to check your ego
and leave it to the professionals.

200
00:12:54,341 --> 00:13:02,955
- I can't.
- Lois, you have this reckless, crazy belief in yourself that lets you
do amazing things. It's something this family has always depended on.

201
00:13:03,129 --> 00:13:08,197
I would be lost without it, but sometimes that reckless,
crazy belief is just, just...

202
00:13:08,726 --> 00:13:10,131
reckless and crazy!

203
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:13,967
You've got to accept that some people can do things that you can't.

204
00:13:14,151 --> 00:13:19,126
Heart surgeons, rocket scientists, that lady at the mall
who carves your name into a grain of rice.

205
00:13:19,288 --> 00:13:21,683
- How does she do that?
- No one knows.

206
00:13:22,097 --> 00:13:24,078
Honey, honey, look...

207
00:13:25,575 --> 00:13:32,024
I am giving you permission not to be omnipotent.
I know it's gonna be hard, but everything will be okay.

208
00:13:32,532 --> 00:13:33,775
I know it will.

209
00:13:41,514 --> 00:13:43,357
Sarsi or Diet Sarsi?

210
00:13:55,741 --> 00:13:57,123
I can't do it.

211
00:13:58,044 --> 00:13:59,656
I can't go on.

212
00:14:01,706 --> 00:14:04,678
Is this any way to start your morning?

213
00:14:09,379 --> 00:14:10,968
Mr. Waffles?

214
00:14:14,515 --> 00:14:16,335
Reese, you can't give up!

215
00:14:16,425 --> 00:14:17,645
You got to keep going.

216
00:14:17,806 --> 00:14:19,626
You got to keep trying.

217
00:14:20,202 --> 00:14:21,745
You don't know what I've been through.

218
00:14:22,367 --> 00:14:23,380
I've been shot at,

219
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,486
chased,

220
00:14:24,877 --> 00:14:25,684
married,

221
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:29,104
and when the guy found out I was a dude,

222
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:31,108
it wasn't like a total deal breaker.

223
00:14:31,361 --> 00:14:33,112
Son, I know it's hard.

224
00:14:33,319 --> 00:14:35,622
Everything worth doing is hard.

225
00:14:35,869 --> 00:14:39,254
When third quarter profits were down,
did Mr. Waffles give up?

226
00:14:39,346 --> 00:14:40,913
No, he did not.

227
00:14:41,074 --> 00:14:44,229
He put more lip-smacking delight in every bite!

228
00:14:44,322 --> 00:14:45,289
I don't think I can move.

229
00:14:45,369 --> 00:14:50,805
You have to move, Reese. You have to get home
to your family and friends and your country.

230
00:14:50,897 --> 00:14:53,799
These people have no idea what breakfast is.

231
00:14:53,889 --> 00:14:58,081
They take rice from the night before
and cook it up into a thin paste.

232
00:14:58,196 --> 00:15:00,500
Is that your idea of breakfast?

233
00:15:00,615 --> 00:15:01,559
No,

234
00:15:02,354 --> 00:15:05,808
but...
- Do you ever want to taste my buttery goodness again?

235
00:15:05,901 --> 00:15:07,075
You know I do.

236
00:15:07,352 --> 00:15:13,179
Reese, listen to me.
I now have 20% more blueberries in every box.

237
00:15:13,305 --> 00:15:14,227
My legs.

238
00:15:14,342 --> 00:15:17,129
They plump up in the batter!

239
00:15:17,382 --> 00:15:19,824
They're so juicy that way!

240
00:15:23,285 --> 00:15:24,828
I'm coming home!

241
00:15:25,128 --> 00:15:27,500
I'm proud of you, son.

242
00:15:27,707 --> 00:15:29,343
Whatever happened to Mrs. Waffles?

243
00:15:29,527 --> 00:15:32,107
- She was hot.
- Yes, she was.

244
00:15:32,285 --> 00:15:37,559
But she didn't increase product awareness
in girls 3 to 18 a single percent.

245
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:15,223
Nurse Peterson,

246
00:16:15,315 --> 00:16:18,609
you'll be interested to know I took everyone's tranquilizers
and flushed them down the toilet.

247
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:21,273
- What?
- I came here to help because I owe someone something,

248
00:16:21,411 --> 00:16:22,654
a soldier like these men.

249
00:16:22,793 --> 00:16:26,616
I didn't come here to stand by and do nothing
while you crush their spirits with chemicals.

250
00:16:26,744 --> 00:16:30,014
- He deserved better, and they deserve better.
- What the hell is wrong with you?

251
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:32,571
You can't take these men off their sedatives.

252
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:37,958
Oh, my God. Security!

253
00:16:40,743 --> 00:16:42,631
Guys, please calm down. Guys!

254
00:16:49,672 --> 00:16:50,886
- You've got to stop.
- Come on, come on!

255
00:16:50,933 --> 00:16:52,372
You have to...

256
00:16:56,276 --> 00:16:57,797
Oh, I don't want to hear it.

257
00:16:58,056 --> 00:17:02,699
Isn't it bad enough with your mother gone and your brother missing?
You have to go out brawling in the streets?

258
00:17:04,379 --> 00:17:05,834
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

259
00:17:07,824 --> 00:17:10,846
Wait a minute. This is our dinner.

260
00:17:15,584 --> 00:17:17,021
Well, good news.

261
00:17:17,297 --> 00:17:19,637
God decided I don't deserve to redeem myself.

262
00:17:19,987 --> 00:17:23,174
I get to carry this soul-crushing guilt
for the rest of my life.

263
00:17:23,856 --> 00:17:24,372
Yeah.

264
00:17:24,685 --> 00:17:27,210
I've been trying to compose a requiem for him.

265
00:17:27,454 --> 00:17:30,550
It's hard getting in the right mood using a glitter marker.

266
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:34,843
- Maybe we've been trying to honor Reese the wrong way.
- What do you mean?

267
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:37,871
Reese wasn't into helping people and doing good deeds.

268
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:40,911
He loved to smash stuff and destroy things for no reason.

269
00:17:41,114 --> 00:17:42,477
If we're gonna honor Reese,

270
00:17:42,624 --> 00:17:44,338
maybe we should think about doing it his way.

271
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:45,978
You have something in mind?

272
00:17:46,549 --> 00:17:47,839
This kind of caught my eye.

273
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,865
An art fair?

274
00:17:50,328 --> 00:17:52,281
Just think what Reese would have done with this.

275
00:17:52,539 --> 00:17:56,556
They've got drift wood art, yarn owls, dream catchers,

276
00:17:56,814 --> 00:17:59,098
face painting, folk dancing.

277
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:00,887
They are kind of begging for it.

278
00:18:01,826 --> 00:18:02,969
I don't know.

279
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:04,664
There's rapping grannies.

280
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:06,304
Let me see that.

281
00:18:07,907 --> 00:18:13,324
Let me go, please! Come on. How was I supposed
to know it was your god? It looked like a monkey man!

282
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:19,024
You're gonna regret this! If my husband finds out, he'll make you pay.

283
00:18:19,184 --> 00:18:21,003
Then you'll really be sorry.

284
00:18:23,652 --> 00:18:24,666
Mom?

285
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,167
Thank you so much. There you are.

286
00:18:29,168 --> 00:18:32,600
What in the name of God were you thinking?!

287
00:18:32,669 --> 00:18:34,926
Look at you. You are filthy.

288
00:18:35,109 --> 00:18:38,540
Your nails are a disgrace.
You've been tomb robbing!

289
00:18:38,771 --> 00:18:43,631
Well, the fun stops now, young man! 
You are in so much trouble!

290
00:18:57,091 --> 00:18:59,279
I just can't believe he could really be gone.

291
00:18:59,947 --> 00:19:01,168
I know.

292
00:19:03,863 --> 00:19:06,005
Wow, this diaper's got to be a five-pounder.

293
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:08,827
I'd like to think Jamie knew what it was for.

294
00:19:10,808 --> 00:19:12,259
It's so weird.

295
00:19:13,203 --> 00:19:16,359
It seems like all my life I've wished
for something horrible to happen to Reese,

296
00:19:17,097 --> 00:19:18,755
and now that it has I...

297
00:19:20,068 --> 00:19:22,417
- I...
- Miss him?

298
00:19:22,486 --> 00:19:23,246
Yeah.

299
00:19:26,747 --> 00:19:27,922
I do, too.

300
00:19:28,401 --> 00:19:33,330
Remember when he shaved my eyebrows 
and glued them back on so I looked permanently surprised?

301
00:19:34,113 --> 00:19:35,840
That was genius.

302
00:19:42,797 --> 00:19:47,219
Remember that look of pure joy he'd get on
Christmas morning when he was smashing our presents?

303
00:19:47,334 --> 00:19:48,832
<i>It's in my eyes!</i>

304
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:51,402
No matter how hard I tried,

305
00:19:51,701 --> 00:19:54,857
I could never make Mom's face
turn that special purple color.

306
00:19:55,985 --> 00:19:56,976
Reese purple.

307
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:01,649
Why couldn't I have said something meaningful
to him before he...

308
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:04,874
Don't do this to yourself.

309
00:20:12,471 --> 00:20:13,761
He would have liked this.

310
00:20:14,985 --> 00:20:16,782
I only wish he could have been here to see it.

311
00:20:16,851 --> 00:20:18,348
Me, too.

312
00:20:19,569 --> 00:20:20,605
Reese!

313
00:20:20,951 --> 00:20:22,425
You're not dead!

314
00:20:22,563 --> 00:20:25,005
I can't believe it. Reese, I'm so glad to see you.

315
00:20:25,232 --> 00:20:27,351
All right, all right. Don't 'mo me.

316
00:20:27,973 --> 00:20:28,940
How does this work?

317
00:20:29,332 --> 00:20:33,662
- Oh, well, we have the remote here,
and you pick out a good one...
- Here.

318
00:20:33,805 --> 00:20:36,984
We were saving this one. 
It's from when Jamie had swine flu.

319
00:20:37,145 --> 00:20:38,297
Nice.

320
00:20:51,963 --> 00:20:53,852
God, I love this country.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
