1
00:00:05,485 --> 00:00:09,167
Dewey you mind getting me a pair of socks at the bottom of my drawer?

2
00:00:10,428 --> 00:00:10,828
Agree

3
00:00:12,742 --> 00:00:13,916
No mine is the top one

4
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:18,671
No this is the first! the top one just before you!

5
00:00:19,919 --> 00:00:22,147
this is your drawer! one next door

6
00:00:22,671 --> 00:00:24,855
Across

7
00:00:25,475 --> 00:00:26,678
Not behind idiot!

8
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:30,148
It is not complicated to open the drawer

9
00:00:34,677 --> 00:00:35,789
You idiot Dewey

10
00:01:12,802 --> 00:01:16,553
After two months of unemployment, Mom resigned herself to go begging
his former bosses to take

11
00:01:16,573 --> 00:01:19,779
they finally return to the store to test

12
00:01:20,183 --> 00:01:24,175
Remember the lesson Malcolm, when you want to wear a gown you need to know to take upon himself

13
00:01:24,566 --> 00:01:26,611
I forgot how good it was going to me ...

14
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:27,673
Honey ...

15
00:01:28,549 --> 00:01:30,037
I have a surprise ...

16
00:01:30,136 --> 00:01:33,918
It is already late I have to be careful as I am testing ...

17
00:01:33,918 --> 00:01:34,944
It's worth it!

18
00:01:41,613 --> 00:01:43,153
It is a playground for cats ...

19
00:01:43,264 --> 00:01:46,254
you always say that we have no reason
to have a chat ...

20
00:01:46,254 --> 00:01:47,648
Now ... we have one!

21
00:01:48,542 --> 00:01:53,006
There's a ball at the end of a wire, two bridges,
an activity center, and a platform for monitoring
other cats ...

22
00:01:53,762 --> 00:01:55,504
I called the world of cats!

23
00:02:00,438 --> 00:02:02,250
Whenever I have an idea
it considers the poor

24
00:02:04,745 --> 00:02:06,377
Is it going to snow?

25
00:02:06,377 --> 00:02:09,589
I do not think it has not snowed
very long

26
00:02:09,766 --> 00:02:12,470
Sometimes things change, we could have

27
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:14,500
I want it to snow

28
00:02:14,909 --> 00:02:19,546
I can not take it out but your
mother requires ...

29
00:02:20,005 --> 00:02:20,831
It is a little too big

30
00:02:21,178 --> 00:02:23,028
You sure that the garbage will
take?

31
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:24,186
I know they will ...

32
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,575
Why ... I bought them a pack of beer ...

33
00:02:28,371 --> 00:02:31,861
This is the best thing I managed to do ...

34
00:02:32,951 --> 00:02:34,282
Dewey we go ...

35
00:02:38,382 --> 00:02:40,557
You've worked here two months ago?

36
00:02:40,557 --> 00:02:44,050
Yes I have worked here for twelve
years ...

37
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:45,572
This ... is poised to be a record ...

38
00:02:45,572 --> 00:02:51,024
The chief said that all employees during
test are required to put this badge ...

39
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:55,894
Yeah .. big

40
00:02:55,894 --> 00:02:58,080
I have known several testing periods as Lois ...

41
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:08,902
All humiliations ... should not they get to you
try to break your spirit with their badge and
draconian health tests ...

42
00:03:08,902 --> 00:03:14,635
In fact ... they changed the code toilets for women
it is 4569260305

43
00:03:16,162 --> 00:03:21,212
ah and men is 459929

44
00:03:21,671 --> 00:03:23,233
And shit ...

45
00:03:24,514 --> 00:03:26,953
zero body 2 ...

46
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,763
I'm sure you're good
in a lot of areas!

47
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:55,767
What is this?

48
00:03:56,046 --> 00:03:58,066
New ad campaign
of alcohol-free beer

49
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,915
This is very shocking as panel ...

50
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:00,887
Nope

51
00:04:01,359 --> 00:04:05,151
It is a black sweeper with a broom and
a pack of beer in his hand ...

52
00:04:05,518 --> 00:04:08,950
Well, I do not know if my scanner
it may have spilled something ...

53
00:04:10,789 --> 00:04:12,433
It is called Dopey?

54
00:04:12,783 --> 00:04:14,616
Surely a tribute to the old cartoon

55
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,846
I'll throw it in the trash ... yeah

56
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:18,616
If you get caught I'm not aware of anything

57
00:04:18,616 --> 00:04:21,965
And I would have loved to be called cheesy at my age!

58
00:04:25,006 --> 00:04:26,264
Garbage collectors have left

59
00:04:26,857 --> 00:04:27,763
No

60
00:04:28,352 --> 00:04:28,891
Where are the beers?

61
00:04:28,891 --> 00:04:29,879
He picked ...

62
00:04:29,953 --> 00:04:32,355
He drank one and poured the other in his thermos ...

63
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:35,433
He left it here to make fun of me ...

64
00:04:35,433 --> 00:04:36,642
Maybe we should be cut into pieces ...

65
00:04:36,642 --> 00:04:43,923
No Dewey is not going to make him what I am well pleased
my soul and my heart to build this thing for all that
a garbage man refuses to take

66
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:47,615
There are principles that must ... Oh! scram!

67
00:04:50,618 --> 00:04:52,741
The company entered a spin ..

68
00:05:00,413 --> 00:05:01,285
What are you doing?

69
00:05:01,747 --> 00:05:06,062
This is to replace one that was stolen is
Greg who has to take it to believe it
had a friend

70
00:05:06,337 --> 00:05:09,216
Nobody stole it is I who put in
the trunk

71
00:05:09,457 --> 00:05:12,404
Mom, I remind you that you are in a period
Test

72
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:15,536
This ad is racist and insulting limit
it has nothing to do in this store

73
00:05:16,311 --> 00:05:17,714
But the boss asked me to give

74
00:05:20,831 --> 00:05:22,205
Well I'm telling you to remove

75
00:05:22,907 --> 00:05:26,609
I can not you're not my boss

76
00:05:26,609 --> 00:05:30,134
It is not he who brought you into this world
I know

77
00:05:30,134 --> 00:05:32,276
So are you gonna take that thing
yes or no?

78
00:05:33,801 --> 00:05:35,659
No

79
00:05:42,057 --> 00:05:43,971
It is not going to follow me?

80
00:05:46,742 --> 00:05:48,715
Excuse me, excuse me

81
00:05:51,414 --> 00:05:52,121
Yes

82
00:05:52,121 --> 00:05:55,111
You remember I
deposited it in front of me there is already
one week

83
00:05:55,111 --> 00:05:56,452
I left because it was too big

84
00:05:56,452 --> 00:06:01,944
But you took the beers that were above
it was thanks

85
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:04,924
Actually I thought it was to apologize

86
00:06:05,195 --> 00:06:05,944
How does an apology?

87
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:08,496
Why should you apologize?

88
00:06:08,744 --> 00:06:10,936
Because you are real pigs

89
00:06:10,936 --> 00:06:16,721
half of what you throw not even served

90
00:06:17,362 --> 00:06:20,645
and nine months after your wife has forgotten three
pills that you put the plate with
your panties layer

91
00:06:21,165 --> 00:06:27,201
you have a strange sense of priorities at home,
you buy low quality layers but
every Friday you offer chocolates

92
00:06:27,201 --> 00:06:29,573
So tell what's in our garbage does not concern you!

93
00:06:30,918 --> 00:06:34,958
Forget that we erase everything and start again,
we behave like civilized people

94
00:06:35,885 --> 00:06:37,183
you do very hard work

95
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,711
I respect that

96
00:06:39,272 --> 00:06:41,241
Hey Oscar, good appetite

97
00:06:48,456 --> 00:06:50,313
He farts a lot for a dustman

98
00:06:56,648 --> 00:06:57,899
Case two

99
00:07:08,288 --> 00:07:09,134
What is this?

100
00:07:09,935 --> 00:07:11,178
I thought them all torn

101
00:07:11,178 --> 00:07:15,081
I still negative, it is a reminder of
the former Malcolm who can distinguish
between good and evil

102
00:07:15,081 --> 00:07:18,088
This is not because I did not obey you you
have the right to humiliate me

103
00:07:18,088 --> 00:07:19,035
Humiliate you but how?

104
00:07:19,467 --> 00:07:22,450
By posting a photo store
particularly ridiculous to you?

105
00:07:23,297 --> 00:07:25,721
My son also loves to wear costumes
such

106
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:28,150
Call the

107
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:31,406
I removed it immediately!

108
00:07:31,692 --> 00:07:33,348
if you think I'll do what you ask me

109
00:07:33,779 --> 00:07:34,840
you when you refuse to listen to me

110
00:07:35,091 --> 00:07:39,124
will perhaps have to consult your boss because
you do you care that his opinion

111
00:07:41,293 --> 00:07:44,842
"No employee is expected to have effects
in his personal workspace "

112
00:07:45,219 --> 00:07:47,956
Do not worry mom, it does not significantly increase your
test period than a day

113
00:07:50,206 --> 00:07:54,012
I'm sorry Lord,
the regulation that compels me

114
00:07:55,615 --> 00:07:59,694
Now I do not know at all who I am

115
00:08:21,165 --> 00:08:23,100
That's for you

116
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:35,817
I must admit that I had
not seen it coming the

117
00:08:43,805 --> 00:08:47,237
Health services of the city ensure we
our garbage has an irrefutable alibi compared
the last night

118
00:08:47,237 --> 00:08:52,640
and if I want to get rid of me there alone
$ 1200 takes to the dumpster and
license to drive

119
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,150
I am absolutely certain of not having

120
00:08:58,464 --> 00:09:01,272
Honey, I want you to know that you do not have to
worry

121
00:09:01,586 --> 00:09:04,247
I'll get rid of it though
costs me

122
00:09:05,782 --> 00:09:07,955
Hey! what right you throw your garbage here?

123
00:09:10,876 --> 00:09:17,313
I'm not gonna lie and say
the context is not ideal but if ever
we refuse to live in a battle on a
dumping ground

124
00:09:17,313 --> 00:09:20,337
and not just any worse, that of
mind

125
00:09:21,275 --> 00:09:24,256
I'm sorry for our neighbors and
lawn thoroughly clean

126
00:09:24,256 --> 00:09:27,899
but be careful especially not higher air

127
00:09:32,351 --> 00:09:34,582
And yet there would be so many things to say

128
00:09:35,384 --> 00:09:39,857
such that nothing would have happened if you
we had left to have a chat

129
00:10:24,313 --> 00:10:26,830
It's amazing what people can throw

130
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:28,519
You have closed the door and put the spray?

131
00:10:28,926 --> 00:10:31,141
Just dive in and then you get used to
odor

132
00:10:31,808 --> 00:10:33,158
How do you know if the milk is drinkable

133
00:10:33,572 --> 00:10:34,651
Everything in this house stinks

134
00:10:37,088 --> 00:10:40,585
The principles do not feel all the pink

135
00:10:40,585 --> 00:10:42,417
we are in this situation

136
00:10:42,417 --> 00:10:44,280
because we fight for these principles

137
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,530
I expect that you stay stoic

138
00:10:46,675 --> 00:10:49,107
Do not worry I will remain stoic

139
00:10:49,655 --> 00:10:51,050
As the mountain of garbage starts
not to decompose

140
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:54,443
and that caffards and maggots do not compete
the rat droppings,

141
00:10:54,972 --> 00:10:56,818
no complaints out of my mouth

142
00:10:57,110 --> 00:11:00,278
I feel that there is a leak, Reese
checks the window

143
00:11:05,504 --> 00:11:06,576
I think I will not take

144
00:11:06,671 --> 00:11:07,671
On the table

145
00:11:12,644 --> 00:11:13,706
Hello Greg, go on road

146
00:11:13,892 --> 00:11:14,999
You go with Greg?

147
00:11:15,431 --> 00:11:16,157
Yes

148
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,621
We could go both

149
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:21,830
Not you think? you gave yourself so much trouble
to deny our family relationship

150
00:11:22,262 --> 00:11:23,610
No it is not at all what I've done

151
00:11:24,526 --> 00:11:27,122
I'm not a little boy I distinguish
between what happens to us

152
00:11:27,573 --> 00:11:28,442
and what happens at work

153
00:11:28,647 --> 00:11:32,107
Ah I see so you can deny all these principles
as it is done for money

154
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:37,329
That's mom, for the damn money. I gave up
all morality and decided to go to hell for $ 6 / hour

155
00:11:37,379 --> 00:11:39,428
You know very well that this pub is absolutely
ignoble

156
00:11:39,453 --> 00:11:40,582
No it is not that much

157
00:11:41,181 --> 00:11:43,335
This is a picture of a guy with a broom and
pack of beer

158
00:11:43,531 --> 00:11:45,119
types that sweep often drink beer

159
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,120
and guys who drink beer are often sweepers

160
00:11:46,949 --> 00:11:47,927
Dopey?

161
00:11:48,273 --> 00:11:51,164
It has tripled sales of non-alcoholic beers,
that's incredible

162
00:11:51,518 --> 00:11:55,572
When I think I raised a son who became
insensitive to what are currently the most important

163
00:11:55,616 --> 00:11:57,932
If I became insensitive to force it to
model you

164
00:11:57,932 --> 00:12:00,859
Stop both,
appointment the unbreathable atmosphere

165
00:12:03,424 --> 00:12:04,734
Come on Greg

166
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:14,715
I think it's nice to take pains
to organize our poker night, it impresses
these tons of garbage in front of you,

167
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:16,800
draw back before you do anything

168
00:12:18,457 --> 00:12:20,575
Even these chips have an amazing flavor

169
00:12:21,973 --> 00:12:24,518
Who distributed this rotten game? I want to be thrown out

170
00:12:26,556 --> 00:12:31,696
I do not know what to do if I give up now,
What image of me will I give to my son?

171
00:12:32,048 --> 00:12:36,576
It is true that the stakes are high, a father
sabotte deliberately authority no longer
no chance

172
00:12:36,576 --> 00:12:39,606
to remain the leader of the mountain
bins

173
00:12:42,231 --> 00:12:43,721
If you please the guy that makes it worth

174
00:12:44,099 --> 00:12:45,467
you should be compassionate

175
00:12:45,996 --> 00:12:49,889
this is not good I have one! you know the
new group in fashion? gulls in the area
the street!

176
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:54,341
Oh no it is not true

177
00:12:55,114 --> 00:12:58,426
If someone looks at my cards I warn you
I know

178
00:13:10,114 --> 00:13:11,007
But what are you doing?

179
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:13,405
I thought I'd show it to our friends

180
00:13:13,717 --> 00:13:16,889
That way you can explain why you are
want to store as

181
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:21,943
I do not like it especially it's my head that I
asked to install

182
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:26,018
You said yourself that it was not so disgusting it

183
00:13:26,018 --> 00:13:29,600
Perhaps you can explain to everyone here how
this thing is not racist

184
00:13:34,724 --> 00:13:38,025
First they pick their cotton and now we
must be used to support their moral dilemmas.

185
00:13:39,282 --> 00:13:43,174
This is probably the most distressing aspect of the enormous
impact that racism had on white

186
00:13:43,678 --> 00:13:48,250
How son and white mothers will have yet
tear before we have finally understood

187
00:13:48,588 --> 00:13:50,513
Already that we have to dance together at weddings

188
00:13:51,354 --> 00:13:53,478
and they are looking to shake their big soft buttocks

189
00:13:55,627 --> 00:14:01,500
Enough now I need your support, you must admit that
it is a cliché representation of African-American man!

190
00:14:10,357 --> 00:14:11,935
You want to know what you really not stand?

191
00:14:12,035 --> 00:14:15,957
It's not what you think I'm biased,
is having to accept that I do not work
you obey the finger and the eye

192
00:14:16,324 --> 00:14:19,867
and as I grow gradually you lose all your
authority over me

193
00:14:20,077 --> 00:14:21,011
you can not stand the idea that one day I am free

194
00:14:21,011 --> 00:14:22,738
I have a dream

195
00:14:23,038 --> 00:14:24,138
Sing my brother sings

196
00:14:24,932 --> 00:14:26,716
You want to talk about what disturbs you deeply?

197
00:14:26,716 --> 00:14:29,154
Is that in the background you know that it is I who am right

198
00:14:29,154 --> 00:14:32,487
you also have a moral sense that you simply try to deny

199
00:14:32,487 --> 00:14:34,135
How dare you talk about morality

200
00:14:34,135 --> 00:14:36,922
While you use this trick to me
ridicule in front of friends Dad?

201
00:14:36,922 --> 00:14:40,457
Is what I told him that you think he realized
he ridiculed

202
00:14:40,457 --> 00:14:42,689
and he would drop this showdown
stupid with the garbage? I told him?

203
00:14:42,689 --> 00:14:44,168
And well no!

204
00:14:44,168 --> 00:14:47,554
because even if I want it to death I will always treat
with a modicum of respect

205
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:50,248
I will realize that I am ridiculed?

206
00:14:50,248 --> 00:14:51,870
Hal it has nothing to do!

207
00:14:52,062 --> 00:14:57,346
If you stay in it, enough stop. Why do you continue to
fighting? This is a very pleasant evening.

208
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:00,830
We came to play
cards so if you please play cards.

209
00:15:02,604 --> 00:15:03,782
Why? what do you got?

210
00:15:04,219 --> 00:15:05,090
Nothing

211
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:17,277
Papa

212
00:15:17,548 --> 00:15:18,863
Dewey?

213
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,475
Yes

214
00:15:22,286 --> 00:15:24,277
Dewey, where are you?

215
00:15:24,277 --> 00:15:25,329
I do not know

216
00:15:25,477 --> 00:15:27,333
I'm surrounded by garbage

217
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:28,235
You breathe well?

218
00:15:28,235 --> 00:15:30,815
It will but it still stinks

219
00:15:31,169 --> 00:15:33,186
Keep digging until you see
light

220
00:15:40,316 --> 00:15:42,467
Well I got your message.

221
00:15:42,467 --> 00:15:44,846
I need a shot
hand I am completely overwhelmed

222
00:15:44,846 --> 00:15:46,298
You did well to call me

223
00:15:46,298 --> 00:15:47,553
You swear that your mother will not know

224
00:15:47,928 --> 00:15:49,095
You have my word

225
00:15:49,095 --> 00:15:56,494
There is a way to solve the troubles you but
I must be sure that you're not going back, he must
Do you really veuilles

226
00:15:56,494 --> 00:15:59,043
Appeal to you shows you that I'm really ready
any

227
00:15:59,189 --> 00:16:04,385
Well, it will, we have passed the point of no return.
We will implement my plan tonight

228
00:16:04,485 --> 00:16:07,655
It is imperative that you're here to 18h

229
00:16:07,655 --> 00:16:10,648
But it is in 20 minutes ... we go now?

230
00:16:11,464 --> 00:16:12,138
Ok

231
00:16:15,052 --> 00:16:18,567
It's not stealing, it's just a loan.
It's not stealing, it's just a loan.

232
00:16:19,049 --> 00:16:25,493
It begins with the garbage of our lawns,
is complete with a container of the hospital and
we will make a visit to a garbage

233
00:16:25,637 --> 00:16:26,891
Dogs and they will come out?

234
00:16:27,471 --> 00:16:30,633
They wake up in half an hour ...
with a slight headache

235
00:16:31,432 --> 00:16:37,921
If only you déployais much determination
and perseverance in your studies, you can
become ... oh no you've missed the boat

236
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:51,340
More than six hours and small farewell this badge

237
00:16:51,581 --> 00:16:55,857
the last 6 hours are a kind of area
all hazards

238
00:16:55,857 --> 00:17:02,016
eyes were so fixed on the finish line
we do not even realize we are
trying to fill the pockets of biscuits

239
00:17:02,016 --> 00:17:04,630
Tell me Greg, you Differencies right from wrong?

240
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:06,118
I do not understand what you mean

241
00:17:06,118 --> 00:17:10,159
Say that there is a thing to you to do and
you hoping someone else would

242
00:17:10,159 --> 00:17:14,268
but eventually you realize that you would do yourself
even in defiance of all the rules

243
00:17:15,729 --> 00:17:18,121
Oh there it is I thought I was dreaming, this thing we have
do ... What?

244
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:22,536
We'll do this we will finally
from both, it's amazing

245
00:17:22,536 --> 00:17:24,676
I beg

246
00:17:30,724 --> 00:17:32,728
Oh you we
get rid of this thing

247
00:17:32,983 --> 00:17:35,119
Oh yes Shirley is too early, I
most can bear

248
00:17:35,219 --> 00:17:36,126
I understand you completely,

249
00:17:36,719 --> 00:17:41,078
since the installation of this panel
I find that there is much more black
before the store

250
00:17:41,778 --> 00:17:43,172
Pardon?

251
00:17:43,337 --> 00:17:47,614
They are not part of the customer and we
does not have enough staff to
follow all

252
00:17:47,974 --> 00:17:49,130
Thank you Lois

253
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:01,345
What are you doing?

254
00:18:01,557 --> 00:18:02,574
I put it back in its place

255
00:18:02,574 --> 00:18:03,309
Really?

256
00:18:03,827 --> 00:18:06,059
I am always ready to
recognize my wrongs

257
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,958
There are things that had me completely
escaped

258
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:11,250
probably because I was obsessed with the fact
you to obey me

259
00:18:11,592 --> 00:18:14,154
what matters is that I want him to stay here,

260
00:18:14,475 --> 00:18:15,901
must stay here!

261
00:18:21,354 --> 00:18:24,477
Talk about something, now I'm
to remove

262
00:18:24,477 --> 00:18:26,229
It's true look at that

263
00:18:26,229 --> 00:18:30,999
We live in what time it is called
Dopey is the great delusion

264
00:18:35,899 --> 00:18:38,879
But if I remove it believe that it is through
pure spirit of contradiction

265
00:18:39,472 --> 00:18:41,122
I am a spirit of contradiction?

266
00:18:42,032 --> 00:18:43,658
No, I find it completely shocking thing

267
00:18:43,758 --> 00:18:50,875
I really do and I did not know before
because I was damn upset, unless it
or otherwise ...

268
00:18:53,528 --> 00:18:58,474
I know, I'll think about how to get rid of in
leaving in its place and acting as if
nothing was

269
00:19:07,377 --> 00:19:08,274
Ok you can go

270
00:19:14,963 --> 00:19:16,767
Reese what are you waiting for go!

271
00:19:24,269 --> 00:19:26,633
Dad, I followed a possum who showed me
the way

272
00:19:26,633 --> 00:19:28,779
Dewey Not now, Dad handles
bins

273
00:19:32,988 --> 00:19:34,270
You're sure it's a good idea?

274
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:36,790
This is really not the kind of questions
ask now.

275
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,001
What are you playing Reese?

276
00:20:19,415 --> 00:20:22,804
What's the point of running? We live here!

277
00:20:23,902 --> 00:20:25,405
Whatever!

278
00:20:28,785 --> 00:20:30,734
If I leave, Mom what she wanted,

279
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:34,266
if I take it off, Mom has made me obey and
she has got what she wanted

280
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:36,416
I decided though is ...

281
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:40,118
a minute ... I am not required
deciding

282
00:20:40,118 --> 00:20:45,411
I can rely on luck, face
I take it off, I let battery in its place

283
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:47,522
I do not obey my mother ever

284
00:20:47,983 --> 00:20:50,688
From now on, I will not obey
to me alone

285
00:21:02,148 --> 00:21:03,859
I'm glad you like it

286
00:21:03,948 --> 00:21:05,675
This dish goes well with wine

287
00:21:06,412 --> 00:21:09,053
you will be able to take three containers
today?

288
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:11,108
Two course, both!

289
00:21:12,209 --> 00:21:12,999
