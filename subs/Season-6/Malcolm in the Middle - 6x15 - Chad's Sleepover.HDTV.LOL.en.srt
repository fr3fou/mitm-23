1
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:03,473
There's a head of rotten lettuce in the fridge.

2
00:00:03,897 --> 00:00:04,727
Not strong enough.

3
00:00:06,058 --> 00:00:08,296
Why don't you dig out whatever
it was that died under the furnace?

4
00:00:08,373 --> 00:00:09,395
Still not strong enough!

5
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:12,970
What about the old boot
that opossum gave birth in?

6
00:00:13,105 --> 00:00:14,127
It's out in the garage.

7
00:00:14,243 --> 00:00:14,880
Perfect!

8
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:21,106
All yours.

12
00:00:59,707 --> 00:01:00,806
I'm sorry I'm late.

13
00:01:00,864 --> 00:01:04,279
My alarm clock didn't go off and then there
was an accident and and road workers and...

14
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,276
Where is everybody?

15
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:09,823
Well, it's Ditch Day.
None of the students came in.

16
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,723
No one told me there was a ditch day.

17
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:15,342
Well, I'm surprised you didn't hear.
I mean, everyone was telling their friends.

18
00:01:18,027 --> 00:01:19,165
Oh...

19
00:01:20,884 --> 00:01:25,013
All right, Charisse, the professor of
boozology has some homework for you.

20
00:01:27,062 --> 00:01:27,872
What's he doing here?

21
00:01:28,181 --> 00:01:29,396
No one told him.

22
00:01:30,843 --> 00:01:32,117
Oh, my God.

23
00:01:33,679 --> 00:01:35,898
- You could probably use a little...
- Val, stop that.

24
00:01:37,932 --> 00:01:39,476
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

25
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:41,135
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

26
00:01:41,188 --> 00:01:41,497
What?

27
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:42,964
You are going to die!

28
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:43,446
What is it?

29
00:01:43,523 --> 00:01:47,449
I know I always say that gossip rots your soul,
but it doesn't count when it's this good.

30
00:01:47,864 --> 00:01:50,044
Last night, I covered for Bernice
so she could leave early,

31
00:01:50,092 --> 00:01:56,153
and when she got home, she found Charlie standing
in their living room wearing her red cocktail dress!

32
00:01:56,541 --> 00:01:59,184
The one from the Christmas
party with all the feathers!

33
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:00,515
Good God!

34
00:02:00,592 --> 00:02:02,309
He admitted it's been going on for years.

35
00:02:02,642 --> 00:02:06,250
He said it started one day when he accidentally
used lipstick instead of Chap Stick.

36
00:02:06,298 --> 00:02:09,153
The next thing you knew, he was
wearing a teddy under his police uniform.

37
00:02:09,783 --> 00:02:11,693
Man is a complicated beast.

38
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:15,330
Can you imagine keeping something
like that from your spouse?

39
00:02:17,311 --> 00:02:18,893
So glad we don't have any secrets.

40
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:17,001
What is it?

41
00:03:17,175 --> 00:03:20,088
Oh, honey, there's something
I should confess to you.

42
00:03:20,532 --> 00:03:21,111
What?!

43
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:22,751
I...

44
00:03:31,483 --> 00:03:37,464
I spent more than $50 on your last birthday present.
I know we agreed not to, but I just love you so much.

45
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:41,753
Well, I'm glad you told me.

46
00:03:42,475 --> 00:03:43,922
It felt good to come clean.

47
00:03:49,568 --> 00:03:51,497
Dad, can I have a sleepover tomorrow?

48
00:03:52,003 --> 00:03:53,990
Somebody wants to sleep over? Here?

49
00:03:54,076 --> 00:03:55,330
That's fantastic!

50
00:03:55,716 --> 00:03:56,193
Who?

51
00:03:56,251 --> 00:03:57,331
Chad from my class.

52
00:03:57,544 --> 00:04:00,534
Oh, geez, Dewey, I don't think
that's a good idea. That kid is really...

53
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:01,474
He's fine.

54
00:04:01,962 --> 00:04:03,417
He's just a little strange.

55
00:04:03,555 --> 00:04:04,842
Nothing to be scared of.

56
00:04:04,906 --> 00:04:07,059
Well, it's not anything to
be taken lightly, either.

57
00:04:07,074 --> 00:04:10,689
That boy has a lot of serious issues.
I don't think you know what you're getting into.

58
00:04:10,738 --> 00:04:11,785
Yes, I do.

59
00:04:12,071 --> 00:04:14,753
I also know people treat him
like a freak for no reason.

60
00:04:14,938 --> 00:04:16,925
Even his parents have given up on him.

61
00:04:17,062 --> 00:04:20,323
They're just looking for an excuse
to have him institutionalized.

62
00:04:20,535 --> 00:04:22,040
This is supposed to be convincing me?

63
00:04:22,101 --> 00:04:25,931
Dad, I want to prove that he can do normal
stuff like a normal kid and have a normal life.

64
00:04:25,948 --> 00:04:27,351
No means no, Dewey.

65
00:04:27,377 --> 00:04:28,665
No doesn't always mean no.

66
00:04:28,998 --> 00:04:32,053
This isn't "PG-movie" no,
this is "speargun" no.

67
00:04:33,191 --> 00:04:34,071
Dad, listen.

68
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:36,780
I never ask for anything,

69
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,472
but I'm asking you to do this for me.

70
00:04:39,102 --> 00:04:39,956
It's important.

71
00:04:41,424 --> 00:04:44,569
I'm sorry, Dewey, but I know a little
bit more about this than you do.

72
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,777
And you ask for things all the time.

73
00:04:50,016 --> 00:04:51,348
So where'd you go today?

74
00:04:51,492 --> 00:04:52,837
Oh, man, it was fantastic.

75
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:53,917
Went down o the pet store,

76
00:04:54,071 --> 00:04:56,305
fed a bunch of the pets to the other pets,

77
00:04:56,425 --> 00:05:00,592
ended up at the supermarket, where I squeezed all the
Wonder Bread into balls till the manager threw me out.

78
00:05:01,212 --> 00:05:02,828
I left a little present in his convertible.

79
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:05,529
Well, it was somebody's convertible.

80
00:05:05,696 --> 00:05:07,978
You couldn't have bothered
to tell me about Ditch Day?

81
00:05:08,594 --> 00:05:09,483
There was a ditch day?!

82
00:05:09,582 --> 00:05:10,530
Yeah, today.

83
00:05:12,101 --> 00:05:12,921
No one told me.

84
00:05:13,756 --> 00:05:14,793
Why didn't they tell me?

85
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:16,413
Because no one likes us, Reese.

86
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:17,154
No one.

87
00:05:17,476 --> 00:05:18,888
Everybody else was told about it.

88
00:05:19,007 --> 00:05:21,378
Even that slow kid who ate
cat litter for a dollar.

89
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,104
Ducky?

90
00:05:22,549 --> 00:05:23,813
How did Ducky get so popular?

91
00:05:23,892 --> 00:05:25,295
It's not that he's popular,

92
00:05:25,419 --> 00:05:26,832
it's that we're unpopular.

93
00:05:28,509 --> 00:05:29,527
Oh, my God.

94
00:05:31,292 --> 00:05:32,804
I'm as unpopular as you.

95
00:05:35,338 --> 00:05:37,718
Guess who's getting a treat?

96
00:05:37,735 --> 00:05:39,896
That's right, it's you, Mr. Boy.

97
00:05:40,088 --> 00:05:46,632
In this house, whenever anybody is good for three whole days
in a row, they get one of Mama's extra special fruit smoothies.

98
00:05:48,085 --> 00:05:49,607
I have never made one before.

99
00:05:56,338 --> 00:05:58,344
Oh, this is outrageous!

100
00:05:59,006 --> 00:05:59,717
What's the matter?

101
00:05:59,766 --> 00:06:02,601
The blender is broken. There's no excuse for this!

102
00:06:03,045 --> 00:06:05,765
Honey, we have had it since before Dewey was born.

103
00:06:05,968 --> 00:06:08,823
I don't care. They said a lifetime guarantee.

104
00:06:09,132 --> 00:06:12,021
A lifetime is not ten or eleven years.

105
00:06:12,022 --> 00:06:15,160
Hal, if they want to say a ten or
eleven-year guarantee, that's fine.

106
00:06:15,411 --> 00:06:18,775
I'll make my blender-buying decisions
accordingly, but they said "lifetime."

107
00:06:18,914 --> 00:06:21,620
I'm getting my money back or a
blender of equal or greater value.

108
00:06:21,675 --> 00:06:24,048
How are you going to find the
warranty from ten years ago?

109
00:06:24,241 --> 00:06:25,919
I'm sure it's with the rest
of the papers in the garage.

110
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:29,934
Honey, you'll never find it out there.
What did this cost, $19?

111
00:06:29,935 --> 00:06:32,013
That's what they want you to say!

112
00:06:32,054 --> 00:06:34,987
That's why they don't charge more!
That's how they get you!

113
00:06:36,841 --> 00:06:38,230
You expecting somebody?

114
00:06:38,259 --> 00:06:39,988
Uh, yeah, it's Chad. He's sleeping over tonight.

115
00:06:41,679 --> 00:06:42,865
Dewey's having a sleepover?

116
00:06:42,896 --> 00:06:44,565
Yeah, we didn't have any plans.
I thought it would be nice.

117
00:06:45,614 --> 00:06:47,402
Dewey, your friend's here!

118
00:06:49,702 --> 00:06:50,295
Hold on.

119
00:06:51,228 --> 00:06:56,718
I told you no, and you went behind my back and
tricked your mother into letting you have this sleepover?

120
00:06:56,962 --> 00:07:01,041
I just told her it'd be a nice thing to do for a
kid who doesn't have many nice things in his life.

121
00:07:01,777 --> 00:07:03,525
If you call that a trick, then yeah.

122
00:07:04,261 --> 00:07:06,867
You don't have to freak out.
I know how to handle Chad.

123
00:07:07,151 --> 00:07:09,666
You can't believe everything you
read in the special needs bulletin.

124
00:07:09,789 --> 00:07:11,628
They only say that stuff to get extra funding.

125
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,274
That is not the point!

126
00:07:13,337 --> 00:07:15,676
Dewey, I made myself very clear. I told you no,

127
00:07:15,775 --> 00:07:19,119
and you snuck around my back to you
mother as if nothing I said had any impact...

128
00:07:19,182 --> 00:07:20,297
Hello, there!

129
00:07:20,485 --> 00:07:21,867
You must be Chad's parents.

130
00:07:21,938 --> 00:07:23,817
- Yes. I'm Lloyd.
- Lloyd.

131
00:07:23,857 --> 00:07:25,455
- And this is Evelyn.
- Evelyn.

132
00:07:25,495 --> 00:07:25,897
And this...

133
00:07:27,142 --> 00:07:30,471
- God, where did he go?!
- I watched him from the car to the door.

134
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:31,806
Do I have to do everything?!

135
00:07:32,466 --> 00:07:33,879
Excuse me.

136
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,292
Thank you for inviting me.

137
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:35,870
Hi, Chad.

138
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:36,592
Hey, Dewey.

139
00:07:40,832 --> 00:07:42,512
We want to thank you for doing this.

140
00:07:42,622 --> 00:07:44,459
I think it's wonderful the boys are getting together.

141
00:07:44,546 --> 00:07:46,619
Big books go on the bottom shelf.

142
00:07:46,698 --> 00:07:48,974
What did we tell you about
touching their things?!

143
00:07:49,084 --> 00:07:51,471
Are you trying to prove that
you can't go out in public?!

144
00:07:51,537 --> 00:07:54,003
This is your last chance,
do you understand me, buddy?!

145
00:07:54,144 --> 00:07:56,829
- This is your last chance!
- Lloyd, do something!

146
00:07:56,955 --> 00:07:58,494
You do something! The gene was on your egg.

147
00:07:58,575 --> 00:08:02,014
Oh, yeah, it's completely my fault.
Now can we go to dinner?

148
00:08:03,474 --> 00:08:04,228
At bedtime,

149
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,364
these straps are for his arms,

150
00:08:06,633 --> 00:08:08,658
and these are for his legs.

151
00:08:08,737 --> 00:08:12,301
If you wind up needing to use the harness, make sure he doesn't
take a big breath in when you're fastening the buckles,

152
00:08:12,851 --> 00:08:15,253
otherwise, he can wriggle out
and the whole thing is useless.

153
00:08:15,404 --> 00:08:16,535
Completely useless.

154
00:08:16,802 --> 00:08:18,372
Say good-bye to your parents, Chad.

155
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,424
Good-bye.

156
00:08:20,005 --> 00:08:21,811
Here's a list of emergency numbers.

157
00:08:22,078 --> 00:08:23,679
Don't try 911.

158
00:08:23,735 --> 00:08:25,179
They're not qualified.

159
00:08:32,723 --> 00:08:34,199
Maybe they meant to tell us.

160
00:08:34,434 --> 00:08:35,345
They just forgot.

161
00:08:36,177 --> 00:08:37,119
They didn't forget.

162
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:39,836
How could the whole school snub us like this?

163
00:08:40,508 --> 00:08:42,267
Don't they realize how much this hurts?

164
00:08:42,596 --> 00:08:43,413
They don't care.

165
00:08:44,308 --> 00:08:46,475
There are people in this world
that are just plain evil.

166
00:08:46,947 --> 00:08:49,616
And every single person at that
school is one of those people.

167
00:08:50,008 --> 00:08:50,637
No,

168
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:52,207
we can't do this.

169
00:08:52,521 --> 00:08:55,300
We can't keep blaming everybody else
whenever something like this happens.

170
00:08:55,734 --> 00:08:58,435
It can't be an accident that you
and I alienate so many people.

171
00:08:58,733 --> 00:09:02,486
We're never going to make our lives better
if we keep pretending they are the problem.

172
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:06,864
Then what do we do?

173
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:08,591
Well,

174
00:09:09,188 --> 00:09:10,947
I mean, if we really want to figure this out,

175
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:13,986
maybe we need to look at ourselves honestly.

176
00:09:15,697 --> 00:09:16,247
You're right.

177
00:09:17,582 --> 00:09:18,744
What's wrong with us?

178
00:09:19,073 --> 00:09:20,094
Well, some parts are easy.

179
00:09:20,557 --> 00:09:23,289
- I mean, you're a ruthlessly brutal thug.
- I have my moods.

180
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:26,697
And look how it was my first
impulse to criticize you.

181
00:09:27,152 --> 00:09:28,848
It just shows what a pompous ass I am.

182
00:09:29,044 --> 00:09:30,897
I do seem to cause a lot of needless suffering.

183
00:09:31,384 --> 00:09:33,158
I usually assume that people are my enemy.

184
00:09:33,378 --> 00:09:34,571
I have this need to show off.

185
00:09:35,105 --> 00:09:37,068
It's not enough that I know more than everyone.

186
00:09:37,145 --> 00:09:39,045
I have to make sure they know I know more.

187
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:40,395
Why do I do that?

188
00:09:40,521 --> 00:09:42,342
Don't ask me. I know less than everyone.

189
00:09:42,421 --> 00:09:46,174
When I walk into a room, it seems like everybody's
talking about things that I could never understand.

190
00:09:46,903 --> 00:09:49,682
And when they laugh, I'm always
sure that they're laughing at me.

191
00:09:51,331 --> 00:09:52,776
Maybe we're both afraid.

192
00:09:54,006 --> 00:09:55,607
We're afraid people won't like us.

193
00:09:56,298 --> 00:09:58,858
That's why I show off how smart
I am and that's why you hit people.

194
00:10:01,025 --> 00:10:02,406
We're scared of being rejected,

195
00:10:02,693 --> 00:10:04,562
so we act in a way that pushes people away.

196
00:10:05,043 --> 00:10:05,940
Oh, man.

197
00:10:06,044 --> 00:10:09,571
It's the thing that we hate the most, and
yet we keep making it happen again and again.

198
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:11,628
We're so stupid and pathetic.

199
00:10:15,338 --> 00:10:16,531
Or they're jealous!

200
00:10:17,756 --> 00:10:19,342
Yeah, totally jealous.

201
00:10:19,483 --> 00:10:22,183
I mean, they see us, and they don't
want to face that they're all jealous,

202
00:10:22,356 --> 00:10:24,727
so they make us act all angry and superior!

203
00:10:24,978 --> 00:10:25,732
They're in denial.

204
00:10:26,658 --> 00:10:28,323
I am really glad we did this.

205
00:10:38,907 --> 00:10:40,865
Rough can't go next to smooth.

206
00:10:42,115 --> 00:10:44,322
This is exactly what I talked about, Dewey.

207
00:10:44,372 --> 00:10:46,495
He's gone through practically
everything in the house.

208
00:10:46,661 --> 00:10:48,652
He taped my ties to my shirts.

209
00:10:48,735 --> 00:10:49,896
So the house gets straightened up.

210
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:53,840
- Wouldn't that be horrible?
- Don't you trivialize this.
You're in enough trouble already.

211
00:10:53,906 --> 00:10:58,120
I'm telling you, once he settles down,
this is going to be a perfectly normal sleepover.

212
00:10:58,343 --> 00:11:04,382
- We're going to play a board game, we're going
to watch a video, we're going to have pizza...
- No pizza. I'm already defrosting hamburgers.

213
00:11:04,431 --> 00:11:07,418
But I promised Chad pizza. He really likes pizza.

214
00:11:07,494 --> 00:11:11,061
No pizza, Dewey. You are on thin ice as it is.

215
00:11:11,226 --> 00:11:14,561
From now on, you are going to do
exactly as I say. Is that understood?

216
00:11:14,933 --> 00:11:17,654
Yes, Dad, I got it.
Now can I go play with my friend?

217
00:11:20,424 --> 00:11:21,171
Where'd he go?

218
00:11:22,936 --> 00:11:28,095
You'll see a lot of this in life, Jamie. The big blender
company's don't think we're smart enough to save warranties.

219
00:11:28,217 --> 00:11:33,559
They think we run around barefoot all day picking bugs
off ourselves. Well, they are in for a big surprise.

220
00:11:35,879 --> 00:11:39,546
They design their products specifically to break
down three days after the warranties get lost.

221
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:41,470
It's called "planned obsolescence,"

222
00:11:41,786 --> 00:11:44,689
like that deathtrap of a highchair
you keep falling over in.

223
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:49,977
I'm their worst nightmare, Jamie;
a woman who saves everything.

224
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:52,515
And I'm going to go through every shred of it.

225
00:11:55,895 --> 00:11:58,516
<i>What's that, Mr. Big-Blender-Company man?</i>

226
00:11:58,931 --> 00:12:00,507
You say I'm going to need paperwork?

227
00:12:00,729 --> 00:12:01,459
Oh, gee,

228
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:04,927
I don't know if I have it. Oh, wait, I do.

229
00:12:15,891 --> 00:12:18,380
Dewey, I told you to keep Chad away from my desk.

230
00:12:20,337 --> 00:12:25,477
I just heard a whole bunch of kids from our school are going
to stay overnight at that old abandoned house on Spires Road.

231
00:12:25,737 --> 00:12:26,848
No one told me.

232
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:28,409
Big shock.

233
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:31,279
I say we go there tonight and
scare the crap out of them.

234
00:12:31,827 --> 00:12:36,140
- We're going to scare them for being jealous of us?
- No, we're going to scare them for being jerks.

235
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,057
All right, yeah. Let's do it.

236
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,750
They think they can be jerks to us?

237
00:12:41,882 --> 00:12:43,293
We'll show them what jerks are.

238
00:13:10,751 --> 00:13:13,206
- Hi. I got a half cheese, half pepperoni.
- What?

239
00:13:14,533 --> 00:13:17,155
- That little...
- Listen, I'm kind of in a hurry. It's $12.

240
00:13:17,228 --> 00:13:18,605
- Just hold on a second.
- Dewey!

241
00:13:18,738 --> 00:13:20,795
You get your butt in here right now, Mister!

242
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:25,689
Dad, what is wrong with you? You can't go
screaming in the house when Chad's here.

243
00:13:25,757 --> 00:13:28,876
I am the parent in this house, and you do what I say!

244
00:13:28,976 --> 00:13:31,199
Now when I tell you there is no pizza in this house,

245
00:13:31,366 --> 00:13:33,357
there's no pizza! That is the law!

246
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,024
Dad... Don't you "Dad" me. You already
"Dad-ed" me good with this sleepover.

247
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:37,720
You know what?

248
00:13:38,158 --> 00:13:42,173
Sometimes if you're just being bigoted and
unreasonable, maybe I don't have to listen to you.

249
00:13:42,438 --> 00:13:43,915
You better listen to me.

250
00:13:44,103 --> 00:13:49,346
- I am your father and you will respect...
- Hey, you know what? This was supposed to go to 12336.

251
00:13:51,838 --> 00:13:53,696
I bet you feel like a jackass.

252
00:14:03,029 --> 00:14:04,158
I have something to tell you.

253
00:14:04,216 --> 00:14:05,529
Hal, it will have to wait.

254
00:14:05,936 --> 00:14:08,251
I wasted a half an hour getting Jamie to sleep.

255
00:14:08,463 --> 00:14:11,569
He kept crying because I wouldn't let him
have the antifreeze bottle in bed with him.

256
00:14:11,618 --> 00:14:13,169
Lois, this is important.

257
00:14:13,649 --> 00:14:16,652
I was trying to spare you the embarrassment,
but you should probably know.

258
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:22,343
Dewey actually asked me first about the sleepover.
And he went to you when I said no.

259
00:14:23,044 --> 00:14:24,047
Oh, sorry.

260
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:25,992
What do you mean, "sorry"?

261
00:14:26,648 --> 00:14:30,082
Maybe you don't understand.
He went around my back to get to you.

262
00:14:30,295 --> 00:14:32,167
And this is a big upset for you?

263
00:14:32,247 --> 00:14:35,064
For God's sake, Hal, they go behind
my back to get to you all the time.

264
00:14:35,086 --> 00:14:37,729
That is very different. You are the hard ass.

265
00:14:37,825 --> 00:14:40,854
I'm the nice, fair one. Dewey knows that.

266
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:42,445
Why would he betray me?

267
00:14:42,455 --> 00:14:45,177
Hal, I cannot get worked up about this right now.

268
00:14:45,686 --> 00:14:48,387
I have to find that warranty
or the blender company wins.

269
00:14:48,546 --> 00:14:49,811
Is that what you want, Hal?

270
00:14:49,842 --> 00:14:50,953
Are you on their side?

271
00:14:50,994 --> 00:14:52,665
Fine. I'll help you.

272
00:14:57,827 --> 00:14:59,988
No, Hal. I have a system.

273
00:15:00,681 --> 00:15:02,398
Anyway, it seems to be going fine.

274
00:15:02,504 --> 00:15:04,279
I haven't heard a peep out of them in hours.

275
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:09,774
Hey, Chad, I can teach you to play
Chinese checkers if you want.

276
00:15:11,627 --> 00:15:12,591
Chad!

277
00:15:12,671 --> 00:15:13,771
White on white...

278
00:15:15,222 --> 00:15:16,515
Blue on blue...

279
00:15:17,872 --> 00:15:19,080
And yellow on yellow.

280
00:15:19,082 --> 00:15:20,110
Chad, don't do this.

281
00:15:20,302 --> 00:15:22,358
If someone catches you you'll be in big trouble...

282
00:15:27,709 --> 00:15:28,157
<i>Dewey.</i>

283
00:15:28,576 --> 00:15:29,384
Just a minute.

284
00:15:39,569 --> 00:15:40,088
Hello.

285
00:15:40,772 --> 00:15:41,730
Oh, hello, Lloyd.

286
00:15:42,856 --> 00:15:44,468
No, everything's going fine with Chad.

287
00:15:46,044 --> 00:15:47,659
Well, you can bring it if you think he needs it.

288
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,702
We are going to scare the crap out of them.

289
00:15:52,751 --> 00:15:53,378
You know what?

290
00:15:53,705 --> 00:15:55,905
I don't feel sorry for them. They've got it coming.

291
00:15:55,927 --> 00:15:58,551
They deserve every stained pair of
underwear they're about to get.

292
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:01,259
Hey, is my eye socket oozing enough?

293
00:16:01,338 --> 00:16:02,175
It's perfect.

294
00:16:02,697 --> 00:16:08,697
Okay, on the count of three we bust through the door. If one of them
has a heart attack, you resuscitate them and I'll scare them again.

295
00:16:09,681 --> 00:16:10,221
Ready?

296
00:16:10,858 --> 00:16:14,099
One... two... three.

297
00:16:22,757 --> 00:16:24,262
What are you guys doing?

298
00:16:25,878 --> 00:16:26,650
- Um...
- Um...

299
00:16:27,894 --> 00:16:28,984
- Uh...
- Um...

300
00:16:29,611 --> 00:16:30,594
Nothing.

301
00:16:31,146 --> 00:16:32,632
You guys trying to scare us?

302
00:16:32,786 --> 00:16:34,040
What, are you 12?

303
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:36,915
We weren't trying to scare you.

304
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:38,014
Of course not.

305
00:16:38,305 --> 00:16:39,945
That's the opposite of what we were trying to do.

306
00:16:41,144 --> 00:16:42,263
We're meeting girls here.

307
00:16:43,981 --> 00:16:45,428
Then why are you dressed like that?

308
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:48,023
Because...

309
00:16:50,357 --> 00:16:50,820
Um...

310
00:16:56,993 --> 00:16:57,475
Uh...

311
00:17:01,124 --> 00:17:02,745
Why don't you like us?!

312
00:17:05,025 --> 00:17:07,128
I got to say, they had some pretty solid reasons.

313
00:17:09,259 --> 00:17:10,494
Come on, Chad.

314
00:17:10,508 --> 00:17:12,631
You have to find some way to snap out of this.

315
00:17:14,097 --> 00:17:15,389
Look, I went to bat for you.

316
00:17:15,442 --> 00:17:18,786
I've been protecting you all day,
but this is something I can't cover up.

317
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:22,201
And if your parents find out,
they're going to put you away.

318
00:17:23,324 --> 00:17:24,443
Are you listening?

319
00:17:25,236 --> 00:17:26,007
Yes.

320
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:32,515
Green goes with green, goes with green, goes with green,
goes with green, goes with green, goes with green...

321
00:17:33,684 --> 00:17:34,899
Hello, Hal.

322
00:17:34,927 --> 00:17:36,211
Evelyn, Lloyd, come on in.

323
00:17:36,919 --> 00:17:44,423
So, we were halfway through our first dinner alone in a decade, when
someone had to remind me that I didn't give Chad his good night pill.

324
00:17:44,792 --> 00:17:45,178
Oh.

325
00:17:45,623 --> 00:17:48,035
Okay, well, I'll just, uh, go get him.

326
00:17:54,963 --> 00:17:58,069
This in no way justifies what you said before.

327
00:18:04,659 --> 00:18:08,151
Chad, I want to show you a little
project I've been working on.

328
00:18:11,974 --> 00:18:12,746
Look at this.

329
00:18:13,721 --> 00:18:17,666
You see where I took my pen and I filled
in the letters that needed to be filled in.

330
00:18:18,216 --> 00:18:20,512
The "O's," the "A's," the "E's," the "G's."

331
00:18:21,727 --> 00:18:24,184
The "Q's," the "P's," the "D's" and the "B's"?

332
00:18:24,187 --> 00:18:24,653
Of course.

333
00:18:24,718 --> 00:18:25,472
That was you?

334
00:18:26,223 --> 00:18:27,844
- What about the nines?
- Yes.

335
00:18:28,268 --> 00:18:30,217
What about the circles and the percent signs?

336
00:18:30,225 --> 00:18:34,109
Absolutely. Otherwise you'll be left with
that horrible feeling of uncompleteness.

337
00:18:47,309 --> 00:18:48,638
Here they are,

338
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,979
sleepover buddies.

339
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:51,085
Has he been okay?

340
00:18:51,101 --> 00:18:52,334
Oh, he's been fine.

341
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:55,368
And I think people prejudge Chad sometimes.

342
00:18:55,447 --> 00:18:56,190
He's a good kid.

343
00:18:58,063 --> 00:18:58,766
Open.

344
00:19:03,546 --> 00:19:04,846
I'm sorry, Dad.

345
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:07,473
I thought you were just being...

346
00:19:09,363 --> 00:19:10,772
I mean, I had no idea you were...

347
00:19:13,808 --> 00:19:15,371
So how crazy are you?

348
00:19:16,374 --> 00:19:19,577
Let's just say that's my third set of encyclopedias.

349
00:19:35,201 --> 00:19:37,593
If we leave right now, we can still catch the movie.

350
00:19:38,558 --> 00:19:39,484
What's this?

351
00:19:41,837 --> 00:19:42,821
The warranty?

352
00:19:43,422 --> 00:19:45,563
Hey, good for you, Chad.

353
00:19:46,759 --> 00:19:49,421
Well, I give up. I'm throwing out that blender.

354
00:19:49,556 --> 00:19:51,138
You don't have to. Look what Chad did.

355
00:19:51,374 --> 00:19:54,481
Pictures of things belong on
the things they're pictures of.

356
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:58,187
Check... and mate.

357
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:04,669
Dewey, what is it?

358
00:20:05,556 --> 00:20:06,231
Hal?

359
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:13,351
Honey... I'm sorry.

360
00:20:13,838 --> 00:20:16,905
You were lying there asleep and
you just looked so beautiful.

361
00:20:17,226 --> 00:20:20,988
And the moment was perfect and I never wanted it to end.
And then I saw the camera, and...

362
00:20:21,306 --> 00:20:23,544
And... I'm weak, Lois.

363
00:20:23,845 --> 00:20:25,177
I'm a little man.

364
00:20:26,025 --> 00:20:28,553
I know that I can never apologize enough and...

365
00:20:29,994 --> 00:20:32,502
I'm sure right now you don't
even want to look at me.

366
00:20:35,971 --> 00:20:36,531
Hal.

367
00:20:42,812 --> 00:20:44,289
Everyone's going to hear about this.

368
00:20:45,156 --> 00:20:46,042
We suck.

369
00:20:46,697 --> 00:20:47,860
We totally suck.

370
00:20:48,027 --> 00:20:49,522
I hate myself so much.

371
00:20:49,744 --> 00:20:51,055
What is wrong with us?

372
00:20:51,461 --> 00:20:54,867
Everyone else our age heard it "empty
house," and we heard "haunted house."

373
00:20:55,303 --> 00:20:59,180
Are we just socially stunted in
some way that makes us hopeless?

374
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,034
I think half of them were really scared.

375
00:21:07,369 --> 00:21:08,237
Yeah.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
