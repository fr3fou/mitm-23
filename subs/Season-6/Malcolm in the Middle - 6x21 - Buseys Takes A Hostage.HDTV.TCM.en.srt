1
00:00:00,923 --> 00:00:03,644
So, if Rex Huntington is the
finest doctor in Spring Valley,

2
00:00:03,947 --> 00:00:05,626
why is he defending
Jessica in the murder trial.

3
00:00:05,758 --> 00:00:09,096
Because, before he got pushed off
that mountain and got amnesia,

4
00:00:09,098 --> 00:00:11,441
he was the finest
lawyer in Spring Valley.

5
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,424
What I can't believe is Jessica is
having an affair with the judge.

6
00:00:14,535 --> 00:00:17,607
I mean, he's totally using her to get
his hands on the Farnsworth fortune.

7
00:00:19,319 --> 00:00:20,190
You can't ground me!

8
00:00:20,248 --> 00:00:21,888
That fire could have
been started by anybody!

9
00:00:22,336 --> 00:00:25,388
Why don't you ever take my side?!
You never listen anything I say!

10
00:00:29,038 --> 00:00:33,107
You know, Reese, some very manly men
watch soap operas with their mothers.

<i>If you are diligent in your efforts,

will develop your fine motor skills

Also, it will teach you a vocation

17
00:01:29,476 --> 00:01:30,437
Hello, class.

18
00:01:30,473 --> 00:01:31,935
Hello, Principal Jeffers.

19
00:01:31,947 --> 00:01:33,841
You've come at
a very exciting time.

20
00:01:33,891 --> 00:01:36,403
We're about to open
a new box of key clips.

21
00:01:36,453 --> 00:01:38,290
And how are we all today, students?

22
00:01:38,533 --> 00:01:41,267
I know no one gives a crap
about the kids in this class,

23
00:01:41,605 --> 00:01:44,507
but could you get us some books
so we could actually learn something?

24
00:01:44,744 --> 00:01:48,584
The only thing we've done here for
the last ten weeks is make lanyards!

25
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:52,654
You know what subject I hated
most when I was a kid? Math.

26
00:01:54,777 --> 00:01:57,147
Dewey, I need you to
re-sort my pills again.

27
00:01:57,473 --> 00:02:00,074
I just finished sorting them.
It took me a half hour.

28
00:02:00,094 --> 00:02:04,010
I know. But then I unsorted them so
I could see if I could sort them by myself.

29
00:02:04,542 --> 00:02:05,208
I can't.

30
00:02:06,058 --> 00:02:08,457
All right. Just don't
touch them anymore.

31
00:02:08,834 --> 00:02:10,165
I'll do it with you after school.

32
00:02:10,376 --> 00:02:12,191
Dewey, I need your help after school.

33
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:13,459
I'm already helping Hanson.

34
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,382
But I need you!

35
00:02:14,787 --> 00:02:16,880
The sidewalks told me they wouldn't
let me walk home anymore.

36
00:02:16,912 --> 00:02:17,487
Can you...?

37
00:02:20,092 --> 00:02:22,714
Okay, just wait till I'm done,
then I'll walk you home.

38
00:02:23,224 --> 00:02:26,781
But, seriously, you guys have to start
trying to do a little more for yourselves.

39
00:02:27,635 --> 00:02:29,905
Oh, that reminds me.
My uncle died,

40
00:02:29,955 --> 00:02:32,776
and my parents were wondering
if you'd explain death to me.

41
00:02:39,574 --> 00:02:40,900
Are you studying?

42
00:02:41,022 --> 00:02:45,222
Yeah. My stupid teachers wait
until the end of my senior year
to tell me I have final exams.

43
00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:46,750
In every single class!

44
00:02:47,115 --> 00:02:48,436
I've got to get serious now.

45
00:02:48,556 --> 00:02:51,541
If the finals are anything like this
practice test, it's gonna be brutal.

46
00:02:51,795 --> 00:02:54,006
It's just a bunch of
true/false questions.

47
00:02:54,073 --> 00:02:55,813
So it's a 50-50 chance.

48
00:02:56,138 --> 00:02:57,930
Do you know what the odds are
of getting one of those right?

49
00:02:59,561 --> 00:03:02,128
$23 for the neighborhood association.

50
00:03:02,428 --> 00:03:03,785
The annual meeting
is tomorrow night.

51
00:03:03,843 --> 00:03:06,521
It's been a year already?
Those people are relentless.

52
00:03:06,877 --> 00:03:08,867
You think, if we showed up once,
they'd stop inviting us?

53
00:03:08,991 --> 00:03:11,715
-That's always been the pattern.
-Hal, don't worry. You have a good excuse.

54
00:03:12,111 --> 00:03:14,440
Tomorrow you're cleaning the
dead possum out of the chimney.

55
00:03:14,534 --> 00:03:18,517
The smell has gotten so bad, I can't tell
when Jamie needs changing anymore.

56
00:03:18,605 --> 00:03:21,165
You know, if we just wait a few more
weeks, it'll disintegrate on its own.

57
00:03:21,177 --> 00:03:22,344
Tomorrow, Hal.

58
00:03:22,395 --> 00:03:24,305
I'm sick of all those crows on roof.

59
00:03:26,089 --> 00:03:26,559
Hey, Dad.

60
00:03:27,347 --> 00:03:30,216
What? Wait.
You think patriotism is a joke?!

61
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:34,542
Representative government is an
outdated sham? I can't believe my ears!

62
00:03:34,802 --> 00:03:35,728
What are you talking about?

63
00:03:35,778 --> 00:03:36,807
What did he say?

64
00:03:36,827 --> 00:03:40,159
I can't even repeat it. I'm sorry, Lois,
but the chimney will just have to wait.

65
00:03:40,217 --> 00:03:42,778
I'm taking Malcolm to the
neighborhood association meeting.

66
00:03:43,192 --> 00:03:47,159
Let's hope seeing democracy in action
will give our little cynic a wake-up call.

67
00:03:52,129 --> 00:03:54,777
Chad, I have to finish correcting
everyone's homework.

68
00:03:54,827 --> 00:03:58,164
It's been in your mouth a half an
hour. Either spit it out or swallow it.

69
00:03:58,297 --> 00:03:58,697
Dewey?

70
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:00,300
Oh, hey, Francis.

71
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:01,583
You want to talk to Mom?

72
00:04:01,624 --> 00:04:03,004
No. I called to talk to you.

73
00:04:03,604 --> 00:04:05,187
Me? Really?

74
00:04:05,393 --> 00:04:08,707
Yeah. Listen. I'm up for a job as
activities director at a summer camp,

75
00:04:09,095 --> 00:04:11,245
but I have to show them what kind
of program I can put together.

76
00:04:11,428 --> 00:04:12,659
I need you to help me.

77
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:14,958
-You want my help?
-<i>Yeah.</i>

78
00:04:15,052 --> 00:04:18,667
I have all these great ideas for games,
so I'm gonna come home tomorrow
so I can play them with you.

79
00:04:19,243 --> 00:04:20,611
You know, to make sure
they're fun enough.

80
00:04:20,933 --> 00:04:21,979
<i>So how does that sound?</i>

81
00:04:22,232 --> 00:04:25,509
Like a setup for a cruel practical joke,
but I'm willing to take the risk.

82
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:31,804
Excuse me.

83
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:33,616
We're here for the
homeowners meeting.

84
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:35,699
Oh, my God! Really?

85
00:04:37,509 --> 00:04:40,949
Oh, that's fantastic!

86
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:41,829
Jim Phipps.

87
00:04:42,257 --> 00:04:44,074
I'm the association's attorney.

88
00:04:44,122 --> 00:04:45,643
So... where is everyone?

89
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:48,028
Well, I kind of am everyone.

90
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,799
No one's ever shown up for
a homeowners meeting in 20 years.

91
00:04:52,086 --> 00:04:53,764
You're kidding. Not one person?

92
00:04:53,782 --> 00:04:54,949
Not one... not one...

93
00:04:55,305 --> 00:05:02,122
I send out 150 flyers every
year, exactly as mandated by the
developer, but nobody ever comes.

94
00:05:02,443 --> 00:05:06,152
I've tried different fonts,
I've upgraded the doughnuts,

95
00:05:06,202 --> 00:05:08,367
but people just don't
seem to be interested.

96
00:05:08,431 --> 00:05:11,225
So, every year, you rent a room,
and hold a meeting for nobody?

97
00:05:11,234 --> 00:05:12,249
Absolutely.

98
00:05:12,526 --> 00:05:15,918
My contract with the
developer is very clear.

99
00:05:16,036 --> 00:05:20,567
In exchange for a $2,000 annual retainer,
I'm to conduct annual meetings,

100
00:05:20,675 --> 00:05:25,093
take the minutes, and manage
the association's financial interests.

101
00:05:25,129 --> 00:05:25,939
Financial interest?

102
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:30,575
Well, actually, there aren't any. I didn't
mean to come off so self-important.

103
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:36,762
Only the homeowners can decide
where the money goes, so I've just been
putting the dues in a savings account.

104
00:05:37,138 --> 00:05:41,477
The bank gave me a toaster in 1987.
I never even opened the box.

105
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:49,462
So, 150 homes paying 23 bucks over 20 years,
passbook interest, minus the retainer...

106
00:05:50,186 --> 00:05:54,449
Oh, my God! If my math is right,
he's sitting on at least $83,000!

107
00:05:55,465 --> 00:05:57,263
Who am I kidding?
Of course my math is right.

108
00:05:57,553 --> 00:06:03,051
You know, it sure would be nice to have
someone finally take charge of this thing.

109
00:06:03,142 --> 00:06:07,037
Would you ever consider being president
of the neighborhood association?

110
00:06:08,053 --> 00:06:10,496
I don't think so.
It sounds like... work.

111
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:11,740
Dad, what are you talking about?

112
00:06:11,856 --> 00:06:13,234
Of course you want to be president!

113
00:06:13,271 --> 00:06:15,408
This is your chance to really do
something for the community.

114
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,541
-I don't think...
-You can't turn this down.

115
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:21,687
You've always told me that
a real citizen is willing to make
sacrifices for the greater good.

116
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:25,106
-This doesn't sound like...
-And I took those words to heart!

117
00:06:25,338 --> 00:06:26,588
They inspired me.

118
00:06:26,774 --> 00:06:30,214
And now I have a chance to see my own
dad show me what democracy is all about.

119
00:06:30,351 --> 00:06:31,483
You can't deny me that.

120
00:06:31,741 --> 00:06:32,892
-Well...
-It's not just for me.

121
00:06:33,378 --> 00:06:37,187
It's for our family, our block,
the whole neighborhood!

122
00:06:37,477 --> 00:06:39,015
Think of all the people you could help.

123
00:06:39,471 --> 00:06:42,383
The world is waiting for you
to make it a better place!

124
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:45,569
Well... Okay. I'll do it.

125
00:06:46,762 --> 00:06:47,700
Finally!

126
00:06:48,565 --> 00:06:51,653
This is exactly the reason
I went into zoning law.

127
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:13,309
I don't see how this helps.

128
00:07:14,925 --> 00:07:15,751
Where's Dewey?

129
00:07:16,013 --> 00:07:17,948
When I was his age,
I was out of school hours ago.

130
00:07:19,441 --> 00:07:20,785
Doing independent study...

131
00:07:20,961 --> 00:07:21,782
at the library...

132
00:07:22,089 --> 00:07:22,949
not smoking.

133
00:07:23,727 --> 00:07:25,103
So, it's exciting about the job.

134
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,756
Yeah. It's been a long hunt,
but it finally paid off.

135
00:07:29,642 --> 00:07:31,981
Don't you have to have some kind of degree
or something to work with children?

136
00:07:32,005 --> 00:07:34,304
You never think anything
I ever do is good enough!

137
00:07:34,354 --> 00:07:36,368
I happened to do very
well at that interview.

138
00:07:36,418 --> 00:07:40,039
All I have to do now is just show
them that I can put together a
good program for the summer.

139
00:07:40,579 --> 00:07:41,889
So you don't have the job.

140
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:44,917
I have the job! What don't
you understand about that?!

141
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:47,260
<i>I don't know. It just sounds like
the real estate thing all over again.</i>

142
00:07:47,293 --> 00:07:49,606
Why can't you just have
faith in me for once?!

143
00:07:50,599 --> 00:07:52,641
Gin. Want to play again?

144
00:07:52,741 --> 00:07:53,157
Sure.

145
00:07:54,103 --> 00:07:56,195
-You know who's hiring?
-<i>I have a job!</i>

146
00:07:57,853 --> 00:07:59,429
I am appalled.

147
00:07:59,787 --> 00:08:01,941
This completion stitch is kinked.

148
00:08:02,508 --> 00:08:08,525
Young lady, if you neglect your education,
you deny yourself the keys to success.

149
00:08:11,495 --> 00:08:12,249
Dewey, wait!

150
00:08:12,573 --> 00:08:14,743
I can't. I have to get
home to see my brother.

151
00:08:14,983 --> 00:08:17,765
But I need you to help me with
the algebra problems you gave me.

152
00:08:17,826 --> 00:08:20,355
I went over those problems 20 times!

153
00:08:20,453 --> 00:08:23,337
But my head passhrough a magnet,
and I think I forgot everything.

154
00:08:31,296 --> 00:08:32,816
I'm sorry! I can't!

155
00:08:34,678 --> 00:08:36,211
I can't do this anymore.

156
00:08:38,737 --> 00:08:39,390
I'm sorry.

157
00:08:40,261 --> 00:08:42,450
It's okay, Dewey. We understand.

158
00:08:43,493 --> 00:08:43,982
Yeah.

159
00:08:44,389 --> 00:08:46,911
Go have fun with your
brother. We'll be fine.

160
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,949
Everyone turn in their assignments.

161
00:08:55,556 --> 00:08:58,892
I have to take this one home with me.
It doesn't believe that I have a cat.

162
00:08:59,029 --> 00:09:03,331
It's 3:00. It is now time
to clear your area!

163
00:09:04,906 --> 00:09:07,402
I don't think you want to do
anything physical with Chad.

164
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:08,532
Don't test me, young man.

165
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:11,552
I am an educator who is not
afraid to use discipline.

166
00:09:16,131 --> 00:09:16,958
All right.

167
00:09:17,615 --> 00:09:19,618
Now it's a matter for the police.

168
00:09:20,656 --> 00:09:21,735
Dewey! What do we do?

169
00:09:21,745 --> 00:09:22,661
He's not here.

170
00:09:22,787 --> 00:09:23,929
Somebody do something!

171
00:09:30,676 --> 00:09:32,800
Excuse me, Mr. Flerch?

172
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:40,819
Well I think of the
three ideas we had,

173
00:09:41,177 --> 00:09:42,409
this was the best.

174
00:09:46,888 --> 00:09:47,682
I win!

175
00:09:47,774 --> 00:09:48,507
<i>Good job.</i>

176
00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:53,814
Okay, Dewey, of all the things we did today,
what seemed like it could be more fun?

177
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:59,089
The rainbow acle course or the tickle maze
or the shower of lollipops?

178
00:09:59,204 --> 00:10:01,099
I have to tell it was all fantastic.

179
00:10:01,319 --> 00:10:03,307
It was by far the best day of my life.

180
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:05,877
I can make you happier.

181
00:10:08,553 --> 00:10:13,078
"President, comma, Newcastle
Adjacent Neighborhood Association."

182
00:10:13,122 --> 00:10:14,839
Hal, that is so fancy.

183
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:16,675
Feel the little duck. That's embossed.

184
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:20,083
So. How's my little bureaucrat?

185
00:10:20,275 --> 00:10:20,979
Fantastic.

186
00:10:21,268 --> 00:10:24,715
I'm just finishing up the details
in all the neighborhood initiatives
you've been talking about.

187
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:25,866
I was?

188
00:10:26,005 --> 00:10:29,074
Yeah. Remember you said,
"I hope I do a good job"?

189
00:10:29,367 --> 00:10:31,283
Obviously that mean
structural improvements:

190
00:10:31,408 --> 00:10:34,555
like installing lights at the basketball
court and building a skate park...

191
00:10:34,752 --> 00:10:36,980
and Friday night dance
parties with a killer DJ.

192
00:10:37,434 --> 00:10:38,536
Isn't that kind expensive?

193
00:10:38,543 --> 00:10:40,384
You have to think
of it as an investment.

194
00:10:40,757 --> 00:10:42,523
It's actually expensive not to do it.

195
00:10:42,941 --> 00:10:45,380
There's $87,000 in the account?

196
00:10:46,244 --> 00:10:48,898
Well, a lot of it gets eaten up
servicing the infrastructure.

197
00:10:48,992 --> 00:10:52,209
Like, there's no point in having
a DJ if you're not going to have
a really rock sound system.

198
00:10:52,596 --> 00:10:54,507
Why are we just give the
homeowners a refund check?

199
00:10:55,045 --> 00:10:55,811
We could.

200
00:10:56,147 --> 00:10:59,469
But we wouldn't have the money
for what you said was the most
important thing... security.

201
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,114
Security is big.

202
00:11:01,299 --> 00:11:05,102
I've been racking my brain, trying find
a way to give every area equal protection.

203
00:11:05,422 --> 00:11:10,632
I wish there was some magic kind of
mobile security system that could
weave through the neighborhood.

204
00:11:11,312 --> 00:11:12,591
Like a security car?

205
00:11:12,661 --> 00:11:13,805
Dad that's brilliant!

206
00:11:14,259 --> 00:11:17,689
And then citizens from the
neighborhood could drive a car
out to make sure there's no trouble.

207
00:11:17,754 --> 00:11:18,403
I don't know.

208
00:11:18,421 --> 00:11:21,895
Purchasing a car isn't the only expense.
You got to think about storage fees...

209
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:25,194
Wait, we could park it at our house.

210
00:11:25,987 --> 00:11:27,570
You have a real talent for this.

211
00:11:37,108 --> 00:11:38,378
Hey, it's almost lunchtime.

212
00:11:38,733 --> 00:11:39,584
Where's Flerch?

213
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,204
I don't know.

214
00:11:41,669 --> 00:11:44,913
You'd think he'd be here by
now, but he definitely isn't.

215
00:11:45,151 --> 00:11:48,396
I know. I'm so fed up, I don't even
think it's worse complaining about.

216
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:52,151
Listen, guys, I'm sorry
I blew up be here yesterday.

217
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:53,962
I guess I just kind needed a break.

218
00:11:54,692 --> 00:11:55,572
Forget it Dewey.

219
00:11:55,946 --> 00:11:57,803
We need start doing
things on our own.

220
00:11:57,895 --> 00:11:58,687
And you know what?

221
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:01,777
I think we're already doing things
we didn't think we were capable of.

222
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:08,701
3,081.

223
00:12:09,924 --> 00:12:11,187
Did you pull all night?

224
00:12:11,422 --> 00:12:15,058
Yeah. Math. I kept getting confused,
so I'm making a list of all the numbers

225
00:12:15,764 --> 00:12:18,012
3,082.

226
00:12:20,658 --> 00:12:21,547
Where do they stop?

227
00:12:23,031 --> 00:12:25,595
The state-of-the-art rehearsal
studio is essentially free,

228
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:29,734
because once the garage band makes
it big, the community gets ten
percent of the record sales.

229
00:12:29,779 --> 00:12:33,656
So it's basically the same business
model as the extreme sport camp.

230
00:12:34,804 --> 00:12:38,342
So, did you get a chance to
go through my proposal for
a girls' volleyball tournament?

231
00:12:38,355 --> 00:12:38,847
Well...

232
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:42,135
-Jim, what are you doing here?
-I had to share this with you.

233
00:12:42,455 --> 00:12:43,036
What is it?

234
00:12:43,086 --> 00:12:46,908
I was so inspired by
what your son said,

235
00:12:46,927 --> 00:12:53,340
that I went beyond the requirements of
my retainer and wrote a new constitution
for the Neighborhood Association.

236
00:12:53,609 --> 00:12:55,271
Pro bono of course.

237
00:12:55,321 --> 00:13:04,390
It's designed, so that everyone in a comunity
will have an equal voice in all decisions.
I think it'll really get people participating.

238
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,382
That sounds great, Jim. Thanks.

239
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:12,670
No, thank you for showing up at that
meeting and making me belive again.

240
00:13:16,952 --> 00:13:17,968
What a jerk.

241
00:13:18,292 --> 00:13:19,657
What? Why?

242
00:13:19,704 --> 00:13:23,635
Coming in here with his agenda like you
are not doing fantastic job when you are.

243
00:13:23,674 --> 00:13:26,872
I think he just want the voice
of the people to be heard.

244
00:13:26,922 --> 00:13:28,389
You are the voice of the people.

245
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,877
You are the one with the vision.

246
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,911
You are the one with the amazing ideas
topping out of you every second.

247
00:13:33,736 --> 00:13:35,631
- Maybe not every second.
- Yes.

248
00:13:35,788 --> 00:13:37,938
Your brain is a factory of ideas.

249
00:13:38,544 --> 00:13:40,437
Please do not close the factory.

250
00:13:41,156 --> 00:13:43,019
You know, sometimes
it's feels like a factory.

251
00:13:43,111 --> 00:13:46,050
Of course it does. You are
the leader of this community.

252
00:13:46,363 --> 00:13:48,845
Everybody recognizes
it and they love for it.

253
00:13:49,117 --> 00:13:50,505
Well don't worry son,

254
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:52,893
I won't let the people down.

255
00:13:54,593 --> 00:13:58,428
Okay, Dewey, I've got a pretty
good handle on these games, I
just want ask you some questions.

256
00:13:58,453 --> 00:13:58,926
Okay.

257
00:13:59,278 --> 00:14:03,461
When I was cheering encouragement at you,
did it ever make you feel scared or angry?

258
00:14:03,758 --> 00:14:04,833
What? No.

259
00:14:05,223 --> 00:14:05,712
Good.

260
00:14:06,181 --> 00:14:10,320
And when you lost the candy
tag, did it make you feel bad
and want to hurt yourself?

261
00:14:11,057 --> 00:14:14,106
What do you talking about Francis?
This questions are weird.

262
00:14:14,176 --> 00:14:15,967
I'm just try understand better, Dewey.

263
00:14:16,337 --> 00:14:19,073
I mean, I don't know all the right
questions ask kids like you.

264
00:14:20,081 --> 00:14:22,025
What you mean "kids like me"?

265
00:14:22,437 --> 00:14:24,267
Well, you're in that class.

266
00:14:24,467 --> 00:14:26,748
And this is a special camp
for children with your...

267
00:14:27,882 --> 00:14:28,580
needs.

268
00:14:30,067 --> 00:14:33,682
I'm not emotionally disturbed,
what the hell is wrong with you?

269
00:14:33,724 --> 00:14:35,356
There's nothing wrong with either of us.

270
00:14:35,455 --> 00:14:39,480
I'm not in that class because I'm disturbed!
I'm in that class so I can help...

271
00:14:41,698 --> 00:14:42,714
You're a jerk!

272
00:14:44,889 --> 00:14:48,720
Okay, my games obviously
have too much sugar.

273
00:14:57,268 --> 00:14:58,460
Is everything okay?

274
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:00,099
Yeah.

275
00:15:01,587 --> 00:15:03,345
<i>This is my favorite time of day.</i>

276
00:15:03,432 --> 00:15:06,688
The sun's about to come up and
my mean voice is still asleep.

277
00:15:07,016 --> 00:15:08,785
I hate walking to school in the dark.

278
00:15:09,034 --> 00:15:12,033
I have to run past people's houses
so I don't catch their nightmares.

279
00:15:12,105 --> 00:15:13,610
We have to tell Dewey about this.

280
00:15:13,641 --> 00:15:17,426
No. This is exactly the kind of thing
he doesn't want to be bothered with.

281
00:15:17,534 --> 00:15:19,308
We can't handle taking care of Flerch!

282
00:15:19,507 --> 00:15:21,240
If he dies, we're gonna
have to tell everybody!

283
00:15:21,451 --> 00:15:23,714
Are you saying I'm not doing
a good job feeding him?

284
00:15:23,863 --> 00:15:27,157
I chewed his steak for 20
minutes before I gave it to him!

285
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:33,387
Oh, help me! It's my heart, weakened
as it was by a childhood ailment!

286
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:38,312
He's dying! I totally called this!

287
00:15:38,362 --> 00:15:39,487
Give him CPR!

288
00:15:40,217 --> 00:15:43,109
- I-I'm not strong enough!
- We have to keep his heart pumping.

289
00:15:43,277 --> 00:15:45,498
Use your legs!
Chad, help him breathe.

290
00:15:45,892 --> 00:15:48,748
One, two, three, breathe!

291
00:15:49,059 --> 00:15:51,882
One, two, three, breathe!

292
00:15:52,167 --> 00:15:54,884
One, two, three, breathe!

293
00:15:55,118 --> 00:15:57,831
One, two, three, breathe!

294
00:15:57,854 --> 00:15:58,333
Wait.

295
00:15:58,594 --> 00:16:01,390
I saw this thing on TV once
where they helped a guy breathe

296
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,770
by cutting a hole in his throat
and jamming a pen in it!

297
00:16:03,942 --> 00:16:04,662
I've got a pen!

298
00:16:04,794 --> 00:16:05,950
Somebody get scissors!

299
00:16:10,612 --> 00:16:13,641
Eddie, for God sake, help me!

300
00:16:13,821 --> 00:16:14,821
They're gonna kill me!

301
00:16:15,055 --> 00:16:19,871
I'm sorry I assumed you could break-dance!
I'm actually one-sixteenth Cherokee myself!

302
00:16:26,825 --> 00:16:27,568
Dad, you okay?

303
00:16:27,632 --> 00:16:28,880
Malcolm, I couldn't sleep.

304
00:16:29,137 --> 00:16:33,358
My mind has been on fire with the possibilities
of what this neighborhood could become.

305
00:16:33,516 --> 00:16:36,048
At first it seemed crazy
and kind of stupid,

306
00:16:36,093 --> 00:16:38,163
but then I remembered what
you said about the factory!

307
00:16:38,308 --> 00:16:39,959
In the middle of the
night I had a vision.

308
00:16:40,465 --> 00:16:41,476
You had a vision without me?

309
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:45,121
- "Mulberry Village"?
- Mulberry Village.

310
00:16:45,243 --> 00:16:46,519
A new utopia!

311
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:48,257
What the hell is all this stuff?

312
00:16:48,474 --> 00:16:51,260
Just a few compulsory guidelines
to help people make the transition.

313
00:16:52,038 --> 00:16:54,682
"Failure to smile 'Hello,' $50 fine?

314
00:16:55,494 --> 00:16:57,746
Not knowing your neighbor's name: $25?

315
00:16:58,579 --> 00:17:00,648
Failure to remove your fence: $100?"

316
00:17:00,668 --> 00:17:02,208
People can be resistant to change.

317
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:07,905
- What's the "Hug your child" initiative?
- Everyone has to publicly hug
their child at least once a day.

318
00:17:08,061 --> 00:17:11,594
A hotline will be set up so that children
can inform on non-hugging parents.

319
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:14,230
You're going to make kids
inform on their parents?

320
00:17:14,268 --> 00:17:18,549
Parents, neighbors, teachers, everybody!
If they've got nothing to hide,
they've got nothing to worry about.

321
00:17:20,115 --> 00:17:21,843
Tell me about the "reeducation center."

322
00:17:21,893 --> 00:17:26,611
Oh! That's where the best, most
neighborly children will be plucked from
the corrupting influence of their families,

323
00:17:26,647 --> 00:17:29,052
and immersed in round-the-clock
friendliness training.

324
00:17:29,508 --> 00:17:31,423
I call them the Mulberry Youth.

325
00:17:32,565 --> 00:17:33,237
Dad...

326
00:17:33,999 --> 00:17:35,179
give me the fliers.

327
00:17:35,229 --> 00:17:37,921
Thank you, son, but they've already
been distributed throughout
the whole neighborhood.

328
00:17:38,371 --> 00:17:41,380
Like a modern-day Martin Luther,
I nailed them to the front doors.

329
00:17:45,103 --> 00:17:47,643
Maybe we should go out the back door and
spend the rest of the day at the library.

330
00:17:47,652 --> 00:17:51,621
Not now, Malcolm.
The villagers are coming.

331
00:17:53,371 --> 00:17:56,412
Look, I told you, leave me alone.

332
00:17:56,455 --> 00:17:59,678
I'm just going to ask your
teacher if I can have ten minutes
with your buddies at recess.

333
00:18:05,203 --> 00:18:06,700
What the hell happened?!

334
00:18:07,814 --> 00:18:09,007
Isn't it obvious?

335
00:18:09,476 --> 00:18:11,947
I know we're not supposed
to ask for help, Dewey, but...

336
00:18:12,793 --> 00:18:14,396
this one kind of got away from us.

337
00:18:15,451 --> 00:18:17,562
We gotta get out of here.
Let's go call the police.

338
00:18:17,914 --> 00:18:18,949
You're just gonna bail?

339
00:18:19,262 --> 00:18:20,599
You don't understand these kids.

340
00:18:20,815 --> 00:18:23,254
If I fix this problem, there's
going to be a hundred more.

341
00:18:23,558 --> 00:18:25,143
It never stops with them!

342
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:26,133
Dewey...

343
00:18:27,605 --> 00:18:29,813
you don't get to choose the
people who need your help.

344
00:18:31,609 --> 00:18:34,638
Look, I don't know much,
but I do know two things.

345
00:18:34,868 --> 00:18:36,998
These kids need your
help, you gotta do it.

346
00:18:37,417 --> 00:18:40,602
And even though I've never
met him, that guy is a total dink.

347
00:18:55,779 --> 00:18:59,324
I thought when I decided to help,
something would come to me,
but I'm completely blank.

348
00:18:59,503 --> 00:19:00,900
You're all going to jail.

349
00:19:01,274 --> 00:19:05,517
If you untie me in the next five
seconds, you and you alone
will see some slight leniency.

350
00:19:06,629 --> 00:19:08,650
Lanyards belong in the lanyard box.

351
00:19:08,695 --> 00:19:08,958
What?

352
00:19:09,364 --> 00:19:11,436
That's my lanyard. I made it.

353
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:17,119
Mr. Flerch is going to flip out if you
don't put it back in the lanyard box.

354
00:19:17,822 --> 00:19:19,065
You couldn't have made this.

355
00:19:19,447 --> 00:19:21,607
I bought it at a truck stop
200 miles from here.

356
00:19:24,772 --> 00:19:26,269
Can I see that, Francis?

357
00:19:28,622 --> 00:19:32,114
Can you think of any connection
between the thousands of lanyards

358
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:35,296
that were made by the emotionally
disturbed children at your school,

359
00:19:35,963 --> 00:19:39,032
and this one my brother found
for sale at a retail outlet?

360
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:46,154
Mr. Jeffers, I would be horrified
to think that a public school principal

361
00:19:46,408 --> 00:19:48,992
would use innocent
children as slave labor.

362
00:19:49,113 --> 00:19:50,804
I don't know what you're
talking about, young man.

363
00:19:51,337 --> 00:19:53,037
It was all his idea!

364
00:19:53,244 --> 00:19:55,161
I'm just his obedient stooge!

365
00:19:55,281 --> 00:19:57,939
He dangled Assistant Vice
Principal in front of me!

366
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:02,114
It came with parking!

367
00:20:03,618 --> 00:20:05,517
I wonder who would
get the worst penalty.

368
00:20:06,098 --> 00:20:09,498
A bunch of emotionally disturbed kids
who tied people up for a little while...

369
00:20:10,061 --> 00:20:13,716
or the trusted public servant
who forced them into slavery?

370
00:20:14,615 --> 00:20:19,982
We could ask a judge, or everyone
could just keep quiet about everything.

371
00:20:20,822 --> 00:20:21,995
Sound okay to you guys?

372
00:20:24,081 --> 00:20:25,097
That depends.

373
00:20:25,219 --> 00:20:27,994
Can we get five minutes alone with
these guys before you untie them?

374
00:20:37,412 --> 00:20:39,884
-What's up with Mom?
-She just saw my report card.

375
00:20:39,924 --> 00:20:41,693
I flunked out of every single class.

376
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:43,046
What?

377
00:20:43,343 --> 00:20:46,001
Every single one of my finals,
I got every question wrong.

378
00:20:46,426 --> 00:20:47,168
Oh, my God.

379
00:20:47,657 --> 00:20:50,198
I know. Now I get to
repeat my senior year!

380
00:20:51,341 --> 00:20:52,181
Isn't this great?

381
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:53,587
I worked so hard for this.

382
00:20:53,977 --> 00:20:57,760
I had to make sure I flunked every
class so completely, I couldn't
make it up in summer school.

383
00:20:58,093 --> 00:21:01,904
Now I don't have to move
out or go to college or get
a job for a whole 'nother year!

384
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:05,260
This is the greatest
achievement of my entire life!

385
00:21:06,168 --> 00:21:06,941
Yeah, I know, Mom.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
