1
00:00:00,482 --> 00:00:02,585
Mom didn't go shopping.
There's no snacks.

2
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:04,793
I don't want to watch
a movie without snacks.

3
00:00:04,823 --> 00:00:05,673
There's always...

4
00:00:06,251 --> 00:00:07,215
trail mix.

5
00:00:08,296 --> 00:00:08,797
Yeah.

6
00:00:10,302 --> 00:00:11,286
Trail mix.

7
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:20,587
-Good movie.
-Yeah.

8
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:31,440
Malcolm in the Middle - 6.17 - Butterflies

9
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:38,440
Synchronisation par Tyno,
Script original par Raceman.

10
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:45,440
Forom.com, Life-is-Unfair.tk
& Malcolm-France.com

11
00:01:01,632 --> 00:01:07,532
Usually I spend every minute I'm at
Lucky Aide cursing Mom for making me
work here, but lately it hasn't seemed so bad.

12
00:01:09,393 --> 00:01:10,243
I'm not sure why.

13
00:01:10,898 --> 00:01:14,804
Malcolm, you were right. I put
a greasy bag in the fridge, and
Craig put his name on it.

14
00:01:14,834 --> 00:01:18,276
Yeah, the only way to protect anything
is to put it in a nonfat yogurt carton.

15
00:01:18,306 --> 00:01:19,156
That's brilliant.

16
00:01:19,709 --> 00:01:20,909
Wait. You got something.

17
00:01:22,129 --> 00:01:22,747
Thanks.

18
00:01:23,518 --> 00:01:24,690
She didn't have anything.

19
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,607
So, hey, it turns out I don't
have to go with my parents to
Yosemite over spring break.

20
00:01:28,637 --> 00:01:30,112
So I guess you'll be
in town then, huh?

21
00:01:30,142 --> 00:01:30,632
Looks like it.

22
00:01:30,662 --> 00:01:31,830
You know, me, too.
Maybe we can...

23
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,022
Malcolm, your break doesn't
start for another two minutes.

24
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:35,552
Wendy, your break is over now.

25
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:39,390
This is why orphans
get all the hot girls.

26
00:01:40,048 --> 00:01:43,714
Oh, God. I've got graveyard
shift for the next two weeks?

27
00:01:43,757 --> 00:01:46,681
I didn't know I had any joy left
in my life to be sucked out.

28
00:01:46,711 --> 00:01:48,676
I guess you're going to have to
take the bus to work, Malcolm.

29
00:01:48,706 --> 00:01:50,256
You're going to be on your own.

30
00:01:50,973 --> 00:01:52,343
Great. Figures.

31
00:01:53,144 --> 00:01:57,094
If I can bite through my tongue till my
teeth meet maybe Mom won't see me smile.

32
00:02:01,507 --> 00:02:03,895
All right, here's Jamie's
schedule for the next two weeks.

33
00:02:03,925 --> 00:02:08,394
-He needs a bath at 6:00, 8:00
and before he goes to bed.
-We talked about Jamie's schedule.

34
00:02:08,424 --> 00:02:12,894
-I want to talk about our schedule.
-We already talked about that schedule.

35
00:02:12,895 --> 00:02:17,260
I know, but I like coming
home for lunch to be a special
treat, not just for my survival.

36
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:20,863
Well, I'm not happy about it
either, but working graveyard
is just part of the job.

37
00:02:20,893 --> 00:02:23,643
Have you told Malcolm you're
making him do it with you?

38
00:02:39,036 --> 00:02:39,866
Two days ago.

39
00:02:44,004 --> 00:02:45,904
-What are you so happy about?
-Nothing.

40
00:02:46,078 --> 00:02:48,314
I've just never had the
whole bed to myself before.

41
00:02:48,344 --> 00:02:51,364
You stay off my side of the bed!
I don't care if I'm not there.

42
00:02:51,394 --> 00:02:51,895
Okay.

43
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,130
And stop smiling!

44
00:02:53,969 --> 00:02:54,413
Okay.

45
00:02:56,015 --> 00:03:00,715
The only bright spot in all this is
that Reese has an even crappier
spring break job than I do.

46
00:03:05,755 --> 00:03:10,305
You didn't do too bad today, kid.
Till that possum got up your
pant leg, you were way ahead.

47
00:03:10,515 --> 00:03:13,216
So... he didn't have rabies, did he?

48
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:15,695
No. No, no, no, no.
He checked out fine.

49
00:03:17,082 --> 00:03:20,982
Say, uh, you going to be able to sit up
soon 'cause we're almost at your house.

50
00:03:21,197 --> 00:03:24,998
These fumes are kind of strong. Can I get
one of those paper masks next time?

51
00:03:25,191 --> 00:03:26,841
Do I look like I'm made of money?

52
00:03:30,652 --> 00:03:32,802
You got a different
kind of a job tomorrow.

53
00:03:34,356 --> 00:03:35,174
<i>What's this?</i>

54
00:03:35,204 --> 00:03:36,679
<i>That's a thousand caterpillars.</i>

55
00:03:36,709 --> 00:03:43,759
Tomorrow morning, get up before dawn, I want
you to go around the neighborhood, sprinkle those
on the rose bushes, flower beds, front lawns...

56
00:03:43,917 --> 00:03:48,267
And then I want you to take my
business card and drop it in the
mailbox, you understand?

57
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:49,992
Why do you sound very far away?

58
00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:52,753
Don't go to sleep for a while.

59
00:03:59,593 --> 00:04:04,713
It sucks you have to work the night
shift. Now you're going to miss the
party. Debbie's parents are out of town.

60
00:04:04,743 --> 00:04:05,993
Probably won't miss much.

61
00:04:06,122 --> 00:04:09,172
It's just the same boring people
doing the same boring stuff.

62
00:04:09,575 --> 00:04:12,225
Whoa, I gotta run.
Skinny-dipping starts at midnight.

63
00:04:16,315 --> 00:04:16,965
Hey, Malcolm.

64
00:04:17,675 --> 00:04:21,098
At what age do you just accept that
your life is a piece of rotten garbage
and always will be?

65
00:04:21,128 --> 00:04:21,726
Twenty-two.

66
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:25,130
But that doesn't mean you can't
enjoy the heck out of every moment.

67
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,210
Take tonight.
You're in for a real treat.

68
00:04:27,465 --> 00:04:29,765
There's a different rhythm
to the night shift.

69
00:04:30,706 --> 00:04:37,314
It's a camaraderie, a brotherhood of
kindred souls, a nocturnal fraternity of
the prowlers of the inky netherworld.

70
00:04:37,595 --> 00:04:40,795
-Hello, fellow traveler.
-Where's the toothpaste?
-I'm on a break.

71
00:04:41,756 --> 00:04:45,506
Make sure all the pens are cap-side up
with the pocket clips facing forward.

72
00:04:46,039 --> 00:04:47,890
This is the benefit
of graveyard shift.

73
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:52,229
You don't have all that chaos that goes
on during the daytime. You can get things
organized the way they're meant to be.

74
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:55,291
You're just trying to torture me.
That's why I'm here, just admit it.

75
00:04:55,321 --> 00:04:56,757
You're here because
you need the money.

76
00:04:56,787 --> 00:05:00,437
-I give you three-quarters of my paycheck.
-That's why you need the money.

77
00:05:02,365 --> 00:05:03,716
That's weird.
Did you see anyone?

78
00:05:03,746 --> 00:05:04,035
What?

79
00:05:04,565 --> 00:05:08,471
Someone left a candy wrapper and
change on the counter here, but
nobody's been in the store for hours.

80
00:05:08,501 --> 00:05:09,716
It was probably a mouse.

81
00:05:09,841 --> 00:05:11,591
A mouse that left
the exact change?

82
00:05:11,596 --> 00:05:16,890
I played tic-tac-toe with a chicken
at the county fair, and it beat me
eight times in a row.

83
00:05:17,361 --> 00:05:19,230
Don't shortchange animals.

84
00:05:20,135 --> 00:05:21,485
I didn't see anyone though.

85
00:05:22,606 --> 00:05:23,450
Nevermind.

86
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:26,182
Wait, aren't you even
curious how that happened?

87
00:05:26,867 --> 00:05:29,417
Malcolm, everything doesn't
have to be fascinating.

88
00:05:31,548 --> 00:05:36,536
Now it looks like the guy in the
hockey mask is dead, right? But
just keep your eye on that coffin.

89
00:05:38,941 --> 00:05:39,558
Hold on.

90
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:41,527
Why aren't you at work?

91
00:05:41,873 --> 00:05:45,214
I don't want to hear that you're
too good to crawl under houses
poisoning rats all day.

92
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:48,395
There are ten guys with MBA's
who would love to have that job.

93
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:51,614
I didn't quit. I showed up this
morning and the cops were there.

94
00:05:51,644 --> 00:05:54,894
It turns out Mr. Krijak was renting
out his gas tanks for parties.

95
00:05:54,957 --> 00:05:58,107
Now I have to dump this stupid
box of caterpillars... for free!

96
00:05:59,594 --> 00:06:01,871
Have a nice death, puss-bags.

97
00:06:02,207 --> 00:06:02,758
Hey!

98
00:06:03,731 --> 00:06:04,580
Get off of me.

99
00:06:06,161 --> 00:06:08,168
Oh, a tough guy, huh?

100
00:06:10,162 --> 00:06:10,625
Hey...

101
00:06:11,223 --> 00:06:12,640
Cut it out, that tickles.

102
00:06:33,342 --> 00:06:34,635
Craig, did you do this?

103
00:06:34,789 --> 00:06:35,310
Do what?

104
00:06:35,715 --> 00:06:37,415
Those vitamins that
were recalled.

105
00:06:37,461 --> 00:06:38,800
Did you clear off this shelf?

106
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:40,065
Doesn't sound like me.

107
00:06:40,797 --> 00:06:43,441
Six coats of wax,
and I buttered up my socks.

108
00:06:43,485 --> 00:06:45,119
The record's going down.

109
00:06:45,337 --> 00:06:48,559
You know, things have been
getting really weird around here.

110
00:06:49,215 --> 00:06:50,365
I mean, think about it.

111
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:54,124
Last night, all the clocks
in the display case were
synchronized to the same time.

112
00:06:54,154 --> 00:06:55,224
And the night before that,

113
00:06:55,254 --> 00:06:57,694
all the fingerprints were
cleaned off the freezer doors.

114
00:06:57,724 --> 00:07:00,874
Malcolm, I think you're forgetting
the graveyard shift motto...

115
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:01,976
"Who cares?"

116
00:07:10,993 --> 00:07:12,776
It doesn't matter if
no one else knows.

117
00:07:12,806 --> 00:07:13,462
You know.

118
00:07:17,521 --> 00:07:20,260
Okay, Dewey gets the
pancakes and eggs.

119
00:07:20,781 --> 00:07:24,215
And Lois has the veal parmesan.

120
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:25,893
Oh, look at you, Jamie.

121
00:07:26,009 --> 00:07:29,829
You have changed so much in just a week.
Your head's almost symmetrical.

122
00:07:29,926 --> 00:07:32,211
Better eat up... don't you need
to be in bed before I go to work?

123
00:07:32,241 --> 00:07:35,701
Honey, I'm spending sometime with my son
who I've barely seen in the last week.

124
00:07:35,731 --> 00:07:37,337
You've got 18 years for that.

125
00:07:37,595 --> 00:07:39,195
I'm only asking
for ten minutes.

126
00:07:40,913 --> 00:07:44,000
Wow, another great
night's sleep.

127
00:07:44,447 --> 00:07:48,768
No fighting for blankets,
no elbows in my face, or anything worse.

128
00:07:49,559 --> 00:07:51,141
Just all the room in the world.

129
00:07:52,173 --> 00:07:54,275
Don't freak out when you get
into your side of the bed.

130
00:07:54,305 --> 00:07:56,655
It looks bad, but most
of it's only a Moon Pie.

131
00:07:56,991 --> 00:08:00,318
Did you know the Latin name for
this little guy is Danaus plexippus,

132
00:08:00,348 --> 00:08:02,980
and that he actually crawls
out of his own skin to pupate?

133
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:05,410
Then the outer layer
hardens into the chrysalis.

134
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,452
That's Greek for "golden."

135
00:08:06,482 --> 00:08:07,938
And once they turn
into butterflies,

136
00:08:07,968 --> 00:08:09,878
they can migrate
up to 2,000 miles.

137
00:08:10,206 --> 00:08:11,206
Pretty awesome, huh?

138
00:08:11,797 --> 00:08:13,797
Oh, got to feed them
some more milkweed.

139
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:16,485
Wow.

140
00:08:16,601 --> 00:08:21,250
That's the first time I've ever seen
Reese take a concerned interest
in another living thing.

141
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:23,890
It's kind of nice to know he's
got a compassionate side.

142
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,970
I want those revolting bugs in
the trash by tomorrow morning.

143
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:31,082
Craig.

144
00:08:31,371 --> 00:08:32,371
Take a look at this.

145
00:08:32,518 --> 00:08:35,918
If you don't mind, I'm trying to
get in a quick nap before my break.

146
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:37,510
Seriously. Check out this guy.

147
00:08:39,193 --> 00:08:41,604
He's here, and then two hours later...

148
00:08:44,696 --> 00:08:46,808
...he's still there,
only in a different outfit.

149
00:08:46,838 --> 00:08:49,982
And three hours later,
he shows up again in another outfit.

150
00:08:55,921 --> 00:08:56,441
Whoa!

151
00:08:56,856 --> 00:08:57,773
Did you see that?!

152
00:08:58,101 --> 00:08:59,594
Malcolm, please.

153
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:02,610
If I don't get my 16 hours, I'm a bear.

154
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:39,097
What are doing in there?

155
00:09:40,243 --> 00:09:41,028
Shopping.

156
00:09:41,088 --> 00:09:42,088
You're not shopping.

157
00:09:42,346 --> 00:09:44,046
You're the guy from
the videotape.

158
00:09:47,838 --> 00:09:48,814
You're living here?

159
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:50,559
Malcolm, please.
Your mom's going to hear us.

160
00:09:50,589 --> 00:09:52,989
How do you know my name?
How do you know my mom?

161
00:09:53,222 --> 00:09:54,572
I've been here for a while.

162
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:59,861
And you were right about moving
the tortilla chips to the salsa aisle.
The sales are up at least 15%.

163
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:01,531
I knew it. Wait.

164
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,410
How long's "a while?"

165
00:10:03,701 --> 00:10:05,486
Three years in January.

166
00:10:06,073 --> 00:10:08,956
I was going to move over to foot care,
but once you get unpacked, it's...

167
00:10:08,986 --> 00:10:12,053
You've been living in this store
for three years? Are you crazy?

168
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:12,733
I don't know.

169
00:10:13,105 --> 00:10:13,896
I just...

170
00:10:15,043 --> 00:10:17,724
Malcolm, I had this
super high-pressure job.

171
00:10:18,467 --> 00:10:24,384
People were constantly hounding me for
answers, decisions, budgets, signatures.
My-My nerves were a total wreck.

172
00:10:24,442 --> 00:10:31,566
I was wandering around here waiting for
my Xanax refill, my-my cell phone and
BlackBerry both going off, and I saw this crack.

173
00:10:32,713 --> 00:10:36,630
And I decided to hide in there,
just for a few minutes, and...

174
00:10:38,819 --> 00:10:40,054
...it was fantastic.

175
00:10:40,786 --> 00:10:42,041
I didn't want to leave.

176
00:10:42,523 --> 00:10:48,109
And then I didn't, and no one
noticed, so I just... stayed.

177
00:10:49,907 --> 00:10:51,729
You never left the
store in all that time?

178
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:55,018
You guys are pretty well-stocked here.
Lots of canned goods, toiletries...

179
00:10:55,048 --> 00:10:58,806
Every day I clean a different third
of my body in the bathroom sink.

180
00:10:59,095 --> 00:11:00,947
-But you can't just live here.
-Why not?

181
00:11:00,977 --> 00:11:02,592
I-I pay for everything I use,

182
00:11:03,012 --> 00:11:08,638
I help out whenever I can. I clean
spills, I change light bulbs. I have
saved Craig's life at least five times.

183
00:11:08,754 --> 00:11:10,662
You're not going to
tell on me, are you?

184
00:11:10,692 --> 00:11:11,442
I don't know...

185
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:12,310
What about Wendy?

186
00:11:13,346 --> 00:11:14,346
I know you like her.

187
00:11:15,229 --> 00:11:16,179
And I can help you.

188
00:11:16,356 --> 00:11:19,588
I see her all the time.
I overhear her conversations.

189
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:23,783
I know everything about her, like why
she broke up with her last boyfriend.

190
00:11:23,814 --> 00:11:25,249
-Why?
-Will you let me stay?

191
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:29,306
Yeah, all right.

192
00:11:30,112 --> 00:11:33,623
Okay, so I'm entrusting my love
life to a burned-out hermit who
lives behind a ball cage.

193
00:11:33,653 --> 00:11:35,603
That doesn't make me
a desperate loser.

194
00:11:36,607 --> 00:11:37,607
I'm doing it anyway.

195
00:11:41,064 --> 00:11:43,765
-Okay, Reese...
-Shh. Dad, they're pupating.

196
00:11:44,151 --> 00:11:46,258
They need peace and quiet while they're
developing their delicate new...

197
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:47,396
We got to dump the bugs.

198
00:11:47,426 --> 00:11:47,774
What?!

199
00:11:47,852 --> 00:11:49,650
Sorry. Your mother
wants them gone.

200
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:50,905
No, you can't do this.

201
00:11:51,213 --> 00:11:52,283
They never hurt anyone.

202
00:11:52,313 --> 00:11:54,863
They have no protection,
no one to watch over them.

203
00:11:55,235 --> 00:11:57,087
Oh, crap, I'm too late.

204
00:11:57,319 --> 00:11:59,017
You bonded with
them, didn't you?

205
00:11:59,924 --> 00:12:01,795
Well, welcome to my world.

206
00:12:01,979 --> 00:12:07,202
Now you're stuck with feelings
of unjustified love for a bunch of
mindless, ungrateful eating machines.

207
00:12:07,781 --> 00:12:09,035
See how you like it.

208
00:12:09,401 --> 00:12:11,351
At least yours will
be dead in a month.

209
00:12:11,756 --> 00:12:12,806
Then I can keep them?

210
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:14,504
Throw them under the
tarp with the Playboys.

211
00:12:14,534 --> 00:12:19,534
And you better be a sullen jerk
to me in front of your mother so
she doesn't get wise. You got that?

212
00:12:24,163 --> 00:12:25,185
-Go on.
-Okay.

213
00:12:25,436 --> 00:12:29,642
I overheard her on the phone saying
she's sick of guys who play games.

214
00:12:29,855 --> 00:12:32,989
She says she just wants someone
who's honest and straightforward.

215
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:35,565
That's great. I'm totally
honest and straightforward.

216
00:12:35,595 --> 00:12:37,995
Actually, you're more like
blunt and aggressive.

217
00:12:38,074 --> 00:12:40,822
That's okay. You just got to slow down,
give yourself a chance.

218
00:12:40,852 --> 00:12:46,850
She spent 22 minutes and 18 seconds
looking through Hallmark cards. She
needs to be treated gently.

219
00:12:46,985 --> 00:12:48,385
Here's some stuff she likes.

220
00:12:48,832 --> 00:12:52,131
Movies, music, shampoo
brands, paper towels...

221
00:12:52,412 --> 00:12:55,237
Uh, well, some of it's more useful
than others, but learn it all.

222
00:12:55,267 --> 00:12:58,150
When the time's right, you can show her
how much you have in common with her.

223
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,280
Thanks. This is great.

224
00:12:59,405 --> 00:13:00,620
Who are you talking to?

225
00:13:00,832 --> 00:13:03,495
Um, I was just... singing.

226
00:13:03,898 --> 00:13:05,210
Thanks, this is great,

227
00:13:05,499 --> 00:13:07,467
As long as we're together, girl.

228
00:13:07,795 --> 00:13:08,587
Yeah.

229
00:13:08,973 --> 00:13:10,073
<i>In my car.</i>

230
00:13:12,494 --> 00:13:13,944
I want you to know something.

231
00:13:14,162 --> 00:13:16,940
I've been sleeping in that
bed by myself for a week.

232
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:23,438
A week without sharing covers, a week
without being smashed, and a week
without having anyone's butt shoved into my face.

233
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,210
So, what are you angry about?

234
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:28,462
Because during the last week,
I've grown half an inch.

235
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,570
You lied to me.

236
00:13:29,697 --> 00:13:32,352
I'm not the smallest kid in
my class from my genetics.

237
00:13:32,382 --> 00:13:35,422
It's because I've been stuffed into
a bed with Malcolm all my life.

238
00:13:35,452 --> 00:13:36,958
Whoo, you don't know that.

239
00:13:37,556 --> 00:13:40,997
It could be all the crap we feed you,
or the chemical plant near the park.

240
00:13:41,027 --> 00:13:42,495
-Dad...
-Dewey, I'm sorry.

241
00:13:42,825 --> 00:13:47,557
But we can't afford to buy you your
own bed. You'll just have to grow
after Malcolm goes off to college.

242
00:13:47,587 --> 00:13:49,593
Oh, no, then Jamie's going into it.

243
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:52,958
Well, at least you'll always
be bigger than he is.

244
00:13:58,569 --> 00:14:02,552
Yesterday, I passed Wendy at the
time clock and casually mentioned
how I liked the smell of bookstores.

245
00:14:02,582 --> 00:14:05,330
She was so charmed,
I didn't even care how stupid that is.

246
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,710
All right, what's going on?

247
00:14:06,855 --> 00:14:07,799
What are you talking about?

248
00:14:07,829 --> 00:14:10,629
You haven't complained about
one thing in the last week.

249
00:14:10,728 --> 00:14:13,467
The only time you don't complain is
when you're hiding something from me.

250
00:14:13,497 --> 00:14:14,498
I'm not hiding
anything from you.

251
00:14:14,528 --> 00:14:15,039
Malcolm.

252
00:14:15,079 --> 00:14:15,779
There you are.

253
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:18,726
Remember last week when you
were trying to figure out how that
spill got cleaned up?

254
00:14:18,756 --> 00:14:19,301
No.

255
00:14:19,386 --> 00:14:23,294
But remember those vitamins
getting pulled from the shelf, and
the ice cream case getting cleaned,

256
00:14:23,324 --> 00:14:27,159
and those socks being left out to dry
and all those other things that seemed
like they were happening by themselves?

257
00:14:27,189 --> 00:14:27,981
Not now, Craig.

258
00:14:28,054 --> 00:14:30,136
I figured it out.
I know what's going on.

259
00:14:31,094 --> 00:14:32,811
The store is haunted.

260
00:14:32,891 --> 00:14:33,324
Craig...

261
00:14:33,348 --> 00:14:36,148
-All right, what's in this bag?
-Nothing. I'm restocking.

262
00:14:36,951 --> 00:14:37,878
Fresh fruit?

263
00:14:39,498 --> 00:14:41,215
A package of
all-cotton underwear?

264
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:43,835
A decent book?

265
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:45,282
We don't sell this stuff.

266
00:14:46,112 --> 00:14:47,096
Okay, fine.

267
00:14:47,167 --> 00:14:49,521
If you must know,
I was restocking my locker.

268
00:14:49,888 --> 00:14:55,358
I've been having intense stomach problems,
and that's what the fruit is for, and the
underwear, and sadly, the book, too.

269
00:14:55,388 --> 00:14:58,938
And now that you've publicly humiliated
me, can I go about my business?

270
00:15:02,905 --> 00:15:08,808
Okay, not bad. It's plausible,
embarrassing enough for the outburst,
and essentially unprovable.

271
00:15:08,847 --> 00:15:10,487
I just have to stand my ground.

272
00:15:29,784 --> 00:15:32,485
Attention Lucky
Aide trespasser.

273
00:15:33,179 --> 00:15:36,632
You do not get to do this.
You do not get to live off the grid.

274
00:15:37,116 --> 00:15:42,669
If anyone on the planet was entitled to
hide from all the aggravation, it would
be me, but I don't, do you understand?

275
00:15:42,699 --> 00:15:45,399
<i>No one gets to shirk their
share of the misery.</i>

276
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:49,608
Everyone has to be stuck
in this together. That's what's fair.
Those are the rules.

277
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:54,054
Now, you obviously know me, so you
know what I'm willing to do to find you.

278
00:15:54,084 --> 00:15:57,074
So save us both the
time and come out now.

279
00:16:08,088 --> 00:16:09,217
Let me handle this.

280
00:16:12,526 --> 00:16:15,186
Do you know anything about
a guy living in the store?

281
00:16:24,384 --> 00:16:25,503
No!

282
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:35,374
No, Reese, you're not
coming in here with those.

283
00:16:35,404 --> 00:16:37,304
But they'll freeze
to death out there!

284
00:16:37,426 --> 00:16:40,753
I'm sorry, son. I already promised
your mom I would get rid of them.

285
00:16:40,783 --> 00:16:44,101
And I have four or five other lies
in the fire I can't jeopardize.

286
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:45,891
The bugs stay outside.

287
00:16:45,905 --> 00:16:46,368
Fine.

288
00:16:47,255 --> 00:16:48,278
Then I'll...

289
00:16:48,451 --> 00:16:50,004
I'll... I'll fight you for it.

290
00:16:50,037 --> 00:16:54,068
Reese, you already fought me
for the last English muffin two
weeks ago, and I cleaned your clock.

291
00:16:54,098 --> 00:16:57,124
But this time, I'm fighting for
something I love even more
than those muffins.

292
00:16:57,154 --> 00:16:58,963
Keep your voice down.
You're going to wake Jamie.

293
00:16:58,993 --> 00:17:02,843
Good. I want him to hear what kind of
heartless monster his father really is.

294
00:17:03,194 --> 00:17:05,216
Come on, old man, let's go.

295
00:17:05,263 --> 00:17:10,213
All right. But if I throw my back
out again beating you up, I am
going to kick the crap out of you.

296
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:20,899
Well, the police
are on their way.

297
00:17:21,275 --> 00:17:24,670
Three years you've been
living here. Unbelievable.

298
00:17:24,786 --> 00:17:28,085
Didn't you once give me the Heimlich
maneuver in Snacks and Nuts?

299
00:17:28,521 --> 00:17:29,921
You've got to learn to chew.

300
00:17:30,329 --> 00:17:31,699
Easier said, my friend.

301
00:17:32,017 --> 00:17:34,236
Mom, can't you just let him go?

302
00:17:34,602 --> 00:17:36,602
He didn't even really
do anything wrong.

303
00:17:36,831 --> 00:17:38,306
He paid for everything he took.

304
00:17:38,336 --> 00:17:40,767
He helped out around the store.
The guy's just living here.

305
00:17:40,797 --> 00:17:41,522
What's wrong with that?

306
00:17:41,552 --> 00:17:45,756
I could just disappear, go to
the Wal-Mart down the block.
I've heard great things about them.

307
00:17:45,786 --> 00:17:47,330
He broke the rules, Malcolm.

308
00:17:47,883 --> 00:17:48,969
The rules matter.

309
00:17:49,574 --> 00:17:52,245
Rules say we get paid time and
a half for the graveyard shift.

310
00:17:52,275 --> 00:17:55,025
The rules say trespassers
are dealt with by the police.

311
00:17:55,072 --> 00:17:58,968
You can't just pick and choose what
rules you want to follow, or the whole
system breaks down.

312
00:17:58,998 --> 00:18:00,493
-But...
-Malcolm, I'm sorry.

313
00:18:00,883 --> 00:18:04,233
But as long as I'm working here,
I can't bend the rules for anyone.

314
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:08,037
7:30. Shift's over.

315
00:18:08,731 --> 00:18:09,473
What are you doing?

316
00:18:09,503 --> 00:18:11,203
I'm off the clock.
I'm going home.

317
00:18:11,326 --> 00:18:13,376
Everybody else can do
whatever they want.

318
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:17,660
But they better do it quick.
They don't have a lot of time.

319
00:18:22,998 --> 00:18:24,484
-Thank you.
-For what?

320
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:32,241
Great. She lets that guy walk, but makes
a federal case whenever I put my phone
number in with the birth control pills.

321
00:18:33,463 --> 00:18:35,614
-Hi, Malcolm.
-Oh, hey, Wendy.

322
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:37,397
Did you get the blue
irises I sent you?

323
00:18:37,427 --> 00:18:38,546
Yeah, I did.

324
00:18:38,981 --> 00:18:41,381
How did you know those
were my favorite flowers?

325
00:18:41,387 --> 00:18:44,129
Well, you know, I guess we just
really have a lot in common.

326
00:18:44,159 --> 00:18:47,759
Like loving grilled cheese and tomato
sandwiches and Stephen King books.

327
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:51,191
I wouldn't be surprised if you
were a big Coldplay fan, too.

328
00:18:52,198 --> 00:18:53,598
What the hell are you doing?

329
00:18:53,809 --> 00:18:56,046
Following me around?
Are you stalking me?

330
00:18:56,452 --> 00:18:58,752
No. No, no.
I guess we're just really in sync.

331
00:18:59,557 --> 00:19:03,557
-Is that so weird? I mean, sometimes two people...
-You stay away from me, creep.

332
00:19:07,307 --> 00:19:08,257
Don't worry, buddy.

333
00:19:08,928 --> 00:19:10,452
Even I get that sometimes.

334
00:19:12,864 --> 00:19:16,336
Dad, the toilet lid was up,
and Jamie's tongue is blue again.

335
00:19:24,113 --> 00:19:25,723
Did you spend all
night out there?

336
00:19:25,753 --> 00:19:26,659
My choice.

337
00:19:26,794 --> 00:19:28,839
It's very bracing out there.

338
00:19:29,226 --> 00:19:35,318
Now why don't you help me
into the shower and see if
we can't save your dad's toes.

339
00:19:43,865 --> 00:19:44,869
Oh, my God.

340
00:19:45,447 --> 00:19:46,836
Winston, is that you?

341
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:49,203
Geez.

342
00:19:50,007 --> 00:19:54,107
I thought you were going to
look totally gay as a butterfly,
but you look amazing.

343
00:19:55,835 --> 00:19:56,375
Harv?

344
00:19:58,073 --> 00:19:59,269
And Julio.

345
00:19:59,813 --> 00:20:01,259
I knew you'd be
one of the first.

346
00:20:01,289 --> 00:20:03,189
You were always the
head of the class.

347
00:20:06,453 --> 00:20:07,823
This is fantastic.

348
00:20:08,536 --> 00:20:09,829
Look at all of you guys.

349
00:20:12,345 --> 00:20:12,808
Wow.

350
00:20:14,544 --> 00:20:16,344
I forgot how many
of you there were.

351
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:18,699
Okay.

352
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:20,442
That's a lot of fluttering.

353
00:20:21,465 --> 00:20:22,429
That's enough.

354
00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:28,263
Get off of me.

355
00:20:29,286 --> 00:20:30,694
Get the hell off of me!

356
00:20:31,402 --> 00:20:32,463
Help!

357
00:20:32,907 --> 00:20:33,737
Help!

358
00:20:40,008 --> 00:20:44,117
Good news. Wendy's restraining order has
been reduced from 100 feet to 50 feet.

359
00:20:44,445 --> 00:20:47,495
If I can yell loud enough,
I think I can straighten this out.

360
00:20:47,733 --> 00:20:49,121
It's so good to have you back.

361
00:20:49,151 --> 00:20:51,801
-Oh. You coming home for lunch?
-Mm, and coffee break.

362
00:20:55,863 --> 00:20:56,962
No, no!

363
00:20:58,467 --> 00:21:01,592
Okay, one more week,
then that joke's off limits.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
