<b>NOTICE OF SUSPENSION</b>

2
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:16,686
Here you go, Jamie.

3
00:00:21,143 --> 00:00:21,962
What are you doing?

4
00:00:21,992 --> 00:00:23,742
Mom's been going
through the trash.

5
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,800
Malcolm in the Middle - 6.18 - Ida's Dance

6
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,800
Synchronisation par Tyno,
Script original par Raceman.

Forom.com, Life-is-Unfair.tk
& Malcolm-France.com

8
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:02,113
Check it out.

9
00:01:02,606 --> 00:01:04,163
This is my homework.

10
00:01:04,566 --> 00:01:09,698
I've spent every night this year
cramming my skull full of integral
calculus and conversational Latin.

11
00:01:09,774 --> 00:01:12,227
I just needed one class that
wasn't going to kill me.

12
00:01:12,257 --> 00:01:15,518
And then I saw it...
Music Appreciation.

13
00:01:15,695 --> 00:01:17,392
It's an actual class.

14
00:01:17,566 --> 00:01:22,158
All I have to do is listen to a CD
and write down how it makes me feel.

15
00:01:22,398 --> 00:01:23,551
It's such an easy "A."

16
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:27,243
No matter how easy an "A" is,
a "D" is always easier, Malcolm.

17
00:01:27,247 --> 00:01:30,303
Not in this class. I better get
started on my homework.

18
00:01:40,257 --> 00:01:40,720
"F"!

19
00:01:41,366 --> 00:01:43,934
I can't believe that goateed
moron gave me an "F."

20
00:01:44,337 --> 00:01:46,737
"You obviously didn't
even listen to the piece."

21
00:01:46,801 --> 00:01:48,251
I listened to it. You saw me.

22
00:01:48,437 --> 00:01:52,874
You know, with the right kind of pen,
you can turn that "F" into a "P."

23
00:01:54,593 --> 00:01:56,522
Mom? Finally!

24
00:01:56,571 --> 00:01:58,038
Where have you been?

25
00:01:58,325 --> 00:02:01,275
I've been calling for weeks.
I must have left ten messages.

26
00:02:01,292 --> 00:02:03,094
What on Earth is
going on up there?

27
00:02:03,233 --> 00:02:04,153
I'm busy.

28
00:02:05,073 --> 00:02:09,523
Gorga, Ludwina and Marica need me
to help make pickles for the festival.

29
00:02:09,558 --> 00:02:12,705
Mom, what are you talking
about? Gorga? Marica?

30
00:02:12,817 --> 00:02:14,595
Marica's Ludwina's cousin.

31
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:17,000
She married the sailor
with the milky eye.

32
00:02:17,138 --> 00:02:19,402
And she knows the curse
to give you warts.

33
00:02:19,414 --> 00:02:22,564
-You're not making any sense.
-I have to go. They're calling me.

34
00:02:23,279 --> 00:02:26,700
Oh, my God, Hal. She's lost
her mind. She thinks she's
back in her old village.

35
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:27,830
I have to go up there.

36
00:02:28,034 --> 00:02:28,611
Why?

37
00:02:28,619 --> 00:02:32,411
Hal, she has one leg, she's demented.
She could wander out onto a freeway.

38
00:02:32,422 --> 00:02:36,222
I thought we agreed we'd
take no extraordinary
measures to prolong her life.

39
00:02:36,745 --> 00:02:37,401
Fine.

40
00:02:41,052 --> 00:02:41,789
There we go.

41
00:02:41,894 --> 00:02:43,702
If Mommy asks, you got a bath.

42
00:02:46,133 --> 00:02:48,137
-Did you get it?
-Oh, yeah.

43
00:02:48,369 --> 00:02:49,689
Exhumed Maniac.

44
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:53,374
The guy at the video store said it even
creeped him out, and he's an albino.

45
00:02:53,404 --> 00:02:54,805
Oh, I love scary movies.

46
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:59,241
There's nothing so primal as
a man coming face-to-face
with what really terrifies him.

47
00:02:59,428 --> 00:03:00,877
We'll keep this a secret
from your mother.

48
00:03:00,907 --> 00:03:01,257
Got it.

49
00:03:01,562 --> 00:03:03,877
There's commercials
she won't let me watch.

50
00:03:03,911 --> 00:03:06,911
Well, she's gone for five days,
we can have a film festival.

51
00:03:07,685 --> 00:03:11,534
Now, the thing about horror
films is that it's always what
they don't show that's scary,

52
00:03:11,564 --> 00:03:15,714
because nothing on the screen
can ever be as truly frightening
as what we imagin...

53
00:03:22,356 --> 00:03:24,447
I'm glad they shoved that
guy's skin down his throat.

54
00:03:24,477 --> 00:03:26,477
I didn't think he'd
ever stop screaming.

55
00:03:31,641 --> 00:03:32,741
I have a favor to ask.

56
00:03:33,196 --> 00:03:36,046
I'm taking Music Appreciation,
but I'm not doing so well.

57
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:38,232
I have to get an
"A" in this class.

58
00:03:38,497 --> 00:03:44,232
I know you know about this stuff, so
I'm willing to pay you ten bucks an hour
to teach me until I get it right, okay?

59
00:03:44,262 --> 00:03:47,415
"The Adagio for Organ and
Strings" makes you happy?

60
00:03:47,569 --> 00:03:49,169
Are you going to
help me or not?

61
00:03:49,821 --> 00:03:51,306
So let me get this straight.

62
00:03:51,508 --> 00:03:58,048
You, the brilliant genius Malcolm,
are coming to me, your little brother,
for help on your homework?

63
00:03:58,291 --> 00:03:59,541
Yes, Dewey, that's right.

64
00:04:01,127 --> 00:04:03,092
So you're a total
idiot at music?

65
00:04:04,276 --> 00:04:05,869
Yes, Dewey, it seems that way.

66
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,864
That's probably why you're
such a drag to be around.

67
00:04:11,562 --> 00:04:14,612
Yes, Dewey, that's probably why
I'm such a drag to be around.

68
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:15,674
<i>Interesting.</i>

69
00:04:16,002 --> 00:04:18,010
And that must be why
you're hitting yourself.

70
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,168
Is this gonna take long?

71
00:04:19,198 --> 00:04:20,498
Depends how fast you obey.

72
00:04:21,492 --> 00:04:24,154
And that must be why
you're hitting yourself.

73
00:04:29,689 --> 00:04:30,306
Mom.

74
00:04:30,642 --> 00:04:32,417
Oh, thank God you're all right.

75
00:04:32,571 --> 00:04:33,567
What are you doing here?

76
00:04:33,597 --> 00:04:36,097
Mrs. Kucheck next door told
me you were down here.

77
00:04:36,182 --> 00:04:38,255
She also said to stop
stealing her newspaper.

78
00:04:38,285 --> 00:04:40,484
I told her she's free
to fight me for it.

79
00:04:40,551 --> 00:04:42,802
You didn't return my
calls for two weeks.

80
00:04:42,928 --> 00:04:45,921
-I was worried.
-Oh, yes, so worried.

81
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:49,317
You get the earrings, Susan gets
the bracelet. Now go home.

82
00:04:49,327 --> 00:04:50,018
Mother...

83
00:04:51,366 --> 00:04:53,088
-What is this place?
-It's wonderful.

84
00:04:53,118 --> 00:04:56,725
It's like being back in the village.
Everyone here is from the old country.

85
00:04:56,755 --> 00:04:58,310
They got the right
kind of pickles.

86
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:04,474
They know the old songs. After
50 years in this stink-hole of a
country, I finally feel like I fit in.

87
00:05:10,315 --> 00:05:13,015
Wow, I felt surrounded when
there was just one of you.

88
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:18,003
You going to introduce her to us or
make us wait around like a pack of pigs?

89
00:05:18,076 --> 00:05:21,827
Pack of pigs wouldn't leave
their nail clippings on the floor
for other people to step on.

90
00:05:21,857 --> 00:05:23,293
This is my daughter, Lois.

91
00:05:23,766 --> 00:05:24,402
Gorga.

92
00:05:24,557 --> 00:05:25,309
Ludwina.

93
00:05:25,463 --> 00:05:26,877
Big Kathy. Little Kathy.

94
00:05:26,908 --> 00:05:28,584
Marica. Floransa.

95
00:05:28,757 --> 00:05:30,183
Anca. And Mushka.

96
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:33,040
Is this the fat daughter
or the one who drinks?

97
00:05:33,201 --> 00:05:36,654
This is the one with the half-wit
factory between her legs.

98
00:05:38,539 --> 00:05:42,939
Well, I don't know what to say.
I planned on two days to get
you into an old folks home,

99
00:05:42,954 --> 00:05:46,004
two days to fight the court challenge,
then I'd fly back on Sunday.

100
00:05:46,034 --> 00:05:48,974
Now I'm stuck here...
it's $300 just to change my ticket.

101
00:05:49,179 --> 00:05:51,485
Good. You'll be here for
the festival Saturday.

102
00:05:51,515 --> 00:05:52,325
What festival?

103
00:05:54,718 --> 00:05:55,740
You stop it.

104
00:05:56,046 --> 00:05:58,262
You know it's
Saint Grotus's Day.

105
00:05:58,392 --> 00:06:01,253
Oh, my God. Saint Grotus's Day?
That's still around?

106
00:06:01,331 --> 00:06:05,942
It is. And we haven't turned our
church into a Burger King either.

107
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:07,183
She's being modest.

108
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:11,698
She was a terrific Grotus Day
dancer. Made your children
look like poisoned sheep.

109
00:06:11,784 --> 00:06:15,088
Best girl between the
vlatnis in 15 counties!

110
00:06:15,152 --> 00:06:16,423
Not the vlatnis.

111
00:06:16,517 --> 00:06:18,670
God, I hated that
awful vlatny dance.

112
00:06:18,689 --> 00:06:20,811
You loved it. She begged to go.

113
00:06:20,821 --> 00:06:26,096
She dragged me seven blocks
by my pigtails to some stinking
butcher shop full of drunk uncles.

114
00:06:26,143 --> 00:06:29,400
I couldn't even see my feet through
the flies and the cigarette smoke.

115
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:33,799
When I was 16, I worked up the
nerve to tell her I wanted to quit. She
fed me nothing but bark for a week.

116
00:06:33,829 --> 00:06:35,894
It's her stupid idea of a joke.

117
00:06:36,774 --> 00:06:40,995
You're not around fancy big-shots
with all their teeth, sipping wine.

118
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:48,541
These are real people. You will not
embarrass me in front of my friends by spitting
on who you are and where you come from.

119
00:06:49,563 --> 00:06:50,007
Fine.

120
00:06:52,309 --> 00:06:54,528
Oh. Boshnik bread.

121
00:06:54,721 --> 00:06:56,187
I haven't had this in years.

122
00:06:56,481 --> 00:06:59,452
Does it work or just cram
its face with bread?

123
00:06:59,568 --> 00:07:00,500
She works.

124
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:03,507
And not on her back like
your slut daughter.

125
00:07:03,609 --> 00:07:07,062
Can she make a Saint
Grotus's Day tart?

126
00:07:07,087 --> 00:07:11,511
I'd have left her in the forest with her
hand nailed to a stump if she didn't.

127
00:07:12,516 --> 00:07:14,368
You will make the
tart this year.

128
00:07:14,503 --> 00:07:17,449
The tart? By myself?
That thing is gigantic.

129
00:07:17,472 --> 00:07:20,253
Yes, let Ida's daughter rest.

130
00:07:20,278 --> 00:07:24,272
The old ladies with arthritis
can make the Saint his tart.

131
00:07:24,369 --> 00:07:28,078
Ida's daughter can sit on her
gigantic ass all day and eat bread.

132
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:29,630
Jelly, dear?

133
00:07:30,039 --> 00:07:30,752
Fine.

134
00:07:30,843 --> 00:07:34,586
I'm here for five days. I was
expecting to be miserable anyway.

135
00:07:34,779 --> 00:07:35,763
I'll make the tart.

136
00:07:35,898 --> 00:07:37,789
We got it started for you.

137
00:07:46,418 --> 00:07:48,324
<i>No! Not my eyes!</i>

138
00:07:49,551 --> 00:07:51,808
<i>Not my baby's eyes, too!</i>

139
00:07:59,617 --> 00:08:00,067
Hey, Dad.

140
00:08:00,568 --> 00:08:01,468
What do you want?!

141
00:08:03,615 --> 00:08:06,415
I wanted to trade my Fruit
Roll-Up for a strawberry one?

142
00:08:09,022 --> 00:08:10,522
Sorry, son. Of course you can.

143
00:08:10,662 --> 00:08:13,068
But ask for it like a man.
Don't go creeping around the kitchen.

144
00:08:13,098 --> 00:08:15,148
I'll just come back later.
You seem busy.

145
00:08:17,303 --> 00:08:17,753
Hey, Dad.

146
00:08:17,948 --> 00:08:19,248
Check out tonight's movie.

147
00:08:19,942 --> 00:08:21,890
They Peeled My Face.

148
00:08:21,981 --> 00:08:24,431
The director went to jail
for using real corpses.

149
00:08:24,762 --> 00:08:27,424
Listen, Reese, I wanted to
talk about movie night.

150
00:08:27,523 --> 00:08:27,973
Really?

151
00:08:28,895 --> 00:08:31,667
I wasn't going to say anything 'cause
it's so gay to talk about feelings,

152
00:08:31,697 --> 00:08:34,747
but I used to feel bad that we
don't spend any time together.

153
00:08:35,411 --> 00:08:40,459
And now I find out that the one thing
I like the most, that everyone else
thinks is creepy, my dad likes it, too.

154
00:08:40,489 --> 00:08:42,920
-How great is that?
-Really great.

155
00:08:58,319 --> 00:09:02,095
Does it have to be so hot?
It's, like, 95 degrees in here.

156
00:09:02,114 --> 00:09:08,547
Yes, we'll turn on the air-conditioning
and let the tart collapse so
you can live like a movie star.

157
00:09:08,597 --> 00:09:10,976
-Let's see how you did.
-No, it's not done yet.

158
00:09:11,311 --> 00:09:16,061
I was nine hours into it when you
made me start over because the
almonds weren't facing Vadutz.

159
00:09:16,955 --> 00:09:19,849
You made vomit.

160
00:09:20,592 --> 00:09:27,873
The Saint killed our enemies, then went to hell
to ask Jesus to increase the severity of their
punishment, and you reward him with vomit?

161
00:09:27,891 --> 00:09:32,737
You might as well wipe yourself with
the beard of the Most Holy Patriarch.

162
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:35,905
Why is my tart vomit?

163
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,160
Stop your temper tantrum!

164
00:09:37,257 --> 00:09:41,290
Look here. The 15th
layer... you put apricots.

165
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:42,472
Is that correct?

166
00:09:42,549 --> 00:09:49,454
The Saint didn't slaughter the
peacemakers on the 15th. He waited
till the 16th when they trusted him.

167
00:09:49,467 --> 00:09:53,297
This thing has, like, 35 layers.
Who's gonna know where the apricots are?

168
00:09:53,341 --> 00:09:56,796
So if you steal and no one
knows, that makes it okay?

169
00:09:56,857 --> 00:10:00,177
I taught her better than that,
till my arm was going to fall off.

170
00:10:00,194 --> 00:10:01,560
She has to start over.

171
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:02,332
What?

172
00:10:02,406 --> 00:10:03,795
This is ridiculous.

173
00:10:06,129 --> 00:10:08,845
Don't blame yourself, Ida.

174
00:10:08,859 --> 00:10:10,383
She was born rotten.

175
00:10:10,674 --> 00:10:13,502
That's why the goat
refused to breast-feed her.

176
00:10:16,423 --> 00:10:20,000
Can I at least have a rag to
tie around my head to keep
the sweat out of my eyes?

177
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:22,485
Yes, Your Majesty.

178
00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:27,209
We have to start from
the very begining.

179
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:29,402
<i>What do you feel ?</i>

180
00:10:29,725 --> 00:10:31,223
I don't feel anything.

181
00:10:31,635 --> 00:10:33,485
It's just dinging,
and it's annoying.

182
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:35,107
What the hell is
wrong with you?

183
00:10:35,147 --> 00:10:36,884
Babies understand this music.

184
00:10:37,969 --> 00:10:40,881
I'll tell you what's wrong with me.
You're teaching me bad on purpose.

185
00:10:40,911 --> 00:10:43,336
Great. Now you're
stupid and crazy.

186
00:10:43,581 --> 00:10:44,106
Am I?

187
00:10:44,263 --> 00:10:47,593
I asked to learn the one thing that
makes you special, your stupid music,

188
00:10:47,623 --> 00:10:49,204
but you can't stand that, can you?

189
00:10:49,234 --> 00:10:50,969
You've been sabotaging
me from day one.

190
00:10:50,999 --> 00:10:51,938
That's it. I quit.

191
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:53,276
You can't.

192
00:10:53,605 --> 00:10:55,592
-You made a promise.
-I did not.

193
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:57,878
We tried everything
and you're an idiot.

194
00:10:59,089 --> 00:11:00,768
You are not walking
away from this, Dewey.

195
00:11:00,798 --> 00:11:02,115
You're going to
help me beat this.

196
00:11:02,145 --> 00:11:03,027
I don't care.

197
00:11:03,154 --> 00:11:04,004
Fail your course.

198
00:11:04,239 --> 00:11:05,801
I dropped that class last week.

199
00:11:06,978 --> 00:11:08,608
Then why are you bothering me?

200
00:11:08,663 --> 00:11:11,290
Because you know music and
I don't and that's not fair.

201
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,603
It's totally fair.

202
00:11:12,768 --> 00:11:17,070
You just hate that you don't
get to be better than everybody
at everything all the time.

203
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,377
Music's my only thing.
And you know what?

204
00:11:19,518 --> 00:11:25,187
It's greater than everything you
have put together, because it's
about beauty and love and feeling,

205
00:11:25,335 --> 00:11:29,684
and not about proving what
a creepy little genius you are
to everybody, so excuse me.

206
00:11:30,359 --> 00:11:32,127
I'm going to appreciate music.

207
00:11:32,721 --> 00:11:35,769
It's all the sweeter
because I know you can't.

208
00:11:40,105 --> 00:11:42,440
Oh, my God. Dewey.
Are you okay?

209
00:11:43,867 --> 00:11:44,735
I'm sorry.

210
00:11:47,633 --> 00:11:50,276
I'm deaf. I'm deaf.

211
00:11:51,614 --> 00:11:52,598
Oh, my God.

212
00:11:53,939 --> 00:11:55,989
-Mom's gonna kill us!
-Shut up. Calm down.

213
00:11:56,042 --> 00:11:57,416
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

214
00:11:57,448 --> 00:11:59,368
Your hearing will probably
come back in a while.

215
00:11:59,398 --> 00:12:01,298
Please, just don't
say anything, okay?

216
00:12:01,324 --> 00:12:02,743
Let's just keep this
quiet for a while.

217
00:12:02,773 --> 00:12:03,893
Do you understand?

218
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:08,205
Does a punch mean yes?

219
00:12:10,347 --> 00:12:10,919
Good.

220
00:12:14,338 --> 00:12:16,653
Well, I finished.

221
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,243
I almost gave up when I
thought I burned the prunes.

222
00:12:19,273 --> 00:12:21,830
But then I fell into this rhythm,
and I just lost track of time.

223
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,954
The next thing you know, it's done.

224
00:12:24,451 --> 00:12:25,733
And it came out perfect.

225
00:12:25,959 --> 00:12:28,385
It was a lot of work,
but you know something?

226
00:12:29,105 --> 00:12:29,957
It feels good.

227
00:12:31,576 --> 00:12:34,785
What's that?

228
00:12:35,106 --> 00:12:36,240
That's the real tart.

229
00:12:36,985 --> 00:12:38,272
You kept screwing up.

230
00:12:38,548 --> 00:12:42,601
We just knew it would be easier for
everyone if we just made it ourselves.

231
00:12:43,148 --> 00:12:44,559
But I worked for days!

232
00:12:45,053 --> 00:12:45,845
I'm sorry.

233
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:52,570
I know you'd rather be at the
disco shaking your backside
at a bunch of drug addicts.

234
00:12:53,258 --> 00:12:57,228
You like St. Grotus's Day?!

235
00:12:57,851 --> 00:12:58,192
Huh?!

236
00:12:58,848 --> 00:12:59,648
You like tarts?!

237
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,182
Well, what are we waiting for?

238
00:13:02,711 --> 00:13:04,485
Let's celebrate!

239
00:13:34,932 --> 00:13:43,435
Well, maybe next time you'll
think better before criticizing
other people's desserts.

240
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:46,841
What are you doing?

241
00:13:56,123 --> 00:13:56,723
Oh, Malcolm.

242
00:13:57,367 --> 00:13:58,308
I didn't hear you.

243
00:13:59,052 --> 00:13:59,978
I wonder why.

244
00:14:00,953 --> 00:14:02,253
Why don't you have a seat?

245
00:14:05,614 --> 00:14:09,264
Now I know some people say an eye for
an eye makes the whole world blind.

246
00:14:10,876 --> 00:14:12,526
But I think it's simple fairness.

247
00:14:12,721 --> 00:14:14,473
I don't know what you're talking
about. Just say what you mean.

248
00:14:14,503 --> 00:14:17,594
You seem confused.

249
00:14:17,704 --> 00:14:17,836
You want me to help you?

250
00:14:17,866 --> 00:14:19,774
Well, let's see if I can
make it loud and clear.

251
00:14:19,804 --> 00:14:20,870
I can't do it.

252
00:14:30,442 --> 00:14:33,237
I guess I'm just a better
person than you are.

253
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:46,693
You know, there's some diabetes medicine
in the fridge you may want to destroy.

254
00:14:46,723 --> 00:14:49,173
I am not going to be the
bad guy in this, Mother.

255
00:14:49,453 --> 00:14:51,506
I just want to understand
my daughter's behavior.

256
00:14:51,536 --> 00:14:53,381
Why are you so frustrated?

257
00:14:53,523 --> 00:14:57,102
Is your husband failing to
perform his shameful duty?

258
00:14:57,207 --> 00:14:58,888
Mother, just shut up,
and leave me alone.

259
00:14:58,918 --> 00:15:06,671
After all the Saint did for us, all the
enemy churches he burned, why
would you destroy his holy cookie?

260
00:15:06,783 --> 00:15:08,133
It doesn't even taste good.

261
00:15:08,338 --> 00:15:11,538
It's not supposed to taste good.
It's supposed to be hard to make.

262
00:15:11,568 --> 00:15:11,637
I can't believe you would humiliate
me in front of my friends!

263
00:15:11,667 --> 00:15:14,947
Friends?

264
00:15:15,654 --> 00:15:18,304
Those women are monsters.
They treat me like garbage.

265
00:15:18,362 --> 00:15:19,812
How can they be your friends?

266
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:21,916
I need some people
I can talk to, Lois!

267
00:15:21,946 --> 00:15:23,246
Well, you used to need me!

268
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:27,127
I'm going.

269
00:15:30,281 --> 00:15:34,980
All right. So now we're both deaf,

270
00:15:35,436 --> 00:15:36,236
but that's okay.

271
00:15:36,678 --> 00:15:40,928
We've had a while to practice
now and we're pretty confident
we can hide it from Dad!

272
00:15:41,549 --> 00:15:44,832
Boys, listen, I'm going to grab the TV
and hide it till your mother gets back.

273
00:15:44,862 --> 00:15:48,923
I'm going to tell Reese that
it was stolen by junkies,
desperate for a quick fix.

274
00:15:49,265 --> 00:15:51,931
If he ever suspects, you
didn't hear it from me. Oh!

275
00:15:52,986 --> 00:15:56,295
Hey, Dad.

276
00:15:56,942 --> 00:16:00,629
The guy at the video store finally
admitted they have a secret
room behind the snuff films.

277
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:02,109
I'm going to go check it out.

278
00:16:02,326 --> 00:16:03,823
Sounds like a plan.

279
00:16:06,712 --> 00:16:08,112
Boys... give me a hand here.

280
00:16:09,391 --> 00:16:11,623
Boys, help!

281
00:16:15,664 --> 00:16:16,057
Boys!

282
00:16:17,286 --> 00:16:18,956
Help... me!

283
00:16:24,801 --> 00:16:26,701
For God sakes,
what's wrong with you?!

284
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:29,757
Save your father's eyes!

285
00:16:39,767 --> 00:16:41,217
This makes up for everything.

286
00:16:44,423 --> 00:16:47,250
Is that supposed to impress me?

287
00:16:47,457 --> 00:16:51,342
Mother, I swear to God
I almost quit twice between
the first and the second corset.

288
00:16:51,372 --> 00:16:53,215
-I'm this close to...
-All right.

289
00:16:53,936 --> 00:16:57,467
You want to dance... we dance.

290
00:17:00,207 --> 00:17:01,012
What are you doing?

291
00:17:01,042 --> 00:17:02,542
I'm not dancing in this thing.

292
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,105
It just gets in the way.

293
00:17:09,596 --> 00:17:11,850
Begin we now the wushny sabor!

294
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:15,642
The dance where mistakes
are long remembered.

295
00:18:27,453 --> 00:18:29,091
More drinking!

296
00:18:29,685 --> 00:18:30,270
Noroc!

297
00:18:32,921 --> 00:18:33,621
Noroc, Mother.

298
00:18:33,634 --> 00:18:34,152
Noroc.

299
00:18:38,611 --> 00:18:39,605
The lato vlatnis.

300
00:18:40,978 --> 00:18:42,444
Hard as a Cossack's heart.

301
00:18:43,207 --> 00:18:45,208
Sharp as a raven's beak.

302
00:18:49,175 --> 00:18:51,011
Oh, crap. I hate the knives.

303
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:58,278
You think your dad getting
killed by a TV set is funny?!

304
00:18:58,724 --> 00:18:59,933
I'll tell you what's funny!

305
00:18:59,963 --> 00:19:02,124
Being grounded for the
rest of your lives!

306
00:19:02,385 --> 00:19:05,840
After about an hour, he managed to
spit a piece of glass into my lap.

307
00:19:06,239 --> 00:19:07,919
You got to admire that
kind of perseverance.

308
00:19:07,949 --> 00:19:12,498
Your children and your
children's children will grow
up grounded in this house!

309
00:19:13,061 --> 00:19:14,346
I can't hear what he's saying.

310
00:19:14,376 --> 00:19:17,873
But judging by the color of
his face, I probably shouldn't
ask for the car this weekend.

311
00:19:17,903 --> 00:19:20,153
Dad, come on.
I've got something to show you.

312
00:19:21,758 --> 00:19:26,314
We'll use this system until Mom
comes home, then say it was
defective, and get a refund.

313
00:19:26,653 --> 00:19:29,197
Tonight's going to feel like we're
actually inside the guy's torso.

314
00:19:29,227 --> 00:19:31,312
Son, sit down.

315
00:19:33,932 --> 00:19:34,769
Listen...

316
00:19:36,535 --> 00:19:38,533
These movies are torture for me.

317
00:19:39,924 --> 00:19:44,761
I chewed blisters into my
fingers, I can't sleep, I'm
afraid of everything. But...

318
00:19:45,885 --> 00:19:48,185
I love you, and I love
spending time with you.

319
00:19:48,945 --> 00:19:49,299
Oh.

320
00:19:50,692 --> 00:19:52,146
Like me and baseball.

321
00:19:52,843 --> 00:19:53,359
What?

322
00:19:53,873 --> 00:19:59,673
Like when you were so excited to
teach me baseball when I was six, and
I couldn't tell you how totally boring it is.

323
00:20:00,257 --> 00:20:03,163
But... that look on your face
when I got you your first mitt?

324
00:20:03,193 --> 00:20:06,193
It's the same face I use when
I get underwear for Christmas.

325
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:08,411
"Wow, it's like
you read my mind!"

326
00:20:11,615 --> 00:20:12,415
It's not so bad.

327
00:20:13,323 --> 00:20:15,273
We're both just liars
for a good cause.

328
00:20:15,286 --> 00:20:15,804
Yeah.

329
00:20:16,695 --> 00:20:18,249
Like that stupid camping trip.

330
00:20:18,895 --> 00:20:20,195
I loved that camping trip.

331
00:20:20,911 --> 00:20:21,911
That's what I meant.

332
00:20:22,442 --> 00:20:24,546
Hi, Dewey.

333
00:20:25,108 --> 00:20:25,995
Mom.

334
00:20:26,523 --> 00:20:27,211
Your voice.

335
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:29,144
Your beautiful voice.

336
00:20:29,805 --> 00:20:31,117
I can hear you.

337
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:34,383
Well, it's nice to
see you too, honey.

338
00:20:38,792 --> 00:20:42,001
Every morning those damn
birds. They can't keep...

339
00:20:43,828 --> 00:20:45,011
Wait. I can hear.

340
00:20:53,029 --> 00:20:55,554
I can hear. Oh, my
God, I'm so happy.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
